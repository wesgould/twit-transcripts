[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.440]   mac-- oh, my hair is a mess.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.160]   Oh, I guess we'll do the show anyway.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.640]   Covers all your mac-- it's raining here.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080]   All your Macintosh needs.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.920]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.640]   Leo Le Port here.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.440]   Andy Inacos here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.240]   in the celestial wish to bandwidth wearing his glass.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.880]   There you go.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   Looked like a pretty cool spot where they gave you the glass.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.480]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.040]   It was fun being in New York City.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.680]   But I can imagine myself wondering
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   if I lived in Chicago or in the Midwest thinking.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   So not only do I have to pay $1,500 for these,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.720]   but I also have to spend $300 to go someplace to pick them up.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.600]   The mail service does not reach from Mountain View,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.000]   California to my house.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.640]   Is that the problem, Google?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   Well, I'm glad you got it.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.120]   We'll get your thoughts about it in just a second.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.080]   Must've feist.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200]   Let's introduce the rest of our panel, Jason Snow,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.600]   for my CG is here.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.960]   Editorial Director 4.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.880]   Macworld being the most relevant for the show.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.400]   Macworld.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.760]   Also PCworld.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   We don't like to mention those other ones, but anyway.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.440]   All of them.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.320]   All of the above.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.680]   Yep.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.360]   It was great to see you.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.400]   I'd love to see you.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.040]   On a rainy day in Northern California.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.520]   It was a lot of rainy day.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.040]   I think California, we get confused when it rains.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200]   Yeah, because it's not supposed to rain after June.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.280]   It's not supposed to rain after June 1st.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.680]   And we got a big studio audience.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.720]   They came out in the rain.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.320]   And it's still snowing in Montreal.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.760]   That's why Rene Richie is doing the show from Indoor.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.440]   I don't know.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.200]   What's the weather like in Montreal, Rene?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   It's a downpour, Leo.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360]   It's been horrendous winds and rain.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.480]   I've lost power several times.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.920]   The whole world is topsy-turvy.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.600]   It's ends times.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.040]   I don't know what to do with melted water.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   It was falling from this guy.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.200]   Rene's with iMore.com.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.800]   And just thank you for the plug that you guys gave me on your talk.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   What was it called?
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.320]   Talkmobile.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.600]   Talkmobile.com.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.920]   And we have lots more of you coming up in future weeks.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.360]   Got a lot of response.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.240]   So that's an ongoing thing, huh?
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   Yeah, we're doing it 10 weeks every other week.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.560]   So it'll be 20 weeks in total.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   But it's on every second week.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.320]   It's not talkmobile.com.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.000]   I apologize.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.480]   Talk mobile.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.240]   Sorry, talkmobile2013.com.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.760]   There you go.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.400]   Some other company has the Talkmobile.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.040]   Talkmobile2013.com.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.840]   And I presume you've reserved 2014, '15, '16, though.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.480]   We might have done it for a decade.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   Just in case.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520]   Just in case.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.560]   But next week is social.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.760]   So the deal's going to share his thoughts on social with us next week.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.840]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.920]   You know, the question that you aired this week was, is it better--
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.880]   and I think it's a great question which I hedged, I hate to say--
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.720]   is it better to have apps or HTML5 on your web apps or app apps?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.560]   And I hedged it.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.720]   Because on the one hand, I think you could do some amazing things
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.920]   with native apps.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.480]   But in the long run, I think what you really want in the world
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.920]   is the open freedom of the web, even on a mobile device.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.480]   And what was funny is we asked-- and I won't name the publication
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.400]   they work for, but we asked a couple developers who
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.640]   work for a major publication.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.800]   And their response was, we don't want to live in a world where HTML5
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.920]   is the user experience.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   So we've got a wide range of opinions.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   Isn't that an interesting one?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.060]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   Actually, I wouldn't mind talking a little more about that.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.360]   Because here's the question.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.800]   Because when the iPhone came out, it didn't have apps.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   It had web apps.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   And Steve said, very famously, that's all you'd ever need.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.840]   These are great.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.920]   Sweet solution.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.680]   Back down about six months later.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   Do you think that that was something planned all along?
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560]   Jason, what do you think?
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.320]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.560]   I think at the time--
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   It was actually on a podcast.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.360]   And we talked about it with John Gruber and Merlin Mann.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.400]   And we all said that there was going to be an app store
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.280]   with actual apps.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.880]   Oh, you guys knew.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.680]   Well, I think it was obvious to everybody
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.840]   that the web app thing was not going to work.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.640]   And the question is, did Steve Jobs think
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.360]   that was going to be all and everybody else was working
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   in the background on it?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   Or was it always meant to be just a placeholder?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.720]   Because they were still trying to build the OS
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.400]   and didn't have time to give a third party development
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.360]   system out.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.080]   They were barely-- they were trying to ship the product.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.240]   Do you think you, Gruber and Mann,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.360]   would change your tune today with HTML5 more mature
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.120]   and more capabilities?
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.840]   Yeah, well, I think the last one was here.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.480]   It was amazing.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.640]   I showed that forecast.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.320]   Look, SEO, yeah.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.240]   Yeah, which feels like an app.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.960]   I don't know.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.080]   There's some stuff-- even when web OS,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.920]   we saw that for some stuff like games, especially,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.120]   you really needed something more.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.080]   But we're a lot closer than we were.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.520]   Certainly for games.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   At Google I/O, one of the developer tracks
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.440]   was this new thing that Google's
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.960]   doing for their Chromebooks called packaged apps.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.600]   So that is technically a web app,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.400]   but it has window-winged accesses the hardware
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.360]   and is designed to have both online and offline modes.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.560]   So if you're-- I'm not sure if anybody would prefer
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.840]   to do all of their work through a browser window,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.520]   but if they can make the user interface,
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.480]   so rich that there's just not much of a difference
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   between a multi-window desktop interface and a web interface,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.320]   well, many people even notice the difference.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.360]   Right.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.160]   We asked a ton of developers, and there is exactly what Andy
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   said.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   There's Native Client.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.960]   There's also OpenGL-- not OpenSL,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.000]   WebGL, which is porting OpenGL to the web,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.360]   which will try to help with gaming.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.600]   But at the end of the day, the consensus
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.480]   seems to be that for a class of apps, HTML5 will be fine,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.600]   but you'll always be able to do more with native,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.640]   because as the power and technology grows to make HTML5
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   better, it'll also make native apps better.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.400]   So it just depends on how close to the metal
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.200]   you need to write your app.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.520]   I guess there's always going to be a place for apps.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.760]   But then you look at something like Chrome OS, which Google's
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.680]   really-- and I have some skepticism about Chrome OS,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.480]   but that is basically all HTML5 all the time.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.680]   Yeah, but I use a Chromebook for a week, the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.880]   And Google does a really good job with their web apps.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.000]   And if every web app was as good as Google's web apps,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   I think they'd really have something.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.040]   But the fact is we're not even close to that.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.600]   And most of the so-called apps in the Chrome App Store
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.640]   are like web pages with flash games embedded in them
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.560]   and things like that.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.000]   Flash is cheating.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.680]   Most web apps are awful.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.920]   And Google can say that because they have really good ones.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   But we're just not there yet.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.240]   Yeah, but it's an interesting approach.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   I've now used the Chromebook Pixel for three weeks now.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.240]   And I sort of had to go into that phase of testing where, gee,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.680]   this is working out really well.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.240]   I'm going to now use this as my sole mobile PC
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.560]   when I leave the office just to see where the breaking point is.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.680]   And it's very, very sturdy.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.280]   Relying on web apps for that limited range of things
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.600]   I do when I'm outside of the office.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.000]   So when you talk about competition for a real notebook,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.920]   no, not at all.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.040]   But when you start to look at it as a solution for,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.760]   we need to build good computers that cost less than $500.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.880]   How do we do it?
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.160]   You start to have to let go of the idea of Windows or Mac OS
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.960]   or even iOS and start to say, well, what do we really, really
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.440]   need this thing to do in order to deliver that sort of use
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.160]   case?
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.880]   And as you keep driving that price down,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.520]   when you get to $300, really the only viable solution
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   is a Chromebook.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.880]   And the Chromebook will-- at $300, the Chromebook
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   will kick the absolute butt off of any other solution,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.200]   even up to $400.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.840]   And I'm including an iPad with--
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.560]   an iPad because you have to buy the iPad.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.280]   You have to buy the keyboard.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.480]   And then you have to navigate like a multi-handed interface
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.360]   because it doesn't support a mouse or a trackpad.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.240]   So I think it'll find its niche so long as they keep focusing
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.960]   on what it's good at.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.640]   I'm not sure a $1,300 notebook is the right platform
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.320]   for Chrome OS though.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.280]   Well, I think even Google knows it.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.000]   Yes.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.480]   That's nice.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.440]   That's why they gave them away at Google I/O.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.960]   It was just a show it could be done, but I don't think--
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.760]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   You're right, Andy.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.080]   It's a $200 laptop with no maintenance overhead.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.800]   Especially organizations that buy PC laptops now, let's say,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.120]   even more than Mac laptops.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.040]   And having an auto-updating device like that that's cheap.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.920]   And essentially, in some ways, disposable.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.600]   And still, we'll do Google Docs and Google Apps.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   Let me give you a preview.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.320]   Sometimes the universe hands you trouble in a way of saying,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.080]   but you can use this in the column that you're writing soon.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   I had this thing happening where you wake up,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.600]   you check your email, the editor says,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.760]   oh, got your copy last night.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.240]   Looks great.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.800]   Can you give us a couple pictures?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.400]   And I realized, OK, I've got the thing back in my office.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.080]   I can take it into my studio, have pictures in 15 minutes.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   If I'll take five minutes of editing,
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.760]   if I promise that it'll be there in 40 minutes, no problem.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.640]   20 minutes to take the pictures.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.920]   And then after that, my main MacBook failed.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.520]   Spinning Beach Ball all day long.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.640]   The computer that I had, the other MacBook I have that I only
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.000]   use here in the studio for reference also failed.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.160]   Really, it was the Chromebook.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.920]   It was the only one that was actually reliable enough
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.720]   that no spinning beach ball, no weights.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.240]   And unlike the iPad, it actually-- oh, an SD card.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.400]   I know about SD cards.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.240]   Just put it in SD card in me.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.880]   Now we'll be able to take that photo and send it to somebody.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.640]   So it's a very, very wide variety of use cases.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.680]   And sometimes you have to at least acknowledge that if you do--
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.040]   Apple is right in the sense that the more you limit what
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.000]   a computer can do, the more you increase the likelihood
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.120]   that that thing is going to be able to do the things it's
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.760]   able to do more reliably.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.120]   When we come back, I want to talk about the Wi-Fi issues
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.240]   and the MacBook Air.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.680]   I'm sitting with a new Air.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   Out here, it's fine.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.920]   But if I go where it's somewhat weaker,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   I do get some drops.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   Let's see if that's-- is that real or imagined?
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.120]   We'll also talk a little bit about iOS 7, the iPad version.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   It's out in beta 2 for the iPhone.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.640]   He's out, so let's just talk about there.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.000]   But first, a word from Shutter Stack.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.040]   Do you guys ever use--
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.880]   you probably don't need to.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.520]   You probably have photographers out in the field all the time,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.760]   Jason, taking pictures any time you need images.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.320]   We have some of that, and we also use Shutter Stack.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.280]   I know who--
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.400]   Chicago Sun-Times probably using a lot of Shutter Stack lately.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.440]   $25 million stock--
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   boom!
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.360]   $25 million stock photos, illustrations, vectors, and videos.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.400]   I'm willing to bet a few photo journalists are putting
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.040]   their photos up here, because Shutter Stack is a great place
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.120]   to sell pictures as well as get royalty free.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.760]   Somebody tweeted me, hey, how come I keep getting EPS instead
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.360]   of JPEGs?
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   Well, it depends what you get.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.600]   If you get illustrations or vectors,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.960]   you're going to get an EPS.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.800]   If you want a photo, you can get a JPEG.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.760]   You can actually get in a variety of formats.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.440]   The best thing about Shutter Stack is the search.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.680]   Unbelievable.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.400]   I mean, first you've got the categories down here.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.280]   But with the search, you could search for a topic.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   Then you can qualify it with an emotion or a gender.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.120]   Let's do happy hippos.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.960]   Why not?
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   Do you think we'll find any?
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.320]   God, wait, there's a lot of happy hippos on Shutter Stack.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.120]   19 pages of a happy hippos.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.960]   Not angry hippos.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.120]   That's just an example.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.920]   By the way, hippos may look happy,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.240]   but don't mess with them.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.080]   More people die from hippo attacks every year than sharks.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080]   Just want you to know.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.280]   A little public safety message from Twit.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.040]   The more you know.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.840]   Back to Shutter Stack.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.360]   Here's the deal.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.480]   Shutter Stack has subscriptions and images on demand.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.960]   A variety of different packages.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.600]   I'm going to tell you how you can really save.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.760]   I love the search that you can even
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.360]   qualify with their spectrum tool.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.040]   So you could say, I want to search for green stuff,
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.320]   or blue stuff, or green angry hippos,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.200]   or blue angry hippos.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.280]   This selection, the variety, it's amazing.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.600]   It's also a great inspiration.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.440]   In fact, you can create a free Shutter Stack account
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.080]   and just use it for inspiration.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.840]   Enter in an idea, a concept, look for some images.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.440]   Save them to your light box.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.840]   You could share your light box with others
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.000]   or just save it for future reference.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.200]   And if you decide you want to buy,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   it's a great deal.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   If you use our offer code MAC break six, we'll take 10%.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.760]   I'm sorry, did I say 10?
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.480]   How about 30% off your first purchase with a new account?
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.200]   The subscription would be a very good deal in that case.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.240]   30% off with the offer code MAC break six.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.760]   That's good through the month of June
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.640]   because it's the sixth month.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   Shutterstock.com, truly a global company
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.920]   they've got offices all over the world, language is galore.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   So I know we have a lot of international viewers.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.320]   This is good worldwide.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.680]   Shutterstock.com offer code MAC break six.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.480]   I don't know if it's a story or not.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   Maybe you guys do.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.280]   The MacBook Air Wi-Fi issues.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.560]   Not the first time a new Apple product had Wi-Fi issues.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.360]   Adpads are notorious for that.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.200]   Every time.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.840]   Why is it?
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.560]   Is Apple doing something unusual?
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.240]   Sounds like them.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.080]   Anybody?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.840]   (laughing)
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.920]   I wouldn't say I'm having Wi-Fi problems at home
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.240]   where I'm using the new airport extreme.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.000]   It works very well all over the house.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.640]   I don't have any problems.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.480]   Out here where we're near the,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.240]   our access points are out here in the big studio.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.520]   I've not had any problems.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.840]   But I have had pretty regular dropouts in my office
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.000]   that I did not have on earlier devices
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.720]   or other companies computers.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.440]   So maybe there is something going on.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.760]   Is it perhaps that lease issue that they had before?
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.320]   There's hardware and software that could potentially be at work.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.200]   It's interesting that they're trying to collect some units
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.280]   where people have complained about this to check it out, to see.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.080]   They actually said, "We want to, if you have it,
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.800]   "somebody comes in with a bad unit, capture it."
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.480]   'Cause there could be bad hardware.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.520]   There could be bad software on the Wi-Fi chip.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.960]   And there could be a bad interaction with the operating system.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.120]   I have an 11-inch MacBook Air from two years ago,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.760]   and a couple months ago it started kind of
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.560]   randomly dropping Wi-Fi.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.360]   And the hardware seems to have been fine historically,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.160]   but I suspect that there's something weird in an OS update
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.880]   that's caused it to behave strangely.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.560]   And it's such a complex problem.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   And a lot of this Wi-Fi stuff, Apple seems to do a lot of testing
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.680]   before they release a product.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.600]   But whatever they're doing, there are some instances
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.080]   that they just don't test for.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.520]   And then this keeps happening
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.800]   where they end up having to find things out in the wild.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.520]   Just to be safe, what does it exactly?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.000]   What do they mean, capture?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.320]   Like if I brought this into the Apple Store,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.520]   and I said, "I'm having trouble, would they just take it from me?"
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.360]   There's a butterfly in that.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   A large matter.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.880]   What do they mean?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.600]   Every time you buy a brand new release product,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.640]   if there's a problem within the first two or three weeks,
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.160]   don't put it off, take it right back to the Apple Store.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   Right.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.440]   Because the Genius Bar essentially has, like,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.320]   hiding licenses from Cupertino,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.080]   where the engineers say, "I'm looking--"
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.160]   "We're looking for--"
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.800]   If the new iPhone 5S comes out,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.040]   anybody--any phones have been dropped,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.760]   any phones that have problems getting connectivity,
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.040]   any phones that have audio issues,
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.760]   they essentially put a bounty saying,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.120]   "We're trying to get six of those problems from you
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.800]   sometime in the next two or three weeks."
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.000]   And what happens is that it goes into a beautiful,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.160]   like, Spock in Star Trek II-style casket,
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   sealed up and banded and goes right back to engineers at Apple.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.360]   So they just swap it.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   And they will swap you out.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.560]   Whereas instead of trying to fix it,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   or there's a good chance you'll walk out of there
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.840]   with a brand new, fixed thing.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.160]   And I am talking about, even if you drop your iPhone
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.760]   and you were dumb and you broke the screen,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.560]   there is a chance that they've been said.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.040]   We want the examples of phones that have been dropped
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.520]   and you had their screens cracked.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.880]   You actually have a chance that you will get
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.640]   a swapped-out phone under those circumstances.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.720]   - Do you first-done person, please?
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.800]   - It was the first one.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.200]   My problems are so intermittent that I don't know
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   if it's me, it's just maybe it's not as strong
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.520]   an antenna as it used to be, or I don't know.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   Should I bring it in just 'cause it drops in the office
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.640]   than it never did before?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.560]   I don't know, I guess I will.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.760]   - You might as well, I mean, when it costs you nothing,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.880]   and the geniuses, they're so hygienically
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.760]   in their personal hygiene and they smile
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.920]   and they're very nice, and some of them
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.040]   have really interesting tattoos that you can talk about.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.360]   I mean, there's no reason not to hear things like that.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.240]   I see you finally got that carp colored in, excellent.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.680]   - Yes, I mean, the question would be,
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.880]   is this a hardware issue or a software issue?
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.280]   In the past, it's always been fixable
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.320]   with the firmware update.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.560]   - Yeah, the inontech review of the new areas.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   - By the way, great review.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.240]   - Great review, and he seems to think that it's a software
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.920]   issue, he did a little bit of analysis
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.200]   and seems to think that this is an issue
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   where the lots of geeky networking things,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.880]   there's a bad software implementation
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.080]   that's making a drop when the signals are weaker.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.320]   So I hope so, that's the easiest solution
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.480]   'cause then Apple can just push out a software update
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.320]   and fix it.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.920]   - Yeah, as they have in the past.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.600]   - Yeah, I guess every case I can think of.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.120]   - My guess is most likely it's that
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.760]   because they're using presumably a stock part for this
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.720]   that works.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.120]   - Well, but it is AC, right?
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.360]   So these are all new chipsets.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.280]   - But then Apple writes custom drivers for everything.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.120]   - Exactly.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.920]   - Yeah, yeah, non's article, which is something
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   13 or something pages.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   - As usual from a non, you just get the most
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.200]   of aluminous stuff, really did a great job.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.520]   He also pointed out an issue with AC,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.680]   with the SMB stack, the file sharing stack,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.880]   being so slow, so crappy, that you wouldn't notice
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.960]   any benefit from, he said, I was trying to use the AC
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.800]   to copy files, and I had noticed this too.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.160]   I have the airport AC, and the file copy was really,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.440]   not only not any faster, it felt sluggish.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.920]   He said it's a bad software stack on file sharing
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.560]   with the SMB and Apple sharing,
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.600]   and that when he set up an FTP server,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   it was--
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.760]   - It's a lot faster.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.400]   - 533 megabits or whatever.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.360]   So yeah, thank, and he's in England.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.680]   He's like in his, on a traveling,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.240]   but he has 18 laptops in his backpack,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.960]   so he's just able to do all of this.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.920]   - Tays him a long time to go through security.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.080]   - Can you imagine?
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   - He's so good. - Imagine.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.440]   Just to some, I would agree 100% with his summer,
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.600]   summation, which is the air, as continues to be,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.080]   the kind of the creme de la creme of this thin and light,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.480]   there's nothing better, great trackpad.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.840]   I'm a little disappointed that Apple isn't, you know,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.040]   giving us a higher resolution display,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.280]   and if you want that, you probably will want to wait
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.560]   for the 13, he said the PowerHorses 13-inch MacBook retina,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.000]   but pro with retina, but if what you want
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.640]   is extraordinary battery life,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.160]   and just a beautiful system,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   there's nothing wrong with MacBook Air.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.920]   In fact, there's some real improvements.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.640]   The SSD on here is PCIe 2, and it's very fast.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.720]   I mean, we did a benchmark last week,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.000]   and I was blown away faster,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.160]   even than the PCI Express card that I put in my Mac Pro.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.520]   - I think the 13-inch Air is the sweet spot
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.960]   of Apple's laptop line, too,
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.880]   and that's where they did the price reduction.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.800]   That's 10.99 now when it used to 11.99.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.040]   - Yeah, I was gonna say,
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.680]   I think that Apple should take that sticker off the Retina MacBook
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.200]   and say that this is the best Mac that Apple's ever made,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   'cause in terms of features that really, really do reach
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.200]   to consumers and availability to consumers,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.840]   I can't think of any Mac they've ever made
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.680]   that can top this.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.280]   This is a fantastic notebook.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.440]   - As he points out, they're using a large die has well
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.840]   that is not a typical part.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.560]   And a lot of the, like the Acer S7,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.320]   which I have, the Haswell version of that
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.600]   does not use the same chip.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.240]   This is a better chip.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.000]   It's 150 bucks to go to i7, I did,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.240]   'cause I'm like geek, I'm thinking,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.440]   and I did this with your,
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.840]   I'm thinking the basic stock one for,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.920]   what is it, 10.99?
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   - 10.99 for the 13-inch.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.800]   That's the way to go from most people.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.080]   Very few people wanna go fast.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.600]   - If I was talking to somebody who was sending
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.120]   a kid off to college or something like that,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   I'd say, personally, I like the 11-inch,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.560]   but for most people, they want the more screen real estate
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   and 10.99, that's what I'd recommend.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.040]   I mean, it's a really, and that's so fast.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.080]   I have a two-year-old air, 11-inch air,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.680]   and it is the i7 version, but it's two years old.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.040]   I can edit, I have never had a processor-related slowdown.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.920]   I mean, I can edit stuff in Photoshop, Giant Files,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   and I can edit audio, like 10 multiple audio tracks
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.280]   at once in Logic, and it doesn't drop.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.960]   And these things are remarkably fast.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.400]   They're faster than any person would ever want
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   for any normal use.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.040]   - They did drop the clock speed on the chip
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.960]   compared to last year's MacBook Air.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.800]   - Right.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   - And in some synthetic benchmarks, it's slower, but--
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   - Overall, it's basically a push.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.920]   - The point of view of using it, it's absolutely push.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.040]   And the faster SSD, the faster I/O does,
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.880]   I mean, it boots and seconds.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.040]   - And by dropping the clock speed,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.600]   that's where you get on your battery savings.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.960]   - Right, yeah.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.640]   And are you guys all getting that 12 hours?
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.200]   - I am, but I'm not doing any,
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   if I start revving up Final Cut Pro
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.440]   and rendering video after video,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   it goes down substantially.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.280]   - Well, whatever I'm doing.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.480]   - Whatever, surprise, yeah.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.360]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.840]   And I guess, also when people buy a new computer
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   and they use it constantly and they complain
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.880]   about battery life, you have to meter it down
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.280]   to your normal use schedule.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.560]   But if I'm just sitting at a cafe,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.400]   and this is what I literally did,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.120]   I went to a cafe and just sat there
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.480]   and used web apps and stuff,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.360]   it lasted longer than I could sit at a cafe,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.720]   which is a really long time.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.160]   - And presumably, Mavericks will make
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.440]   an even bigger difference.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.120]   That's the other side of this.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.760]   The OS will take advantage of some of the--
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.880]   - The OS and some of the apps will be rewritten
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.240]   to do that app-nap stuff.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.440]   And there'll be some serious energy savings,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.680]   so it should be better.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.360]   - Chad, do you not see my screen?
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.160]   Is that what's going on?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.640]   You can't see my screen.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.560]   Oh, okay.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.360]   Yeah, I would like to show these.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.560]   This is the battery tests that Anand did.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.440]   And his results are as one would expect,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.240]   which is if you use it lightly,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.160]   he's getting about 11 hours
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   compared to 7.5 hours.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.600]   It's really all, 12 hours is the wrong thing to say.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.240]   It's really relative to your usage,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   and last year's MacBook,
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.080]   or you're gonna get about 50% improvement.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.680]   'Cause that's really,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.400]   'cause it's how you use it that has everything.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.720]   - Right, any synthetic battery test,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.000]   people will make a guess,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.080]   oh, this much web browsing,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.240]   this much file downloading,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.080]   it's never gonna match exactly how you use it,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.280]   but you can look at the difference.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.400]   - The difference is the key.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.720]   - Right, and here we're seeing hours
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.160]   of improvement last year's model.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.520]   - So this is nine hours on a medium workload
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.440]   compared to five and a third hours,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.400]   and last year's MacBook here.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.240]   And frankly, I'm probably the guy who's using heavy workload.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.800]   He says the key is,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.640]   if you've got 12 tabs open,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.120]   many of those tabs are still working in the background.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.400]   It's idle time that's key on all of this.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.480]   Don't have flash running on a blank,
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.920]   on a tab on a browser,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.960]   you're not looking at,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.880]   close the tabs or things like that.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.280]   - I mean, it also depends, it's very dependent,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.840]   and I don't know if this is true with this MacBook,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.680]   'cause I haven't tried this yet,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.000]   but in previous MacBooks, especially the pros,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.240]   a lot of developers would use core animation
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.560]   just to make good looking effects
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   or render text, - Yeah.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.640]   - And that would turn on the screen GPU.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.480]   - Yeah.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.560]   - Like I know if I turn off Chrome,
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.200]   my battery life goes right back up
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.160]   because Google's doing a lot of the fancy GPU stuff,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.200]   so it really depends on the apps you're using as well.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.640]   - I think he does say though,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.760]   and I'm doing this from memory,
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.640]   I read this a couple of days ago,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.800]   that the GPU is on a lot in this MacBook Air.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.280]   Anyway, that Apple doesn't,
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.440]   isn't aggressive about turning it off,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.480]   and I'm not sure, I'll have to go back and look at it.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.800]   But the bottom line on battery life,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.920]   he is, the title of this page is,
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.840]   absolutely insane battery life,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.280]   but the bottom line is 65% over what you were getting last year.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.800]   So if you had a MacBook 2012, expect,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.200]   and you were getting whatever you were getting,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.280]   four hours, six hours, eight hours, expect 65% better.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.760]   That's good because even Intel only claims half improvement,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.920]   50% improvement on the as well.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.680]   So obviously Apple's doing some,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.640]   the battery's a little bigger,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.040]   they're doing some secret sauce in there.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.480]   - Clearly, Apple has a,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.920]   you know on the iPad and the iPhone,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.160]   Apple has still, for the last few years,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.360]   had this push of, we're gonna make them thinner and lighter,
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.000]   and the battery life has basically stayed the same.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.320]   And on the laptops, clearly with this generation,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.880]   they decided that was where they were gonna put their focus,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.800]   is making the battery life more.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   Everything else is basically the same,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.400]   but the battery life is much better,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.480]   which I think was a good call,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.120]   because laptops should live longer off of one charge
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   than Apple's laptops have the last few years.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.760]   - It's a good feature, full stop,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.080]   but also you have to think about
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   what could they add to the MacBook Air this year
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.400]   that would be really, really apparent to users.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.640]   They're not getting retinue,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.840]   they're not getting case design,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.440]   they're not getting new ports.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   So yeah, if I would love to have heard
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.320]   some sort of discussion inside Apple,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.480]   where they're saying, as is right now,
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.200]   we're giving exactly, we're promising,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.640]   we're the slide in the next keynote says,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.160]   and despite our incredible,
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.640]   this incredible boost in performance,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   you get exactly the same battery life,
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.280]   and then someone in the back raised their hands
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.080]   and says, what if we made that slide into,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.520]   and the battery's now lasting 65% longer?
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.560]   So yeah, let's change that slide,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.840]   and let's do some engineering to make sure
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.920]   that slide is true.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.320]   - Yeah. - 'Cause that does make it
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.120]   this into a buy it now, sort of laptop as opposed to it.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.600]   Oh, that's nice, maybe in the year
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.160]   when I need another laptop, I'll buy it in here.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.800]   - On the other hand, if battery,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.400]   if you're not using the battery a lot,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   you're not living in coffee shops or on airplanes,
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.920]   I'm plugged in most of the time,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.800]   so it's not an issue for me,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.600]   and it might be that you would wanna wait for the retina,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.760]   13 inch retina, if portability and battery life aren't key,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.960]   I have to say, the screen resolution
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.120]   is feeling a little antiquated,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.440]   with most of the new Windows laptops having 1080p screens,
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.520]   this 1440 by 900 feels a little bit antiquated.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.560]   It is also not IPS, I mean, it's kind of an older technology.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.640]   - Yeah, I use the 11 inch, and I don't have a problem,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   but I use the 11 inch, I'm a crazy person.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.520]   - You're crazy, yeah.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.360]   I couldn't take it.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.400]   - But retina, it's inevitable,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.040]   the question is, will it be next year or not?
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.920]   I think the fact that they're adding battery and battery life,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.800]   and all that in this model,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.840]   what's one thing you need a lot of battery for
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.920]   is to do the video card, to do the retina display.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.520]   So I think they're working up to it,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   but that's the matter, do you wanna wait a year
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.000]   or two for another laptop?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.720]   - And that's interesting, that's interesting too.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.160]   Have they sort of dug themselves
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.280]   into a little bit of a hole here?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.000]   Because it's okay for them to not mention the process,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.080]   the processor speed, but say,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.920]   "Hey look how much better the battery life is."
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.160]   Does that mean that a year from now,
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.360]   when they do a retina MacBook Air,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   and maybe if, have they put this off in this position
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.480]   where they can't say that,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.000]   "Oh, and you're taking about a three hour battery hit
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.960]   for the retina display, but hey look, retina display."
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.520]   Or, now, do they have now the challenge where,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   whatever we do, we have to maintain the same level of battery,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.520]   or at least maybe knock off an hour at most of it,
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.360]   but still be able to say,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.760]   you will get all day battery on this,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.880]   even though you have a retina display.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.360]   - Apple's done that before, I recall,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.720]   where they've had that, even with the iPad 3,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.360]   and it's like, but it's retina,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.760]   yeah, it's a little thicker and heavier,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   but it's retina, isn't that awesome?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.960]   And I think the question is what the difference is,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.120]   if it's really, really worst battery life,
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.240]   like cut in half, it's a harder story to tell,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.760]   but if it's down a couple of hours,
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.080]   they'll mess it.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.800]   - Yeah, but it's running on arm,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.080]   and it's using a modern UI,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.320]   no one's gonna pay attention to the battery life.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.160]   - There's also two panels, right?
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.040]   They're, if, non got the nice Samsung panel,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.920]   I think there's, is it LG is the other?
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.960]   It's hit or miss, it's a random,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.720]   depending on which panel you're gonna get.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.080]   Apparently, some of them are a little bit better.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   Do you like the Samsung a little bit better?
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.800]   Anyway, you know, it's fine.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.160]   It's just when you have everything else's retina.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.400]   And you go to this, I just feel like,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.520]   - They've got their differentiator.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.520]   Everything non retina is light and thin and small,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.440]   like the iPad Mini or the MacBook Air,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.120]   and everything that is retina is bigger
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.640]   and more powerful and, you know,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.920]   something I'm asking your choice.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.600]   - Yeah, maybe I'm at the center.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   I mean, I certainly do appreciate the difference
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.920]   between a retina screen,
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.280]   but given that the distance
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.760]   that I'm usually viewing a laptop screen at,
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.160]   it's not quite so in my face.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.520]   I appreciate the difference, but it doesn't,
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.520]   I don't have that same,
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.240]   ooh, what's this going on now?
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.920]   I can't refuse to even touch it.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.480]   - Well, we work in text a lot too,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.000]   and although the text has crisp and nice,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.120]   and I can see it, it doesn't,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.400]   it doesn't make as big a difference as looking at photos.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.200]   Looking at photos on the Retinomack book blows me away.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.600]   Looking at text, it's nice.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.520]   - Oh, no, it makes a difference to me.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.720]   I really, I mean, I could,
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.240]   you could put, you could do an A/B test,
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.080]   and I could look at this.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.000]   - Oh, I could tell the difference.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.080]   - Immediately go, it doesn't show me.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.440]   - It's, I think it's also a much figured deal
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.960]   with the, when you're on the web,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.280]   anything else, 'cause the web is,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.520]   you got all kinds of text,
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.360]   and all kinds of content,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.560]   and all kinds of scales.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.840]   This is the, that's the one area in which,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.120]   like the, this device with its, like,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.680]   non-retinod display, and like the Nexus 7,
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.800]   which, or even the Kindle Fire, which is higher resolution,
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.160]   this device does look like Chrome
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.200]   on when you have a, it does look terrible
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.240]   when you're doing the web.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.040]   I do a lot more zooming for that.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.440]   So yeah, maybe if there were more web content,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.680]   especially on the 11 inch, which again,
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.960]   Jason, you're a lovable freak,
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.000]   who I like to have a bunch of very,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.920]   but it's like, oh man.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   - Bring on the 8 inch.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.240]   (laughing)
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.960]   - Just keep making it smaller, I'll go there.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.800]   - How far inch?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.120]   - How about the Apple watch?
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.840]   - Give me 14 pixels, but it's beautiful.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.200]   - It's high res.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.480]   - They're nerve in the chat room
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.720]   and actually makes a fantastic point,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.120]   which is next year, all these Macs will be running Mavericks,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.960]   which will presumably have better battery life,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.000]   which will allow Apple to claim a larger hour number,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.040]   then they claim right now.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.080]   - I'm really curious.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.800]   Now you're running Mavericks on your 13 inch MacBook Pro,
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.640]   right? - This is a Pro Retina.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.840]   Yeah, this is my review unit.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   - Oh, it's not, it's an Apple unit.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.480]   - It's from Apple, yeah.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.040]   So because it's an Apple unit, you can talk about it?
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.280]   - I can talk about it a little bit, yeah.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.920]   I mean, I'm writing stories about it,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.720]   there'll be a story up tomorrow.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.560]   - Okay.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.400]   - What do you wanna know?
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.000]   - Yeah, it looks pretty much the same.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.920]   I see the Mavericks wallpaper.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.520]   - Yeah, it's fancy.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.360]   - So it's different.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.560]   - So the story that I'm doing for tomorrow.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.840]   - First of all, iOS 7 is very, very beta.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.480]   Even beta 2 is still really rocky.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.960]   - That's my understanding.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.360]   - Yeah, I wouldn't know 'cause I haven't played with it.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.720]   - I've read articles to that effect online, yes.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.560]   - Please, you guys.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   So Mavericks, how much is it in better shape?
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.760]   How close are we?
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.920]   - I think, I've been using it for the last week
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.160]   and it's pretty solid.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.920]   There are quirks, but it's beta.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.360]   - You couldn't say that about iOS 7.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.200]   I mean, it really is.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.680]   - So my setup at work is a two monitor.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.280]   I have an external, I have a Thunderbolt display
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.040]   and then I've got a laptop.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.560]   And that's my favorite feature so far of Mavericks
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.760]   is the multiple monitor support where now you can do
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.120]   mission control, you can put a,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.960]   in Mountain Lion, if you put an app in full screen,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.720]   the other display becomes linen.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.560]   - So nice.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.000]   - And it just sits there and does nothing.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And then the two screens are completely independent.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   You can full screen on one, you can have a desktop
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.040]   on another, you can swipe.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.960]   You move your mouse onto one screen and swipe
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.680]   with a trackpad, it'll move through spaces,
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.720]   move it to the other screen swipe,
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.200]   it'll move through to spaces there.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.200]   They're completely independent of one another.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.800]   It's really nice and then you can airplay it to a TV
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.320]   using Apple TV and use it as an external display.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.080]   - How important is that?
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.360]   Are there a lot of people with multiple displays?
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   - You know, I'm surprised that Apple's doing this feature
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.160]   'cause I always figured Apple just would say
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.520]   there aren't enough people doing it.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.680]   I know a lot of people who do it, but they're more--
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   - Prose do it users.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.680]   - You know, our finance department does it,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.520]   they'll have two Excel spreadsheets open.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.920]   - I think with all the laptops out there,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.160]   if three quarters of the systems Apple sells
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.640]   somewhere between two thirds and three quarters
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.920]   are laptops, then, you know, some percentage
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   of those people do want a big display when they're at work.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.920]   And at that point, you've got two displays,
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.800]   you might as well use them if you can really make use of them.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.600]   And Apple doesn't do anything without a lot of research.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.760]   So I imagine that they did the research and said,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.560]   hey, maybe we could prioritize these multiple monitor features.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.600]   - Also, it was just annoying.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.280]   I mean, even if it's only 2% of the users,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.240]   but that's just annoying.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.160]   - It's like everyone in Cupertino is using it that way.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.240]   - Yeah, right, no, that's true.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.480]   - Yeah, so now this is great.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.640]   You can just take your calendar app
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.720]   and put it over on your small laptop screen
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.560]   and hit it--
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.880]   - Oh, really? - It's really curious.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.840]   - You gotta, Mac, world should do a poll or something
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.800]   'cause I'm really curious if people are moving
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.080]   to multiple screens.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.320]   I have a feeling it may be more than we think.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.280]   It may be less of an unusual.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.200]   How about in our audience?
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.480]   How many, one?
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.800]   And everybody in our staff, of course.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.240]   - See, that's the difference.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.200]   - It's a boss buys it, as many screens as you can get on there.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.440]   - But if the Mac is becoming more of a truck, right?
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.120]   It's more professional than the power user percentage
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.600]   might increase over time.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.200]   So it's not bad to add some power users.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.160]   - Everybody in our chat room, I mean, our chat room,
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.640]   of course, people in our chat room are a different breed.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.280]   Many of them probably have chat running in a second screen.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.360]   And maybe us as well.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.840]   But it seems like many of our chat rooms is running multiple.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.240]   - How's this for a twist though?
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.320]   I find that I was about to say
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.360]   that I almost never use a second screen,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.320]   but I had to correct myself 'cause I was talking,
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.000]   you're talking about a second display plugged into
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.880]   a monitor port on your laptop or on your desktop.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.320]   And in truth, I use a second display almost all the time.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.600]   When I have my notebook out, I almost always have my iPad
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.680]   on an easel next to it for a second,
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.480]   a totally separate app with a totally separate operating system.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.200]   Even when I write on my iPad,
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.080]   I will almost always have a second iPad or the iPad mini
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.800]   again on an easel next to it,
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.000]   because to me, that just seems like such a natural
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.480]   and easy way of multitasking.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.400]   So I don't know, that's more of an interesting story
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.720]   than a functional data point, but.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.560]   - Well, the fact that the matter is that
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.880]   the fact that multiple screens used to be the,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.800]   used to be the bees' knees, I was about to use a rude word
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.240]   that's in the vernacular, but I will say,
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.920]   it used to be the bees' knees.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.400]   Now, maybe that's just not the way the people are interacting
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.200]   with real productivity, multi-screen workflows.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.120]   - I'm willing to bet, now we only had one person
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.360]   who uses two monitors in our audience,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.080]   but I'm wondering how many of you, when you're watching TV,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.000]   have another screen open at the same time, all of you, right?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   That's the condition of the modern world.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.160]   (laughs)
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   And you can do that, you know, you can airplay
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.600]   to a big screen TV now.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.040]   - If you have an Apple TV, right?
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.120]   You have to have an Apple TV.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.880]   - Yeah, Apple TV, and then with Mavericks,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.400]   instead of it just being mirroring,
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.800]   it will be a second monitor if you want it to be.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.240]   - So I can have my Game of Thrones wiki on my laptop
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.320]   while I'm watching Game of Thrones.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.480]   - Yeah, and you can full screen it up on the TV.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.160]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.160]   - Yeah, or anything you want to put up there,
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.600]   put maps up there, put a calendar up.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.400]   - So in that sense, again, that's probably a small number
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.360]   of people who have an Apple TV and a Macintosh
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.680]   and watch TV on their big screen with their Apple TV.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.880]   But in that sense, I think we are getting used to the idea
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.800]   very much used to the idea of having multiple screens
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.640]   at the same time.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.240]   - Yeah, it's really good in businesses
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.480]   and conference room environments.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.760]   If you, I think they're going to sell more Apple TVs
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.640]   than they already have into conference rooms
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.920]   because this just makes it that much more flexible
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.360]   when you're in a presentation or sharing environment.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.000]   - I did want to ask a question,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.760]   just a poll of the panel.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.800]   How many people think that part of the reason
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.320]   why Apple decided to improve multi-screen performance
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.520]   is that they simply were offended by the fact
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.240]   they were shipping a product that had a feature
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.840]   that was this busted, that just didn't work as well
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.160]   as anybody expected to.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.000]   - I'm serious.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.680]   Well, it's got to be embarrassing.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.280]   I mean, could that have been the legendary Apple
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.600]   as opposed to the real Apple?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.960]   We can say, oh, no, no, no.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.560]   I, we will not ship this if it doesn't support multi-displays
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.880]   very, very well.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.360]   I just imagine being just annoying and annoying,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.000]   just like that broken step on your front porch
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.960]   where you can walk over it only enough time
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.640]   for you so that I know that it's intact,
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   I know that it's functional, but damn it,
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.640]   I feel like an idiot for having this broken step on my head.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   - And they ran out of linen
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.040]   and they couldn't just leave a white screen,
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.560]   so they had to put something on.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.080]   - They had plenty of leather left over
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.840]   that they were pulling off the rest of the interface.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.120]   - You think it could be as part of the death
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.440]   of skeuomorphic design?
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.800]   We have to get rid of that linen, it's driving me crazy.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.640]   - Not linen.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.720]   - The whole screen of linen, what would you have?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.520]   - The enormous wool--
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.360]   - Test pattern.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.200]   - Incredibly upset.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.680]   - An open GL picture of your face blurred in the background.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.520]   (laughing)
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.880]   - With parallax view.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.360]   (laughing)
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.920]   - A list about anything else in Mavericks
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.160]   that leaps to the eye that perhaps we didn't know about
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.520]   that you've seen as you've played with it
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.360]   over the last week, Jason.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.920]   - I still gotta spend some more time with it.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   I mean, it feels faster, I actually use Apple Mail,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.280]   I stopped for a while and I went back to it with Mount Lion
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.000]   and it's much faster even in the beta on,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.480]   I don't know what they did, but it's much faster.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.400]   And then, there's obviously a lot of concern
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.840]   put toward energy use here and I don't have enough data
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.000]   to say it's definitely using less battery than before,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.840]   but under the battery dropdown, it tells you
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.440]   what apps are consuming power,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.320]   which is a really kind of nerdy thing
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   that I think Apple would never have talked about before,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.400]   but it's in there and you can actually from there
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.720]   open the activity monitor app, which I've always used
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.960]   and has always been one of my favorites, but--
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.680]   - You know what's funny is that all Android phones do that
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.600]   and you get used to it, iPhone has never done that
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.720]   and I wish it would and the fact that doing it on the desk
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.560]   that maybe they'll put it in iOS.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.880]   - And they added this feature.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.760]   - And an activity monitor, in addition to your CPU usage
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.840]   and your network usage and your memory usage--
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.680]   - It's just power usage.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.040]   - It has a power usage meter that will show you
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.560]   which apps are using power, even historically,
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.840]   like how much power over the last half hour
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.040]   or hour these different apps.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.360]   So if you're really having trouble,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.920]   you know what apps are the culprits.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.200]   - Is it just another tab on the activity monitor?
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.760]   - It's just another tab in activity monitor.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.680]   - Such a nice thing.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.240]   - So whether this actually amounts to much,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.720]   I can't say yet, but definitely it seems like
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.080]   that was a big area of interest for Apple
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.920]   and Mavericks was to try and add more power sense,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.720]   which ideally would make that MacBook Air
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.640]   that has so such a big battery already
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.400]   work even better if it really works.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.280]   - And you got actionable notifications,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.400]   which I also want to know on iOS.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.040]   - I have a bunch of friends who hate iMessage
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.400]   for good reasons 'cause it's really,
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.160]   messages is really kind of buggy.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.920]   And the nice thing about this is they never need
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.880]   to open messages whenever they get an iMessage,
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.560]   it comes in as a bubble notification
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.480]   and you click reply and type something
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.320]   and you never actually go into it.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.160]   - That's really nice.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.080]   - So jealous, yeah, that's nice.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.920]   - So will I be able to go into this sidebar,
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.800]   the notification sidebar and action there?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.480]   Or do I have to see a pop-up bubble to do that?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.800]   - I don't know.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.080]   - 'Cause we've got actions here,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.060]   click to tweet or click to post.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.640]   - Yes, you can.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   - There's the answer.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.800]   - Yeah, you can just send an iMessage from within.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.360]   - Look at that, I love it.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.320]   So there's, I gotta say, Apple sometimes has a reputation
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.760]   of being this mysterious monolithic company
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.640]   that doesn't really listen to what users complain about
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.600]   and just goes their own way.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.040]   But every one of these OS 10 releases
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.640]   that they've been doing the last few years
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.920]   has knocked off an awful lot of complaints
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.000]   off of the complaint list.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.600]   And I like that, that means they are either they're listening
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.640]   or they are Mac users just like us
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   and they hate the same things that we do
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   when they wanna fix them.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.280]   But either way, it's good for Mac users to get those updates.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.920]   - But the irony is they do listen on the desktop
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.160]   a lot more than they listen on the phone.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.000]   - That may be.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.880]   - We don't have actionable notifications on the phone yet either.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.720]   - That may be.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.560]   - Yeah.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.400]   - Or the list is just longer, Leo.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.080]   There's so many more things I have to get to.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.160]   And OS 10 is mature enough that they can start knocking
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.200]   off those little things where iOS is still redo interface,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.600]   checkbox, actionable locations, next time.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.880]   - Let's, we'll save iOS for the next segment.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.320]   But first let's talk a little bit about smile software.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.880]   By the way, I should mention our good friend,
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.440]   G. MacDonald, who's a partner at Smile.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   Her app camp for girls opened yesterday.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.320]   I think it's such a great idea.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.080]   They're bringing in to encourage girls
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.520]   to get involved in computer science.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.960]   She's got app camp for girls.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.360]   I didn't pay for an after that, but I'm gonna mention it anyway.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   - I donated.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.120]   - Did you?
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.040]   Was it a Kickstarter?
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.880]   - Yep.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.720]   - Okay, I think so.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.560]   - Or Andy Gogo.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.640]   - Andy Gogo, something like that.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.880]   - Yeah, I was a crowd fan.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.720]   - Yeah, so this was a good.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.560]   - My daughter was a good man.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   I would love for her to do something like that next summer.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.400]   That'd be great.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.440]   - So cool.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.920]   Well, it just kicked off.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.920]   Find out more at appcamp, the number four girls.com.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.400]   And while you're at it,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.080]   you might wanna support smile software
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.320]   'cause they do such great stuff,
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.040]   including the brand new PDF pen six,
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   all-purpose PDF editing tool from Smile Software.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.440]   If you work with PDFs, you might be tempted to say,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.480]   well, I've got preview, I don't need to do anything
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.320]   anymore.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.480]   I use PDFs.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.960]   My son's going to college in the fall.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.560]   Lots of forms to fill out.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.680]   Having PDF pen is so fabulous
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.640]   because I can download the PDF.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.040]   I don't have to print it, fill it out,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   scan it, and fax it.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.520]   I can edit it right in the PDF with PDF pen.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.280]   Makes it so easy to add things like signatures
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.120]   to fill out forms, sign contracts.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.960]   I don't have to print.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.800]   I don't have to fax.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.240]   I can just do it right on the original,
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   the quality's better.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.440]   And with PDF pen for the iPad and PDF pen for the iPhone,
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.240]   you can go back and forth seamlessly,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.200]   which is awfully nice too.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.840]   If you're a Mac break listener,
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   we've got a special deal for you at smilesoftware.com/macbreak
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.480]   of free demo for you.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.760]   These are on the App Store,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.240]   but you have to do a demo on a website, right?
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.280]   So if you wanna do the free trial,
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   try it right there, smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.200]   Export to Word, one of the new features, that's nice.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.440]   You can export it out to a Word.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.760]   Still, people still send me Word documents to fill out.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.840]   I don't understand that.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.040]   That's just nuts.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.320]   That's just crazy talk.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.720]   - There are parts of the world where Word is a still a thing.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.840]   - Not my world.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.640]   But thank goodness I have PDF pen
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.720]   and I'm able to export right out to the Microsoft Word
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.080]   and make them happy.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.520]   New tools, new interface, new features,
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.120]   add text images and signatures
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.000]   to keep them all in your library for easy access,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.880]   make changes, fix typos, resize,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.000]   and delete images right in the PDF.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.840]   You gotta like that.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.400]   There's the App Store version.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.280]   Fill out forms, that's the thing I use all the time.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.600]   You can even OCR scanned documents.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.300]   But, look at that.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.320]   Back when I had to do taxes, that's how I did it.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.200]   PDF pen, version six is out.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.120]   Try it for free.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.600]   If free demo awaits you at smilesoftware.com/macbreak.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.760]   We thank them for their support.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.920]   And thank you Jean and good luck with App Camp for girls.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.680]   I gave them extra little plug in there just for that.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.880]   They, it was Indiegogo.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.520]   Yeah, they raised $50,000 in three days.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.080]   They got to their stretch goal.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.360]   It's in Portland this year
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.160]   and I hope that they can do more.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.920]   Even more next year, that's really cool.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.840]   All right, iOS 7, can't show it to you.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.280]   Won't show it to you.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   But there are people who have copies
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.560]   they're willing to show you, including,
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.320]   who was this nine to five Mac?
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.840]   Shall we, can I show there?
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.280]   Would anybody be offended?
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.520]   You showed, I wouldn't be offended if you showed nine to five Mac.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.720]   We don't judge Leo.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.200]   Yes, you do.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.000]   You're judging me, you're judging me.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.200]   So beta two came out for the iPhone
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.400]   and when beta two came out, so did iPad versions.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.360]   They've got the first iPad look.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   It doesn't look, it looks like it's the same OS on an iPad, right?
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.200]   I don't know what you're saying.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.320]   It's Russian apparently.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.440]   I don't know what that is.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   My first reaction is that it's possible
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.000]   that the iPhone 5 is not the device
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.360]   that was designed to run on.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.200]   Ah.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.920]   That they were real, that,
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.720]   I mean, not that it doesn't run perfectly fine
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.400]   but that perhaps they are already thinking ahead to,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.520]   the best target for this is going to be the iPad mini.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.560]   It's got the pair of ones.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.400]   Look at that.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.000]   And next year there's going to be a,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.680]   well, excuse me, we all have to assume
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.760]   there's going to be a larger screen iPhone.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.560]   So that when I was looking at these videos
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.000]   and these screenshots myself, I was thinking,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.280]   God, it looks a lot prettier on a larger screen
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.160]   than it does on the current scale iPhones.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.080]   And maybe that's part of their thinking.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.960]   - Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.400]   I hadn't really, that didn't come to me.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.240]   That's interesting.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.080]   - Yeah, a lot of people have been speculating
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.440]   and talking about that this is an operating system design,
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.960]   you know, maybe for current hardware,
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.360]   but also for hardware that's in the pipeline
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.200]   because Apple said, you know,
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.000]   this is a platform that's going to take them.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.120]   One does not simply make an OpenGL physics engine
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.760]   and particle engine for current products.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.200]   This is a long standing commitment to human interface.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   And I agree with Andy, it looks very well designed
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.360]   for an iPad.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.040]   - Big change to the multitasking on the iPad.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.120]   They're doing that same card thing
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.360]   that they're doing on the iPhone.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.160]   And I have to say on the iPad, it does make a lot more sense.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.320]   - With all those detailed previews.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.480]   - They see the preview.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.000]   - They don't just hint at what's there.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.560]   It says, "No, here's exactly."
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.680]   Even if you just want to use that as a dashboard
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.360]   just to give a status look at everything that's going on.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   - Well, and the iPad really needed it
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.960]   because the icons, just showing the icon.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.800]   And it wasn't even clear
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.200]   that something was running or not.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.120]   It was just an icon.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.280]   - Keep in mind, I mean, the iPad came out after the iPhone
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.520]   and the iPhone OS was originally what it was.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.280]   And when they added the iPad,
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.200]   it's a lot of the fundamental things
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.960]   about the iOS interface were kind of set
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.440]   and they made it work.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.360]   But I think this is the first chance for them
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.880]   to really redesign the iOS interface with the iPad in mind.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.680]   And so it's encouraging when you see something like this.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.960]   - It is encouraging, but let's also acknowledge
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.520]   that if Apple did not believe that this had worked,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.960]   they would have made a tweak to it for the iPad.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.760]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.360]   - We wouldn't have had to wait this long.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.920]   So I do think that Apple kind of sat in their hands
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.760]   a little bit too long,
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.240]   giving an application switch
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.480]   and some other things that really could have been improved
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.320]   before now.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   - Oh yeah, it certainly could have.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.120]   I think that this was finally,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   we're here, we're seeing them be able to do that.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.200]   They could have tried to do a rethink earlier
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.800]   and who knows, Scott Forstall maybe.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.400]   But now they are.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.240]   And I think that's good.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.800]   'Cause the iPad, I mean, that was the knock on the iPad
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.080]   and it was silly to say it was just a big iPhone.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.120]   But I always felt with the home screen,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.560]   especially that that was fair criticism
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.400]   of the home screen.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.880]   The apps not so much, but the home screen,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.560]   it was, what do we do with all that space?
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.400]   So I don't know.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.760]   So now we've seen them.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.840]   - There's a famous story.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.120]   There's a famous story from Greg Jazuak
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.400]   when they said, "Why is there no cutting paste
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.480]   on the iPhone still?"
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.720]   And he said, "Well, it's on the list.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.680]   There's just other things above it."
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.640]   And it finally got to the list for iOS three, I think it was.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.120]   And this, I mean, they had other ideas
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.400]   for multitasking before.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   There were prototype iPhones found with Exposay on them.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.320]   That Apple ditched and said,
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.080]   "No, we're gonna do the fast app switcher instead."
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.000]   So they've always been playing and experimenting with it.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.840]   And I think when they moved to the object-oriented
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.040]   interface where everything is like a plane
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.360]   that they can actually manipulate
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.120]   and has direct manipulation as gesture actions,
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.160]   it makes a lot of sense to start going towards these metaphors.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.720]   Is there not all the animation?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.360]   My understanding is that it's no longer key frame animated.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.760]   It's real physics and it will bounce and collide
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.800]   and move around.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.360]   And that lets you start rethinking all these basic ideas
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.360]   about interface.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.160]   - There's a lot of white.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.560]   You know, if this iOS 7 was really designed
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.280]   for the iPad, do you think Apple's starting to think
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.960]   that the iPad is its most important product?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.520]   More so than the iPhone, let's say.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.160]   - Oh, I wouldn't say that.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.320]   - I would say it's maybe designed for larger screen devices
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.480]   as well as smaller screen devices in a way
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.800]   that the iOS was designed for the one size.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.480]   So now you've got an iPad and an iPad Mini
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.040]   and maybe you'll have a larger iPhone coming down the pipe.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.040]   And now it's got room to take advantage of those bigger spaces
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.360]   and stretch out in maybe a way that the original iOS wasn't.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.200]   - Okay.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.600]   - And although there's no bigger fan
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.680]   of the big sized iPad than I am,
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.720]   I think that Apple is going to start looking
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.000]   at the popularity of the iPad Mini
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.840]   and thinking that that is now going to be the default iPad
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.480]   and that's what we have to design.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.800]   We will never design iOS around a single device,
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.240]   but it's not a funny.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.840]   The central experience has to be,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.000]   this has to look absolutely fan frickin'
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.560]   task-stick on the iPad Mini.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.320]   And if it looks a little bit wrong on the full-sized iPad,
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.160]   that's okay.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.600]   Just like right now, it was okay that the iOS looks
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.320]   a little bit wrong on the Mini,
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   but that's not gonna be true next year.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.360]   - Ironic that's 'cause Steve said,
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.000]   "Well, never do a seven inch, seven inches wrong."
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.480]   And it turns out maybe that's a sweet spot
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.320]   for everything Apple.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.120]   - They will never do a video on an iPhone.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.840]   - Yeah, yeah, no, don't make a phone.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.440]   - If you imagine, I mean, Andy's exactly right,
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.640]   that you may end up with a scenario where everything's
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.480]   a little too cramped on the iPhone,
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.440]   but there's the bigger iPhone where it feels okay.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.840]   And then the iPad Mini, it feels okay.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.200]   And then everything's a little too spaced out
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.520]   on the big iPad.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.280]   And that may be where we end up.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.440]   That Apple is sort of shooting for that middle ground
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   and wants everything to scale a lot more
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.720]   than iOS was built to do originally.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.160]   - I wish that it would be,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.200]   what I'm interested in finding out is,
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.320]   what was the thing that kind of broke people
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.760]   for the iPad Mini?
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.840]   Because you can make the argument that it was really
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.480]   the price because it's,
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.920]   you can sort of justify $320 as well.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.360]   This is a consumer item,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.680]   rest at the $500 price point,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.280]   you're talking about a very specific kind of,
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.160]   a more specific kind of consumer.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.800]   Or was it the simple fact that,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.320]   I mean, this is something that you can really manage.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.480]   You can toss it in bags,
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.080]   you can be untossing into back pockets
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.320]   for a sufficiently large pocket.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.160]   It's, I think it's one of those two.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   I, it was not something that anybody was gonna figure out
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.120]   until the original iPad was released.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.880]   But I think that all the data is saying that
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.040]   what people want is a smaller screen.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.880]   - I think to end, I switched to the iPad Mini
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.160]   and I have never gotten back to the size.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.000]   - I love the Mini.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.960]   Except it needs to be read.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.640]   - And reading comics makes me sad on it because it's too small.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.480]   - It's too small.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.880]   - I still use the full size for comics.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:52.720]   It's the only thing I use it for
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.280]   is comics and occasional TV show.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.760]   But I think to Andy's earlier point too,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.680]   they showed off a lot of really,
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.560]   like they basically rebuilt the whole type engine
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.000]   and they were showing that off on stage,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.720]   the different things that they can do with typography
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.080]   on the iPad and that makes sense
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.920]   when you start having multiple screen sizes
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.680]   to have type that's not just scaled,
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.320]   but it's actually specifically defined for each of those sizes.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.080]   And you know, my eyes are not getting any better.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.560]   So I really appreciate the stuff
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.600]   that they're doing because on iOS 6 on the iPhone 5,
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.760]   it was getting really teeny tiny.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.720]   - Maybe that's why I want Retina so bad,
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.720]   but more than you guys 'cause I'm old.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.560]   - That's possible.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.400]   - Yeah.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.240]   - I just, and I think,
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.080]   - Sure.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.920]   - You will see.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.160]   - I'm the old.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.000]   - Thank you.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.080]   - You want a version of artwork that ships on cassette tapes.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.920]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.760]   - That's enough.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.040]   - In a baggie, when will we see a Retina?
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.160]   We'll see a Retina Mini this year.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.000]   - Yeah.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.840]   - I don't know.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.680]   I hope so.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.520]   - No.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.200]   - It's tough to get that, you know,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.400]   see what happened to the iPad when they put Retina in it.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.600]   It got so much thicker.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.440]   - And slower.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.640]   - It got heavier and it slowed down a little
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.280]   because they had to have all that video processing in it
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.000]   because there's so many dots, so many pixels.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.320]   - iPad 3 is the worst iPad in the lot.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.640]   I mean, any game developer will tell you
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.320]   it's the absolute worst iPad they've ever built.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.680]   - Yeah.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.560]   And you're gonna need a lot of performance.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.840]   You're gonna have that particle engine
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   and the physics engine and all that stuff too, right?
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.960]   I mean, is that true Renee that?
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   - It's GPI, so my understanding is that they're,
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.480]   of course they're making the thinner iPad Maxi
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.880]   and they're making the Retina iPad Mini,
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   but it's a gamble with battery life
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.440]   and is Apple's not gonna ship a Retina iPad Mini
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.760]   that gets five hours battery life.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.880]   So as soon as they can hit 10 hours battery life
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.160]   and they have a launch window,
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.280]   like the fall or the spring,
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.880]   that product will go into cycle.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.320]   But whether that, you know, if they'd done it earlier,
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.240]   we would have had it earlier.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.760]   If they can do it for fall, maybe we'll get it in the fall.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   - There's no sign that the iPad Mini is not selling well,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.600]   right?
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.440]   - Right, I was trying.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.840]   - I was able to go through the holidays this year
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.560]   with a smaller update and bring Retina on
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.040]   for more price 'cause it's gonna cost more
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.480]   and it might have worse battery life.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.600]   Maybe they wait until the spring for that.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.800]   - We got a bunch of graphics guys together
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.480]   for the An Iterate podcast.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.320]   And one of them was Lauren Richter who does letterpress
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.640]   and he said, "As a graphics engineer,
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.000]   looking at iOS 7 makes him cry
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.800]   because basically that is just running off the GPU.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.720]   They got blur shaders all the time
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.400]   and it's incredibly expensive.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.840]   But I think once that becomes a new table stakes
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.400]   and then the future chips comes out,
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.160]   that's just something the operating system does
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.320]   and the whole next generation of apps
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.280]   gets built on that platform and then it gets really exciting.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.120]   - I would guess none of Lauren's apps use GPUs.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:23.960]   They're very--
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.040]   - Lauren rewrote--
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.000]   - No, he rewrote UIKit in Open GL to make letterpress.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.520]   - Reel is not normal.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   - No.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.200]   (laughing)
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.120]   - And he did that 'cause he wasn't happy with the way it was--
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.360]   - He wanted it the way he wanted it.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.920]   I mean, his original job was at Apple building the GL stack
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.760]   for the first iPhone.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.600]   - So he could make it better.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.880]   - Yeah, and for Tweety, he was rendering text
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.920]   to a frame buffer to make it move really, really fast.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.320]   So for letterpress, it is a complete Open GL interface.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.320]   - Wow.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.160]   - You see that a lot.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.760]   You see there's a lot of iOS apps where you find out,
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.560]   wow, this is the one of the best camera apps ever.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.400]   How did you do that?
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.240]   And the developers as well,
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.640]   I basically wrote my own interface kit
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.480]   and wow, you're right,
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   word processor works for you.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.320]   How did you do that?
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.120]   Well, I wrote my own text kit where I wrote my own cloud.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.080]   - That's not a good thing.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.440]   - Well, you don't have to know.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.560]   - It's adequate for most people
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.440]   for if you have a vision of an app
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.520]   that requires something else,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.440]   you're free to be more clever.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.360]   But like Renee said,
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.480]   a lot of that stuff has really been addressed.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.560]   I feel sorry for these people who are creating
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.960]   next generation word processors,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.160]   where they've sort of given up on the text engine
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.000]   that's built in.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.640]   And now they've got something coming up that's,
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.760]   oh, this is better.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.200]   And now that, and now when Jason Snell's daughter
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.000]   comes out of camp,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.600]   she can actually write a better word process
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.480]   with the one that I've been working on
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.600]   for the past 11 months.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   - It's seen for me though,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.400]   the early days of the Mac,
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.280]   what was one of the selling points of the Mac
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   was how good the Romerteens were,
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.840]   how good the API was.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.720]   - Well, I think the APIs are good,
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   but when you're in an app universe
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   with a half a million apps.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.560]   - You gotta be the best.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.960]   - If you wanna stand out from the crowd
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.520]   and do something that not everybody else is doing,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.440]   this is where you go.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.320]   And it's amazing that they actually can go there.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.240]   And so they do.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.360]   But you see that a lot, that the ones,
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.520]   it's not all of them.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.320]   It's the 10 or 20 that we talk about.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.160]   They're like, wow, they do something
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.000]   I've never seen before.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.840]   - There's something magic going on.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.360]   - It's not, you know, not using the stock stuff.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.000]   They're using custom, a lot of custom.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.440]   - So you must, so I poo-pooed this article
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.720]   in Polygon by Tracy Leanne,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.160]   the Apple obstacle for serious games,
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.040]   making a serious game for iOS devices
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.720]   is not as easy as you'd think.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.040]   You'd agree with that, it sounds like.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.120]   I mean, it-
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.560]   - Yeah, although I'd say the biggest problem
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.800]   to making a serious quote unquote serious game,
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.880]   and let's be clear, serious games don't sell
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.400]   as well as not serious games do.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.080]   But I think the touch interface,
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.600]   Apple is not gonna put hardware buttons on an iOS device.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.440]   - And they shouldn't.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.240]   - And they shouldn't, but serious games really,
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.800]   at this point, as they've been conceived,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.640]   all require like controllers or something
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.880]   that they're just not gonna provide.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.280]   - I think that's lazy, if you look,
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.200]   but we're seeing support for that now.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.040]   - Yeah.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.120]   - If you're porting a game that was on a PC
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.800]   or a console to the iPad, maybe that's lazy.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   Maybe you should write something
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.960]   that is designed for the touch interface.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.400]   There are games, you know, angry birds,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.200]   plants versus zombies that use the touch interface so well.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.360]   Fruit Ninja.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.200]   - If you see a D button on the screen, they blow it.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.120]   - I hate that.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.960]   - Yeah.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.760]   - When I look at that, I go, I'm not gonna buy that game.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.600]   Yeah, I sure would love to play Grand Theft Auto
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.080]   or Call of Duty on the iPad, maybe.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.760]   But those games require very complex controls,
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.520]   and it's just not suited to touch.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.360]   One of the, go ahead.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.200]   - So I was gonna say, one of the things
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.840]   that was the best, one of the best reactions I saw
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.680]   from WWDC was from a lot of developers
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.760]   who were so happy that they could go home now
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.160]   and throw away a bunch of code
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.800]   that it had to custom write.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.760]   Because, you know, before, and they'll tell you this,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.120]   it took forever to get four custom physics movements
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.000]   going on their app, and now they can pretty much
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.520]   do anything that they dream.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.760]   It took forever to get, you know,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.360]   they just couldn't use a game controller.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.560]   Now with iOS 7, you'll be able to pick up
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.680]   a Bluetooth game controller and use that,
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.440]   and they're gonna have so many opportunities.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.680]   When you look at what Apple's done,
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.760]   and it's not fair 'cause Apple has special tools
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.280]   to make all this stuff, but developers will figure that out.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.440]   And when you look at all the kinds of interactions
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.960]   and objects that iOS 7 is moving around,
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.400]   the next generation of apps and games a year from now,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.960]   they're getting all that stuff for free.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.480]   They can now spend their cycles on making stuff fantastic,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.120]   not just making it move anymore.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.480]   - And actually, Tracy's saying that the other issue
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.080]   is simply getting through the app store.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.560]   You know, that you can't be guaranteed.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.640]   You're gonna, you could spend years running a game
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.040]   and then say they get rejected, which would be pretty bad.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.000]   - Although lots of developers do talk to Apple
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.160]   and advance and say, okay, we wanna do this.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.280]   Is this gonna be a problem?
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.480]   That actually does happen.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.760]   And so it's not quite as bad as that,
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.000]   but it's true if they just decide
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   they don't wanna, you're app in the store, they'll reject it,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.480]   but that doesn't, we don't hear about that a lot.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.400]   There's, it doesn't have very often.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.240]   - Plus, plus, plus, plus.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.800]   - And the ones that rejected were kind of obvious.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.560]   - Okay, here's one.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.160]   Endgame Syria, it's a card game.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.280]   Players explore the politics and military side
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.440]   of the conflict in Syria by deciding which political path
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.240]   to choose which military units to deploy.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.600]   Apple rejected it, saying the app contained content
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.240]   or features that include people from a specific race,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.760]   culture, government, corporation, or other real entity
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.840]   as enemies in the context of the game,
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   which is not in compliance.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.720]   So you can't have an enemy that's a real person.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.960]   - Like Disneyland Leo.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.640]   - Now they probably should have known that, right?
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.760]   It's hard to make a game called Endgame Syria
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.560]   that doesn't do that, so I think they probably
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.720]   had to walk away, right?
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.680]   - Yeah, I mean, there are only two bad things about this.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.600]   I agree with Jason that it was scary and a lot very damaging,
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.960]   I think, when the app store first opened,
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.880]   when there weren't a whole lot of protocols
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.040]   inside of Apple for dealing with bad results.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.600]   And also developers had not really figured out
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.960]   exactly how the system works.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   Now, it's rare that I hear about a developer
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.400]   who just got shut down by Apple,
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.360]   and either A, had no idea that it was coming,
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.600]   or B, after it came, didn't get any help
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.440]   on how to fix, or excuse me, quote, fix, unquote, the app.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.280]   The only thing that's gonna be hard to absolutely eliminate
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.440]   is apps, there are people who believe that games
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.920]   are a true art form and a true means of social expression.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.720]   And so the only thing that concerns me is that,
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.160]   that means that if you do wanna do something
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.880]   that addresses a controversial topic,
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.520]   you will not want to target iOS because you don't know
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.640]   if you will be able to get this game into the app store.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.080]   And okay, fine, really sit on the web,
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.760]   but that's really the only downside that I see
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.760]   to Apple for the process right now.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.200]   - So what Endgame Syria did is they released it on Android,
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.800]   and then they changed it to Endgame Eurasia for iOS,
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.440]   and they replaced the Hezbollah
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.400]   with a militant group, Palestinians became refugees.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   Apple also turned down this game, sweatshop HD,
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.960]   because Apple was uncomfortable
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.480]   with the recreation of a sweatshop.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.480]   Wonder why?
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.400]   - You know, you pull the tail of the tiger,
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   and then you complain, and when you get bit.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.240]   - Oh, no, no.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.880]   - So Tracy Leanne's article on Polygon.com,
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.240]   probably worth reading.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.880]   It's mostly about rejection,
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.400]   not about the issue of how hard it is to write these games.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.520]   - People about rejection, how support.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.480]   (laughs)
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.840]   - It's too bad, 'cause I do feel that games are an art form.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.440]   Fortunately, there are many platforms,
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.520]   but I don't see why people who use iOS
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.560]   should somehow be discriminated against
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.040]   from getting the true creative games,
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.680]   because Apple says, "Well, I think you should do it."
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.720]   On the other hand, it does make it a bit,
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.400]   it makes the App Store and the Game Store
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.000]   as a whole a better product for consumers.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   - I'm not sure that's true, Andy.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.560]   - It's not the case.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.720]   It's better in what way, but it's boundalized.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.000]   It's better 'cause it's unoffensive.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.400]   - I mean, for general consumers,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.480]   that's a very, very small percentage of the market.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.720]   People who, like, offensive content and content
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.480]   that people would not want to see,
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.280]   or people that would not want to see a game,
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.240]   I don't wanna even, I don't wanna bring the conversation down
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.160]   by citing examples of stuff that,
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.680]   but let's just say that you were a celebrity TV chef
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.040]   and had a game that expressed a thought that you had.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.800]   No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just saying.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.520]   - I think hate racism, homophobia, probably.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.880]   I guess I can understand why you'd wanna ban that,
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.400]   although-- - Given that, I mean,
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.200]   I'm just saying that given that,
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.720]   my position is usually that Apple,
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.880]   or the Apple is the company that has to take the heat
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.160]   for it not being a completely open company,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160]   excepting just about anything.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.360]   So on that basis, if they're gonna be,
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.840]   allow themselves to be, to take that heat of,
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.480]   no, we're not a store where we will allow expression
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.160]   of any thought, idea, or concept.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.280]   We will, we will police and we will curate
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.640]   to create standards that we think that our community
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.760]   would like, that's not a bad thing for most people,
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.840]   it's a bad thing for some people,
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.800]   and for those people there is Android and there's the web.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.480]   - It's the Walmart approach.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.040]   - Ah, no, that's, okay, take that back.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.080]   (laughing)
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.240]   - Well, it is a gated community.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.080]   Somebody in the chatroom said,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:52.920]   I think this is appropriate,
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.880]   if you live in a gated community,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.280]   you can't complain that they don't let the bad people in.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.200]   I would just submit that sometimes the bad people
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.800]   are the creative, interesting--
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.280]   - Every filter gets clogged.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.880]   Remember, every filter gets clogged, I like it.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.720]   I like it.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.880]   - Apple has come a long way here too.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.960]   We hear about this lesson less as things go along.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.720]   Some of that is people giving up, I suppose,
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.000]   but also Apple allows stuff in that if you compare it
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.040]   to three or four years ago,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.360]   that they've opened up a little bit.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.400]   - They said it was a bunch of humans running it,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.520]   and they were gonna make a lot of mistakes,
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520]   and they didn't anticipate every clause,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.760]   and they're trying, I mean, they're good people,
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.360]   they're trying to learn and figure it out too.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.040]   And there's still individual mistakes that happen.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.880]   I can't tell you how many times I hear about somebody
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.360]   whose app gets rejected,
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.920]   and then I talk to them a week or two later,
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.800]   and they said, "Oh yeah, I appealed it."
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.120]   Their boss looked at it and said that that was totally wrong,
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.600]   and that they should have accepted it.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.480]   So the mistakes still happen, people tend not to freak out
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.880]   about them so much.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.760]   - There's an appeal.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.520]   By the way, if your kid's bought at something in an app,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.720]   that you didn't like, you can get a $5 credit.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.240]   (laughs)
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.080]   Apple, I got the email, you probably did too,
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.960]   if you're an iTunes user, a $100 million settlement,
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.600]   to the Apple in app purchase litigation administrator
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.440]   sent out of the email,
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.480]   so look for that in your spam filters.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.080]   Those are the charges under $30,
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.640]   where we'll see the $5 iTunes gift card,
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.760]   cash refunds will be distributed to those
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.440]   with bills exceeding that amount.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.680]   If your iTunes account was charged for an in-app purchase
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.480]   made by a miner in a game app
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.800]   without your knowledge or permission,
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.000]   now they've changed it,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.440]   and you really can't claim that anymore,
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.040]   but in the early days,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.200]   it was completely possible.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.480]   People found very large iTunes bills for beautiful fish.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.880]   - Now my kids walk over to me every two minutes saying,
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.080]   "Put in the password, put in the password, put in the password."
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.160]   Leo had to authorize every one of those donuts.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.240]   (laughs)
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.280]   - Yeah, it's good to be the king.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.800]   - Let's see.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.120]   HBO and a couple other things on Apple TV got the update.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:04.960]   - Yeah.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.800]   - HBO goes nice.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800]   - Yeah, ESPN apps,
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.640]   much more stuff.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.240]   - Crackle fish crunchy roll, crunchy roll, something like that.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.080]   It's anime, right?
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.920]   - Yeah.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.120]   - I want all your American television.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.080]   Please give it to me.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.920]   (laughs)
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.760]   - I guess Apple is not gonna ever open up an app store
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.600]   for Apple TV,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.160]   so this is in the interim.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.800]   It's nice to see these additions happening.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.680]   There's still,
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.760]   the one that I still miss here is Amazon Instant Video.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.960]   I wish that was on the Apple TV.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.520]   I understand maybe why it's not there,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.600]   but it's on my iPad.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.440]   I'd really like--
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.280]   - It's a direct competitor to the iTunes store.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.120]   That's why.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.680]   - It is, and it isn't because part of Amazon--
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.520]   - It's free.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.920]   - It is Netflix, and Netflix is on there.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.640]   It's essentially, for prime members,
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.920]   it's a streaming service,
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.440]   and Netflix is on the Apple TV.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.920]   So it wouldn't surprise me if it shows up eventually,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.840]   but that's the one piece that's missing.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.080]   - It's a channel partnership play,
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.160]   so they have negotiations with all these parties,
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.600]   and I think some of them are just more onerous than others.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.040]   - Where you can buy a Roku?
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.080]   - Yeah, you can.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:00.920]   I have one of you--
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.760]   - But if you have a,
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.120]   amazingly, if you have a Roku, you don't get YouTube.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.160]   I mean, one of the most popular
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.000]   in the most important channels,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.480]   my Apple TV is YouTube.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.880]   - Or AirPlay.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.960]   Yeah, and AirPlay makes a difference.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.760]   - AirPlay, YouTube, and the iTunes store,
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.920]   those are the big differences right there.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.960]   - I think, I'm gonna start, I mean,
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.280]   when Mavericks come out, comes out,
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.680]   I'm gonna be recommending Apple TVs
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.160]   as a standard accessory, not just for content,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.840]   but just for, right, just for whatever you've got
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.040]   on your screen, drag the window into the TV,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.880]   and now you're watching that on the big TV.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.720]   - Wow.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.160]   - And it's still amazing that everyone now makes apps for Apple.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.240]   Even Blackberry's making VBM for Apple.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.120]   Google makes all their apps,
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.200]   Microsoft makes all their apps,
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.640]   there's Netflix, there's YouTube.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.360]   Apple makes nothing for nobody.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.920]   There's no iTunes store app on any other platform at all, ever.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.160]   - Safari is dead for Windows.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.840]   - Yeah, so, which is interesting,
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.120]   because if you have, a lot of people now
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.560]   have multiple device families,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.400]   like maybe you have an Android phone and an iPad,
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.440]   or an Apple TV and a Windows phone,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.200]   and you can only use your iTunes stuff conveniently
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.440]   on the Apple platform.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.920]   And I know they run it at, you know,
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.200]   subsistence level just to sell more hardware,
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.400]   but you have to wonder if one day
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.520]   that becomes sort of a cross-platform thing,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.800]   the way everything else in the market is moving.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.680]   - I wonder if that's gonna bite them in the butt someday too,
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.880]   'cause I really cannot ever recommend anybody
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.480]   buy anything on iTunes video on the TV or movie store,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.680]   because you're gonna be locked into the Apple logo
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.360]   for the life of that content.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.280]   Whereas if you go through Amazon,
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.040]   you're still gonna be locked into DRM,
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.440]   but at least you have multi-platform support.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.400]   What the smart thing to do is buy the DVD
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.360]   or the Blu-ray and rip it,
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.280]   but if you have to buy it online,
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.400]   I mean, I just don't see any reason
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.120]   to buy something from Apple,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.480]   if you're gonna be, you're just never gonna have access
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.440]   to that $20 piece of entertainment,
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.600]   unless you're always with an Apple logo on it.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.760]   - That's why I buy all my books on Kindle.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.360]   Same, exact same reason, 'cause it's everywhere.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.480]   And everywhere is better than only some places.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.840]   - It's locked, but it's locked and that's no good,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.640]   but Amazon is at least willing to say,
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.000]   okay, name a device.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.640]   Okay, we got an app for that.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.240]   I'm gonna make up a device that doesn't exist.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   That's okay, give us the API,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.880]   we will write a version for you.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.080]   - I have a fragment to strategy.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.840]   I go to Kindle first, but a lot of the titles
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.000]   are either US only or just simply not available,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.320]   and then I have to go to iBooks and get them.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.000]   So now I have stuff everywhere,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.720]   I have to try to remember which app has which thing
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.960]   I wanna read.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.400]   - Oh, isn't it horrible living in a country
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.240]   with universal healthcare?
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.720]   (laughing)
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.320]   - Medical care, not healthcare, we get no free massages, sir.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.160]   - What?
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.000]   (laughing)
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   - It's criminal.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.360]   - I'll give you some addresses in Newton.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.200]   You'll feel better.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.280]   (laughing)
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.880]   - Okay, so a show of hands,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.920]   when you turn on your iOS mobile hotspot on your iPhone,
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.400]   do you just accept the password
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.960]   that it offers you and tell your friends, use this, don't?
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.200]   According to a report from a computer science researchers
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.720]   at the University of Erlingen in Germany,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.040]   the report is very dramatically named,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.080]   usability versus security is the everlasting trade off
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.680]   in the context of Apple iOS mobile hotspots.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.240]   - In German, that's one word.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.080]   (laughing)
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:51.920]   - One word.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.240]   Apparently Apple got the,
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.400]   so it generates these kind of
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.400]   easy to remember English language looking passwords.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.560]   Apparently it uses a word list
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.520]   from an open source Scrabble game.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.680]   52,000 words in it,
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.200]   but it doesn't even use all 52,000 words.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.960]   Apparently a subset,
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.200]   only 1,842 different entries of the dictionary are used,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.240]   which means they can brute force it in about 60 seconds.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.560]   So, just a tip.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.600]   Don't use that. - It's very easy
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.200]   to set your own password.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.840]   - Yeah, and just, you know, even if it were just like,
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.720]   bla bla bla, just set it.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.640]   - Apple's probably aware of this and probably fixing it.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.480]   - No, fix it.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.720]   - I love it that they use an open source Scrabble word list.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.840]   I just think that's great.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.320]   The same one is letter press, no not real.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.000]   - Yeah, well, the letter press word list is Scrab,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.880]   but that's another matter.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.720]   I'm sorry, I tell you that.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.200]   - All right, now it's serious.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.520]   - All right, here we go.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.320]   - Flour, it's so a word, damn it.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.760]   (laughing)
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.560]   I use it all the time.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.520]   Oh, look at all the flurin' on this pan.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.360]   - Yeah.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.200]   - I actually get those points.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.040]   - Flurin' is a good word.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.080]   It's a word everyone should use regularly.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.680]   - Perfectly crumulent word.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.160]   - 10.9 server.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.360]   Mavericks man in our chat room really wants me
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.000]   to say something like 10.9 server.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.520]   I assume there will be one.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.360]   - Thank you.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.200]   - I think it's on apple.com, isn't it?
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.040]   - They talk about it.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.080]   There's some really cool stuff.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.040]   I think the code sharing thing from Xcode.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:12.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.040]   - Yeah, there's OS Mavericks server, very exciting.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.880]   - Sure.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   - If you have a neck beard, you'll be happy.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.600]   - Feel how excited we are.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.120]   (laughing)
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.000]   - Actually, there are some very interesting features to that,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.320]   but I wouldn't know, 'cause I had signed the name.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.320]   - Max Err weekly.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.200]   - Next server weekly, it's a new show.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.040]   Do we know anything about the iPhone 5s or next or whatever?
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.960]   Is it gonna be a 6?
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.080]   Is it gonna be a 5s?
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.200]   Is Apple gonna break the mold?
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.280]   They seem to be breaking the mold a lot lately.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.360]   - It doesn't matter.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.520]   That's a marketing decision.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.600]   It's the same thing with software.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.560]   You can call software, they call it Mavericks.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.480]   These things are made, you know,
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.320]   - Terrible name, by the way.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.880]   - Yeah, but I mean, just because it is filed,
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.800]   people lost their minds last year
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.320]   when they called it the iPhone 5,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.600]   because it's a sick iPhone.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.800]   But again, it's completely marketing.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.640]   A bunch of people will sit down and they'll say,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.400]   "Oh, we'll call it the new iPhone."
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.240]   And that'll be the name they walk out on the slide.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.360]   So it's entirely not worth worrying about what they call it.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.160]   But physically, from what I've heard
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.360]   and from the parts that we've seen.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.560]   - They look very similar.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.800]   - It's gonna be an iPhone,
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.560]   it's gonna be to the iPhone 5,
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.600]   what the iPhone 4s was to the iPhone 4.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.800]   - But maybe a new A7 chip and sign?
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.760]   - Very likely.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.520]   And that's, again, every generation they seem to do that,
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.360]   it's the same tick talk we've talked about with Intel,
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.920]   where they move to a new architecture with the 5
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.800]   and the 5s, you'll start getting a lot more benefits
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.960]   on that architecture.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.240]   And I haven't heard about power,
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.560]   but I've heard about advancements
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.520]   and seeing what they did with the MacBook Air,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.680]   it makes me wonder if, again, battery life
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.920]   is becoming more of a concern than power,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.120]   'cause I don't think a lot of people would say
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.320]   the 5 is under power.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.560]   - No, it's fast enough.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.760]   Let's get better battery life.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.360]   That really is the issue this way.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.920]   And that helps with the iPhone 5.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.600]   - And according to your supposition earlier in the show,
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.120]   this might be the hardware that iOS 7 was designed for.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   - Well, I think it's almost certain that the new iPhone
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.440]   will be dropping when iOS 7 drops more or less
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.600]   within a couple of days.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.440]   And it will be, you know, it'll have some features
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.360]   that older iPhones won't have,
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.160]   that are iOS 7 features,
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.000]   but they're really new iPhone features.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.400]   - Is there anything in the code that we've seen
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.640]   that might hint a fingerprint recognition
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.480]   or anything like that?
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.320]   - I haven't seen any of those stories lately.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.160]   - No magic.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.760]   - The magic probably is very diligent
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.880]   in trying to keep that stuff out.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.760]   They know how people look for that stuff.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.240]   But they have to think games.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.800]   They put stuff in that is deliberately false now
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.520]   just to mess with people who look at the code strings.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.840]   Like iOS 10, comma one, you know, they put that kind of stuff.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   - Yeah.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.480]   - Yeah, so the, but I think definitely iOS 7 is gonna look
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.440]   best on whatever they roll out with iOS 7
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.400]   and that'll be a new iPhone.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.960]   Presumably new iPad, maybe new iPad mini too.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.880]   - And when you look further out,
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.720]   I mean, they have all these bezel gestures now
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.480]   and doing bezel gestures on hard edges
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   is not the best feeling in the world in Apple.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.640]   Especially Johnny Ive is really interested in feeling.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.760]   So maybe after the iPhone 5S,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.720]   when you start getting into 2014 hardware,
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.080]   maybe the new form factors start to better suit
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   the new kinds of direct manipulations that iOS 7 makes so easy.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.760]   - I wonder if we're gonna see hard edges still
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.920]   'cause it just seems like a odd juxtaposition
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.080]   given the scheme of how things flow on iOS 7.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.440]   - Yeah, 10, 14, I think.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.800]   - And isn't it incredible that we're,
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.960]   Apple's probably the only company where we would think,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.560]   where we would even entertain the thought
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.640]   that no, they're going to make a softer edge,
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.840]   rounder edged iPhone because aesthetically
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.640]   that would match the operating system they're creating.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.120]   - Let me ask you a question.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.240]   Are you tired of carrying your smartphone
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.600]   while running, cycling, or golfing?
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.000]   Have you ever struggled to pull your phone out of a bag
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.760]   and missed an important call?
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.840]   Wish you could get rid of all those fitness gadgets
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.280]   to just carry one handy tool with you while you exercise.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.920]   I bet you do.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.240]   You thought the Pebble Watch was it?
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.880]   - No, it's the Cryos.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.160]   Another, this is an indie go-go, not a Kickstarter.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.000]   - I'm Troy McClure.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.080]   You may know me from such movies as Lead Paint,
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.560]   Domitious, but deadly.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.600]   - This is the first interactive smartwatch.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.160]   - Word style, your Peter Prisma.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.600]   - That lets you use voice and gestures
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.240]   to control the functions you love.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.200]   Now, are you still wearing your Pebble?
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.040]   - I do, I have my time with you.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.920]   - I saw you showing off, we got a leather band.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.720]   - Yeah, the final band is awful.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.840]   - You feel like it's a rubber or whatever, yeah.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.160]   - Standard band, yeah.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.560]   You know, a lot of promises.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.280]   There was a company in Mackerel X-Bo
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.200]   that had a super awesome--
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.600]   - Samsung announced a watch last.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.440]   - Yeah, but these indie ones, you know,
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.760]   the one at Mackerel X-Bo, we actually just surrounded
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   on Mackerel that was very clear that it was an imaginary
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.360]   product that they were hoping to have been at some point.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.640]   This one, again, I don't know the details of this,
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.080]   but having used the Pebble, iOS is very limited
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.560]   in what it can do with these remote devices.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.480]   So I'm really skeptical about whether this is something that--
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.080]   - They think you can activate Siri remotely.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.920]   You can use Siri for your Bluetooth, that's Bluetooth.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.080]   - Yes.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080]   - We can't.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.640]   - It could be a Bluetooth, have you?
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.720]   - Yeah.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.480]   - Yeah, it could be.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.080]   It could be, I'm a little skeptical.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.600]   And of course, as soon as all these things come out,
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.880]   somebody, you know, Apple, come out,
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.720]   - Apple do it. - Apple do it, yeah.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.480]   - You know, I love the mockups,
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.920]   but I just feel like we've been burned before
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.120]   by promises here.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.480]   Even the Pebble has a lot of missing functionality.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.080]   I stopped wearing my Pebble.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.280]   - You know, I like it.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.000]   It's fine, but there's a lot of stuff missing,
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.160]   especially on iOS, because there's some bugs,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.920]   and there's some OS features that just aren't there.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.080]   - So, dream a little dream.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.080]   - Should I share this?
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.600]   - This is just made up.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.840]   These guys got like a white watch on,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.560]   he's pretending that it's that.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.200]   - Oh, that's a bill you can wear on your neck.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.920]   - I mean, how stupid would people look wearing a device
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.160]   like that around your neck?
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.720]   I mean, how big of a nerd you have to be to have,
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.800]   like be more than something like that.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.040]   - Cut to Andy, would you? - Cut to Andy.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:50.880]   - Cut to Andy.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.440]   Why would you wear their neck when you could wear it
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.680]   on your head?
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.000]   - That might have been a funnier job,
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.680]   but it wasn't a very funny job.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.520]   - Play your play of 2013.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.840]   - Google Glass, the smart watch for your face.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.200]   - Can you, you could almost do everything
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.560]   that this says it will do with glass.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.040]   Answer phone calls, not yet.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.080]   Activate Siri remotely.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.720]   You can talk, can you talk, I can't,
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.400]   can you do yoga on a surfboard?
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   That's really the real thing.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.240]   - What the hell?
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.440]   - I've been doing yoga on a surfboard
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.000]   and wondering, I need to answer it.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.160]   - I wish I could answer my phone right now.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.000]   - Without interrupting my downward dog.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.120]   - Well, she's quite good at that.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.480]   You know, it's worth watching the video just for that.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.720]   - They need the version of this video
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.920]   in black and white of the person who can't do that
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.080]   and falls off the surfboard.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080]   - Oh, well, is this the video where the hawk
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.800]   comes down and picks her up and the surf's up?
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.120]   - It's waterproof.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:41.960]   - Tell me more.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.800]   - And so is she.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.640]   - Now how much would you pay?
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.800]   - Wow.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.640]   - There's more.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.760]   - You can interact with your smartphone.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.720]   - You know, people do do yoga on surfboards.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.880]   I've seen people do it right here in the Fettaluma River.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.000]   So it's not that odd.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.280]   - No, they just don't have that watch.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.400]   - They're not wearing that watch.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.240]   Underperforming.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.360]   - I don't know, I think this is one of the reasons
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.880]   why I wonder if Apple's gonna hang back for a while
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.360]   on a watch because there are opportunities
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.040]   for other companies to make these things
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.400]   and get laughed at a lot.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.720]   (laughs)
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.920]   But there'll be a lot of people who are going to say
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.400]   specifically, here's what I would have liked this to do
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.520]   and I'll give them more focus.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.080]   Sony today announced the second version of the smart watch
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.400]   they released last year and it's an Android device
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.240]   which means it can have a lot of connectivity
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.840]   and a lot of interactivity with an Android phone.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.320]   And that's certainly not the best way to do anything
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.440]   but at least these things in the field
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.240]   will give a hands-on idea of what kind of person
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.640]   would actually wanna buy such a thing.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.960]   - I think this is gonna be a real product category.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.080]   I've skipped some for individual devices
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.920]   but and also skepticism about how good a job Android
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.080]   and iOS interact with these devices right now.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.160]   I think it's early days and there're gonna be some
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.960]   interesting fall starts and there're gonna be some things
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.160]   that are flops and I do think we'll get there
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.000]   but it is so early that the make no mistake
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.640]   these are for crazy tech people only right now.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.760]   - It's weird because they haven't even solved,
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.640]   they don't really have any ideas on the basic question
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.200]   of what features and functions should be on the phone
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.800]   and what features do the people actually want to have access
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.000]   on their watch.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.160]   That's not even necessarily okay music player
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.120]   that might be nice okay watch look at text
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.320]   that might be nice but once you get past
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.960]   what do you do for item number four,
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.640]   item number five, item number six?
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.320]   What, how will people relate to this?
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.480]   And that's the most, that's a basic question
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.360]   you have to solve about any new piece of technology
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.560]   before you actually start go into full production on it
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.240]   and no one really has any idea.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.600]   - It reminds me so much of this Casio calculator watch.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.440]   - Oh yeah, yes.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.280]   - Came with a little tiny style.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   - That's my pebble totally reminds me
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.120]   of a calculator watch.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.200]   - Those were always awesome.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.720]   - You were so special.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.160]   - I had a calculator watch in high school
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.880]   maybe I have said too much.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.360]   - I think it's the same exact people.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.680]   - Who didn't Jason?
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.520]   Who didn't?
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.360]   - Could be.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.520]   I honestly am one of those people who's like,
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.680]   "Well I could take my phone out of my pocket
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.120]   to see who texted me or I could look at my watch."
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.880]   And that's easier 'cause I'm lazy.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.960]   - Tokyo court ruled on Friday that Samsung has
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.000]   infringed Apple's bounce back patent.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.320]   These fights are everywhere.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.920]   - They're all over the world.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.240]   All over the world.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.760]   - Worse than zombie movies.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.040]   - That would be, that would be a movie.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.440]   - Worse than even than World War Z.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.760]   - Did you see World War Z?
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.520]   - I have people said good things about World War Z.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.680]   I'm not supposed to talk about movies or TV anymore.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   - Would get in trouble.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.240]   - People yell at me.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.640]   - What did this health start, this spoiler thing?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.560]   What about your weenies?
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560]   When did this start?
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.400]   - Can we run it down?
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.480]   - It's a rose bud, was his childhood sled.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.000]   - Oh, no, I haven't seen that before.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.320]   - The girl in the crying games actually die.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.880]   - What is the statute of limitations on spoilers?
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.360]   Is it a month, six months a year?
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.640]   - All the people in life were in limbo.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.480]   - Really?
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.080]   I haven't seen lost yet.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.920]   - Only at the very end though, not for the rest of it.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.760]   What else?
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.600]   We haven't any other good spoilers.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.440]   We can get out here.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.280]   - We can't really ruin this people.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.120]   - So I like the greenest people.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.360]   - Yes, people.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.000]   - At the end of the prisoner was not worth the wait.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.840]   - Not worth it.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.680]   - That's right.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.680]   - We don't know what happened.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.320]   - Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.520]   and Princess Leia's father.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.880]   Because they were twins.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.320]   I know, I know.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.560]   - I know, what is it possible you're saying to yourself?
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.400]   But it's true.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.640]   - But I don't remember this spoiler thing earlier in life.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.840]   I mean, this is something new.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840]   - No, it's new.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.680]   I mean, it was-
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.440]   - Is it 'cause we all watch TV later now?
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.280]   - Yeah, that's it.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.120]   That's it.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:29.960]   - Nobody watches it when it's on.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.800]   - It used to be watch the show when it's on.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.840]   And you go to work the next day
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.360]   and around the water cooler, you say.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.080]   I can't believe that somebody shot JR, right?
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.400]   And now, you know, people on the East Coast
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.600]   are tweeting about Game of Thrones
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.040]   while I'm like cooking my dinner.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.960]   - I could've used a warning for that.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   I wanna be honest with you.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.320]   - I read the dinner.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.720]   I read the book, so I wasn't spoiled.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.880]   But I was like, I told my wife,
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.920]   do not be on Twitter now.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.320]   Just get off of Twitter now.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.960]   - Don't watch Twitter 'cause you don't wanna know.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.040]   - Yeah, and Twitter is great for those shared experiences,
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.080]   but when people are out of sync, it's bad.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:58.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.760]   Well, plus me, even like news sites,
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.520]   like for people who are fans of like these movies
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.600]   and these comic books,
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.720]   when you say, I'm just not gonna read anything
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.280]   about the new Star Trek movie.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.560]   And then the headlines say, well,
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.480]   people are the controversial ending of Star Trek
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.000]   and the blum, blum, blum.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.080]   What do you think?
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   I think that I know have no reason to see the movie
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.680]   because of the headline in my RSS feeder
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.200]   just told me what the ending of this movie was.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.040]   - Thank you.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.520]   - But is that why you go see a movie
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.760]   is to see the twist?
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.600]   - No, I don't.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.520]   - I needed to see it all the time ago.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.960]   I wanna see how well it's done.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.800]   I already know the ending.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.680]   I'll watch movies several times.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.040]   I just wanna see how well it's done.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.000]   But also stories were meant to be told
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.320]   as a sequence of events.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.040]   The person who created this movie
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.800]   did not intend for you to walk in,
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.960]   knowing that this is what you're going to,
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.480]   everything you're seeing right now builds up to this scene
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.440]   that happens to him before the ending of it.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.320]   So it's not like I would not see a movie
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.240]   that I was interested in seeing
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.840]   'cause I know what happens at the end.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.760]   But it's like, congratulations.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.920]   You've just basically put my favorite sweater in the wash
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.680]   and shrunk it one and a half sizes.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.920]   I can still wear it,
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.560]   but it's no longer going to be as pleasant a thing as a--
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.400]   - Sure.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.240]   - Could have been if it did not do that part.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.040]   - Obviously, Annie's coming down on the side
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.720]   of the no spoilers.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.040]   - I think the best thing to do--
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.720]   - I do think there's a statute of limitations.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.120]   I think the window for spoilers opens
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.760]   one month after movies release closes.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.280]   - One month, okay.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.240]   - I think it closes again when the thing comes out
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.560]   on video and then opens again
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.000]   like a month, month and a half after that.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.840]   The chat room, by the way,
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.680]   don't go on our chat rooms,
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.280]   it's just been filled with spoilers.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.840]   - Andy's got sort of a double hung window spoiler.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.160]   - Right, double hung Andy.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.000]   - Yep.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.240]   - That's the only thing at the top.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.600]   - The window in the bottom window
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.440]   and it's a--
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.280]   - The sash open.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.120]   - It's architecture humor.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.960]   - Leo, come on.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.800]   - I get it.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.640]   Are there counter waiting?
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.480]   - Okay, counter waiting.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.320]   - The window is a winner.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.840]   - I'll switch the spoiler screens for--
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.560]   - The best thing is to be blissfully ignorant
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.320]   and then when it's like years later
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.960]   and everybody thinks that they've spoiled it,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.800]   then watch it.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.320]   I had a friend who never watched Lost
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.640]   and she watched it about six months ago
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.680]   and you know it's great because the spoilers
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.080]   have faded away.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:54.920]   - Right.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.760]   - She can just watch it.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.880]   - I'm saving all this stuff for the old day show
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.760]   'cause Alzheimer's, I won't remember.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.600]   - Either, I don't remember now.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.600]   - You just have to watch the same few episodes over and over.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   - Over and over.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.440]   - Every day.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.280]   - Groundhog is--
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.160]   - Oh my God, Zod broke RSS.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.000]   - Oh yes.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.080]   - It's coming into the feeds.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:08.920]   - Oh my God.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.080]   - No, no, no, that was an after effect
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.440]   of the Superboy punch.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.000]   (laughing)
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.440]   Enough of your Superboy punches and not go.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.840]   - It brought that character
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.600]   into the Marvel Universe also.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.200]   - The chat room is the best thing in the world right now.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.280]   - It is seriously, everything goes crazy.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.120]   - Everything goes crazy.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:27.960]   - Everything goes spoiler and ever.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:28.800]   - Super spoilers.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.320]   - So is the Quizatch?
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.160]   - Also--
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.280]   - And who shot JR?
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.360]   - Khan.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.880]   - Khan, now my phone's ringing.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.720]   - The Macbreak is a killing link.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.280]   - That's JR.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   - Jason, would you like to update your--
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.280]   - But it's a Nokia phone, don't answer it, it's Zod.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.640]   (laughing)
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.400]   - Yeah, it's not only uses Nokia, Lumius.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.880]   - I don't know if I'm proud of you
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.640]   or just pleased with you that you did a one word answer
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.880]   of Khan and just simply said it as though it was one syllable.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.720]   - Khan.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.560]   - Oh!
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.320]   - You know, I'm not really mad at Khan right now
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.920]   to do the full on Shatner.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.760]   - That's right.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.600]   - I don't know.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.440]   - Just a fact, I'm just talking about Khan.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.880]   - Well, even then he was pretending,
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.480]   don't you feel a chip that was un-genuine,
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.360]   anger at Khan?
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.760]   Good, just gracious.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.200]   - Of course, Andy, it's called Act A.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.560]   - Andy cut to Bobby Ewing, crouched over JR's bloody body.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.240]   He looks to the sky and shouts as only Patrick Duffy could.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.080]   - Khan!
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.080]   - All right, that's a mashup.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.120]   - That's a mashup, I want to see.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.880]   - Thanks, Chadroob.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.000]   - Wow, we love you, Chadroob.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.840]   They're going crazy right now in the Chadroob.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.960]   - Best rat hole ever.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.000]   - Best rat hole ever.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.720]   We're gonna take a break when we come back.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.120]   Pics of the week, Jason Stell is here
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.400]   from Macworld Magazine, editor in cheat.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.320]   You're still the editor in cheat.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.800]   - Sure, why not?
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.240]   - From imore.com and a lot of other points north,
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.720]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, and he'll not go from the Chicago
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.520]   Sun-Times and his cows and squirrel.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.960]   - He's got a menagerie.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.000]   - Muson scoodle.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.800]   - I'm like St. Francis, I'm the friend
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.720]   to all living creatures.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.400]   - So I'm there stuffed.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.560]   - As long as they don't spoil the ending of the movie.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.400]   - Yeah, man.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.320]   - I saw Superman like four days after it opened.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.120]   It was like, it was such an effort to make sure
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.760]   I did not know what happened in the movie.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.000]   - Dang, dang, dang.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:18.840]   - My phone is--
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.520]   - But I call him all of the living things.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.000]   - No, isn't there just like a little switch that you can,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:23.920]   oh, well, no.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.000]   - Yeah, there is, I should have just switched it.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.360]   - I used to have a thing.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.680]   Oh, I feel bad.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.120]   I took the wifi router out of the house
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.200]   and my daughter can't do her homework.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.680]   I knew this would happen.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.240]   - Homework, is she in summer school?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.640]   - Yeah. - Oh.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.240]   - Just do what you all did.
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.720]   Just go to the basement, get the Britannica out.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.560]   - Yeah, really?
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.600]   - If it's not in the Britannica,
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.240]   it's probably not worth citing.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.040]   - I'm gonna text her, sorry, I took the router.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.400]   - Sorry, I took the router, comma.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.880]   You better go to moms.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.120]   Sorry, again, bye.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.400]   - You're a good egg Leo.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.920]   - You just borrow a cup of wifi.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.800]   - Show today brought to you by Squarespace.com,
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.520]   ladies and gentlemen, now,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.160]   if you don't have internet access,
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.720]   this is not going to benefit you.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.160]   But here's the good news.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.840]   Squarespace never runs out of internet access.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.760]   You cannot, I can bring down,
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.200]   we could point the vast and malicious twin army
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.600]   at any site and bring it down.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.600]   I could do it right now, I have that power.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.320]   Unless it's running on Squarespace,
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.200]   for some reason we just, we try,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.840]   we send thousands of people bombarding a site
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.320]   and they cannot bring it down.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.360]   It's 'cause Squarespace has the best hosting,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.040]   the best hosting in the market.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.080]   And on top of it, the best content management system,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.640]   the software that you use is fabulous.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.080]   If you wanna create your own space,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.200]   whether it's a website, a portfolio,
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.480]   an e-commerce site, a mobile site,
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.000]   Squarespace is a place to go.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.600]   Great support, great training,
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.120]   they have fabulous forums, videos,
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.960]   they even do workshop seminars free
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.040]   for Squarespace customers.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.160]   You can, it started right now,
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.480]   you don't have to take my word for it,
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.280]   just click the get started button at Squarespace.com.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.000]   Pick your template, so many nice ones,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.840]   new ones all the time,
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.760]   try that new momentum, full bleed template,
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.680]   it's gorgeous.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.680]   Two weeks, no credit card needed,
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.960]   just play with it, import your existing content,
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.400]   they've got importers for all the major blogs.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.680]   You could just fill it up, put your comments in there,
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.640]   from your old blog, all the images,
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.800]   all the links still work, knock on it, bang on it,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.200]   send all your friends there,
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.160]   send the Twitter army there.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.280]   Then after two weeks, if you say,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.800]   "Hey, I think this is gonna work for me."
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.680]   Boy, they have great prices, really good prices.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.560]   The Squarespace site can be as little as $8 a month.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.120]   $8 a month when you buy a year contract,
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.160]   $10 if you just wanna go month to month.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.920]   But the most popular is the unlimited plan.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.440]   This is such a good deal.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.800]   When you buy an annual plan, $16 a month,

[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.800]   Go there today, time for our picks of the week.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.440]   Let's start with Renee Richie this week.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.520]   Hi Renee.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.160]   - Hi, I'm gonna zig-a-set a Zag Leo.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.040]   A couple weeks ago, Alex Lindsey was talking about
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.560]   Final Cut Pro X and how they use it.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.640]   And I had been using iMovie,
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.120]   I moved to Final Cut Pro X a while ago,
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.040]   and it turns out through a bunch of bad circumstances
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.680]   that I ended up being the one who had to edit
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.440]   a lot of the videos, the smaller ones,
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.760]   not the big ones for our talk mobile event.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.280]   And I'm not a video editor,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.680]   but I used Final Cut Pro X and it was incredibly easy.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.840]   Even I managed to do a multi-camera shoot.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.360]   I was shown in about five minutes,
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.000]   had to set up multi-angle over three different cameras,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.160]   and within about 30 minutes, I had a 20 minute clip,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.000]   which was good enough to make people think
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.440]   that someone who ought to be doing it
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.200]   was actually doing it.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.440]   And I would never have been able to do that
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.640]   on the original Final Cut Pro.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.240]   I could do that laboriously in iMovie
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.880]   by carefully trying to cut two cameras together, maybe.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.200]   But Final Cut Pro really allowed me to achieve
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.360]   pretty damn good results without knowing
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.520]   almost anything about how the process is meant to work.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.600]   I just dragged, I can do audio because of podcasts,
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.560]   so I did a lot of the audio and other sources.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.200]   I brought it in, I layered in lower thirds.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:54.160]   I had a mountain of little graphical lines in the end,
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.440]   but it rendered out into an actual video
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.760]   that I could put on the internet.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.600]   Amazing.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.640]   I could fool everybody with.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.600]   And I was really, really happy.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.520]   So did you read the manual or anything?
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.360]   No.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.920]   I dove in and it's one of those examples, I think,
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.040]   where Apple really did anger a lot of professionals,
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.000]   but it allowed me to achieve results
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.880]   that I would never have been able to do
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.880]   using the previous version of the product.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.520]   So I was really happy.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.760]   You know, I'm so scared of it.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.120]   I just use iMovie.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.720]   It was easy, it was like using iMovie.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.080]   I should really do it.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.920]   I mean, that's the knock on it from the Pro side,
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.800]   but for a consumer or a pro-silly high-movie pro.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.280]   It is in many ways.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.520]   And I've done some stuff with it and it's really easy to use.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.920]   It's amazing.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:37.920]   You convinced me from that.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:38.760]   I'll try it.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.280]   It's so easy that Alex is now convincing me
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.120]   to move over to Logic from Garage Bannas, my next step.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.040]   Join us over in Logic.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.640]   I love Logic.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.480]   I love Logic.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.320]   It's just me a huge magic.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.040]   Logic is awesome.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.920]   I make all my beats in Logic.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.240]   Hey, don't knock it.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.520]   Wiz Khalifa follows me on Twitter.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.840]   Nice.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.960]   I asked him if he wanted to make beats.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.320]   Jake.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.160]   He said no.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.000]   He said no.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.960]   Oh, the one thing I'll add is that they're about to,
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.720]   Apple did announce that they're making a new version
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.400]   that'll take advantage of all the new stuff
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.240]   they're putting in things like the new Mac Pro.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.120]   Which eventually will trickle down to the other machines,
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.120]   I assume.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.440]   Do I have to buy a new Mac Pro?
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.440]   No.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.360]   If you need a reason, we have a good one.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360]   Everybody asks--
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360]   We'll get you a trash can.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   Everybody's telling you what to tell you.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360]   Oh, it's pretty.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.360]   Everybody says when is Alex Lindsey going to come on
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.120]   and say what he thinks of the new Mac Pro?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.960]   And we haven't-- he's been out traveling.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.960]   We'll get him back in as soon as we can.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.960]   I can't imagine--
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.200]   He sure he has opinions.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.400]   If you go to kickingbear.com,
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.960]   I English at an amazing article about what the GPU means to him
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.520]   as a graphics programmer and the ability--
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.880]   the kind of applications we might be able to get from a machine
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.480]   that's so graphically powerful.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.000]   And it was--
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.960]   He says, I can't stop thinking about the new Mac Pro.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.200]   As a perspective, we've had so much talk about iOS 7.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.320]   And he really--
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.560]   Renee was saying that it made him get
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.000]   excited about the new Mac Pro in a way
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.120]   that he hadn't been before.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.880]   And Guy, as a developer, makes some really interesting points
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.600]   about why he's enthusiastic about what's new in the Mac Pro.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   We'll see.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.600]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.600]   But he's-- you know, there's an interesting stuff in there
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600]   that hasn't really been used before.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   And I agree that he wouldn't be fantasizing about the Mac Pro
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   if Apple had just taken the old cheese grater
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   and upgraded it.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.600]   But that's what they should have done.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.600]   That's what everybody else except kickingbear wanted.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   Kickingbear is excited because he's, you know,
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600]   he's lusting for it.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   Yeah, I don't know if people wanted another cheese grater.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.600]   And, you know, when does Apple give people what they want?
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.600]   Yeah, I mean, if people give people what they think they need.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600]   Right.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600]   It's Apple.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600]   What do you think we need, Mr. Jason?
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.600]   Now, what's your pick of the week?
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   My pick of the week, it's a little bit-- you can use it now,
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   but it'll be really great when Mavericks comes out,
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:49.600]   which is an app called AirServer, which is $15 from airserver.com.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   It turns your Mac into a receiver for--
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.600]   Airplay.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   I never understood what this is for.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600]   So you'll get it.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   So you can Airplay to a Mac from somewhere else.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   You could Airplay to a Mac from your iPad,
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.600]   in which case your iPad video would appear on the screen.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.600]   Can I do everything on the Mac anyway?
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.600]   You can't.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.600]   Okay, so here's my scenario that I think this is most interesting.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   As you get an iMac and it's a couple of years old,
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600]   and you want to get a new iMac, or you want to get a laptop,
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   and you've got that beautiful screen,
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.600]   you can turn the iMac not into a TV with Mavericks,
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:21.600]   you can turn it into an external display.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   Just using the built-in software, using AirServer on your old iMac
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.600]   and the new Airplay features on Mavericks.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.600]   There's a little bit of lag, but not too much.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.600]   You can put a lot of extra stuff over there,
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.600]   and you just turn that old Mac into an external monitor.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.600]   You couldn't do that before just hardware it.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.600]   You couldn't, except on those very certain iMacs
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.600]   where you could do HDMI in, but with this,
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   it's all in software.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.600]   There were some hacks that you could use before that would do it,
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   but now it's just going to be built into the OS.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.600]   Well, that's good news.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   You run AirServer.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.600]   I think it's a really clever idea,
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.600]   and if you've ever wanted to do something like capture a screen of an iPad,
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.600]   maybe to capture video on your Mac, it'll work for that too,
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   because it'll do Airplay mirroring.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.600]   As if your Mac becomes an Apple TV set.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.600]   And they put out that for education, this would be good.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600]   If you were a teacher, you had an iPad,
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.600]   you had one to show this case.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   You can project it onto any Mac.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.600]   But I think with Mavericks,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600]   this becomes much more interesting.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   A lot of people get an iMac and it maybe slows down
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600]   and they can't use it very much,
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   but it's still got a great screen.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.600]   The screen still works fine.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.600]   $15, and that's worth five licenses.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.600]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600]   And they have student licenses, etc.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.600]   Yeah, it's a cool idea, and it works.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   I tried it out today.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.600]   Works great.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.600]   I just got my love handles.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   Actually, I ordered two things from iLove handles,
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600]   and they're back-ordered on the one that I really wanted,
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600]   but when I got to the website, I said,
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.600]   "Well, maybe I'll get that too."
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.600]   So, ilovehandles.com,
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.600]   and the thing that I wanted is they make the stiff cord,
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600]   the stiff lightning cord,
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   so that you could just have your iPhone stick up out of your Mac,
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   because it's like a little gumbie.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600]   And I just like that idea,
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.600]   or I could plug it into the wall and have it stick up off the wall.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600]   But then while I was there, I thought,
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.600]   "Well, this is kind of a neat company."
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   They do interesting things.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600]   They're backward.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   I guess my trunk will start showing it.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600]   It will ship in a couple of weeks.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600]   No, actually, the 25th, a couple of days.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.600]   So, I'll show you that when that comes.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.600]   But I did get my plank.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   So, I'll show you the plank.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.600]   Now, this is a clever idea, I think.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   By the way, $30.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600]   It's a nice piece of wood.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.600]   Okay.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.600]   And it has a mounting thing,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.600]   so you can screw it into the wall, you know,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.600]   and then you put that on the wall.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600]   You put the wood on there, right?
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]   You might say, "Well, what's that for?"
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   Well, then you put your iPhone on top of it,
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600]   and it has a little magnetic thing
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.600]   that you can hang your keys from on the bottom.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600]   So, you put that right when you come in the door.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.600]   When you light, very Swedish.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.600]   That's how much for that piece of wood?
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.600]   But it's more than just a piece of wood.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   It's got a magnet taped to the bottom.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.600]   And a magnet on the bottom.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   And it's got this little thing.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.600]   $30.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.600]   Wow.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600]   What do you think the margins are on there?
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600]   Hey, come on.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600]   Apple sold how much does it sell its bumper for?
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.600]   Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600]   $0.05 a plastic.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   All right.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.600]   Well, all right.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.600]   I'm still...
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   Look, see?
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   It's so happy.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   She put it on the wall.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600]   Heart.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.600]   Big heart.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.600]   There's that heart.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.600]   You know, it's kind of...
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.600]   See, doesn't she look happy that she's got that on the wall?
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.600]   Listen, to me to consider how many times the thought,
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600]   "Hey, I could have made that.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   "Needs to be followed by, yeah, but you're not going to."
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.600]   But I would.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.600]   I could have made this in shop class.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.600]   Sure.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600]   If I was looking for a block of wood,
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   a wall-mountable block of wood for my iPhone,
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600]   I would probably buy that instead of making it myself.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.600]   You could have your keys from the bottom.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   I would have invented Facebook.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   Oh, ye of little face.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600]   You'll be so jealous when you come to my house,
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600]   and I just have my phone on a little plank.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:55.600]   Exactly.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.600]   And you're going to say, "Oh, that's a really great idea."
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.600]   And I saw something quite similar at CES two years ago that...
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600]   [laughter]
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.600]   And then Shenzhen Booth.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.600]   You could just find a piece of wood and nail it to the wall.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600]   This is much more elegant than that.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   And then it's much more...
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   And then stick a magnet on the bottom.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.600]   I wasn't sure.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.600]   It took by four with a bent nail sticking out of the walls, Jason.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600]   You did just walk outside and find that over.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.600]   They didn't mention how they were going to put it on the wall,
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:26.600]   and I just bought it in faith that they would somehow have a magic way
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600]   of mounting that on the wall.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.600]   Indeed.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   They do.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.600]   This is quite clever.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.600]   This is not unlike something you would see in a display at the Apple Store.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600]   And we all like the Apple Store, do we not?
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:38.600]   There you go.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   The throne rings around you logically.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.600]   And did I mention as a magnet on the bottom for your keys?
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.600]   A magnet on the bottom for your keys.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   Although I'm sold, Jason.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.600]   It comes with its own screws.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   Screws.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.600]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.600]   If you had a can of cantadina tomato paste, if you wanted to keep that there.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   It would also keep that there.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.600]   It's just a little key that it will magneto right to the bottom.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   That's why I don't do pics on this show anymore.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.600]   You guys are a bunch of crap.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.600]   It's a very nice piece of wood.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.600]   I'm totally with you, Leo.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.600]   I think that's neat.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.600]   I don't know.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   We have a magnetic shell for your phone.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600]   Look.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   It just seems like a weird collect.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.600]   I mean, and then there's also a magnet for your keys.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600]   It's just very precise.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   Don't worry, Leo.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.600]   He's an editor.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.600]   It's his job to shoot down people's likes and joys and dreams.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   I'm just glad I didn't bring this to the story.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:33.600]   Leo, Leo, did you sit at home thinking I wish I had a place to put my phone and also hang
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.600]   my keys or did you say this?
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.600]   Hey, Leo, I told you how this happened.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:41.600]   I wanted the Gumby USB cable.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.600]   It was at a stock.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.600]   So I ordered the plank instead.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.600]   I like the hard keys.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.600]   I just keep thinking about the some PR person who emailed the president of the company saying,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.600]   "Hey, definitely should listen to Mac break.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.600]   Because Leo's going to choose your thing as a think of the week.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.600]   I took some folks doing, but he's going to know how much thing is about attention."
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600]   It all begins today, I assure you.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600]   They also make little--
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   That's rocket moon to the top.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.600]   They also make like a dead fish in the mail from them with little heart on it.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.600]   They also make a little $15 pouch.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600]   You could put your phone in.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600]   You could be the PR person for that company.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   I'm now the head of PR at Apple.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.600]   We think we can get you a black power book, a model 5300 for loan, sometime in the next
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600]   three years.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   It's because it comes with a plank of wood.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.600]   We don't want to offend your artistic sensibilities, Jason, by sending you something you voted joy.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.600]   Well, unfortunately, you slightly scooped me because the way we brought iLoveHandals.com
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.600]   down.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.600]   Oh.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600]   So now adding some change.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.600]   Jason, Jason, I love-- we brought that site down.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.600]   We just simply gave it too much traffic.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.600]   Squarespace.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   They'll be back.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.600]   Go ahead.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.600]   This is a very simple product that I kind of like.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   It's from Kero Products, K-E-R-O.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   And it's nothing but a stubby little lightning cable.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   This is the sort of price.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.600]   It's nothing more than what you think it is.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   It is a simply lightning cable.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.600]   This big.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.600]   Unfortunately, the price of this is not commensurate with the length of the label relative to the
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.600]   of the cable relative to the length of a full size one.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   It is 25 bucks.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:27.600]   But the good news is that I like little cables like this because you are not--
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.600]   you're not liable to steal this out of your laptop bag or put it on your desk because you need something to pinch.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   This is the sort of thing where you basically keep it in your laptop bag or keep it in your purse or whatever your go to your go bag is.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   And it will stay there when you need when you're out of the house and you desperately need to charge up a lightning device.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600]   It will be there for you.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:56.600]   So on that basis, it's not expensive until the first time that you realize that you didn't think that your battery was at 6% and you really desperately need your phone to work for more than the next three minutes.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600]   See, look how floppy that was.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600]   Mine stands up.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.600]   Well, can you put keys in a bar and a keyrope on yours?
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600]   Ooh, look at that.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600]   You got a can.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600]   What do you got? A church key?
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.600]   What do you get? A drink a lot of beer in the road?
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600]   Well, keys.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.600]   Mine came with a free opener, which is not only bottles, but also cans.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600]   Are hanging keys on technology a thing?
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600]   Is that a thing now?
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.600]   Did I miss that thing?
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.600]   You didn't get the memo, Jason?
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.600]   Wow.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:25.600]   I have a 64 gigabyte flash drive on mine.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.600]   I got keys.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.600]   I like that, sick.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.600]   I have a tool that is necessary for the installation of an Apple disk to drive on my keys.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.600]   Maybe time to take that off.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.600]   Again, someday we'll be in the bunker in lost and they'll need to fix that disk drive.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:50.600]   And they'll say, well, we're screwed because surely nobody has that special tool.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.600]   And I'll say, I have this.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:00.600]   Andy, I go Chicago, Sun, Times, a must read every single day.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.600]   And we love talking to you every week on Mac break weekly.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.600]   He also does a knock-os-om-a-neck at 5x5.tv.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600]   What day do you do that?
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.600]   Usually every Thursday, I've had some bad luck in that.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:18.600]   Both me and Dan have been busy on Thursday, so I prerecorded a couple that will start going on based.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   Awesome.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.600]   And I'm sure he talks about comic books and pop culture stuff like that.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   Comics and movies and World War
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   and London.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:47.600]   I suppose if it were made in China, Jason would be all over it because he doesn't like people who work in Montana and build things with their hands.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.600]   The way this country was made.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.600]   You found me out, Andy.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.600]   See, I'm just sorry that you had to be outed in this way.
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:58.600]   That's sad.
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.600]   You've been Paula Deend.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.600]   Jason Howell is over there.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.600]   Jason Howell is over there.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.600]   So I'm just waving at him.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.600]   Jason Snell, on the other hand, is sitting right next to me.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:13.600]   I probably should talk to him instead.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.600]   He is, of course, editorial director at IDG where he heads.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.600]   He's the head honcho at Macworld Magazine and Macworld.com.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.600]   And look for his Mavericks part one soon.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.600]   Yes, soon on Macworld.com.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.600]   Good.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.600]   Good, good.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.600]   I want to read that.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.600]   imore.com is the place to find Mr. Renee Britche.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.600]   Well, that and Montreal.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   Yes, sir.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.600]   Rainy Montreal, right?
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:36.600]   Rainy Montreal.
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.600]   You say Montreal.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   Montreal.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]   Montreal.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Where?
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.600]   Excellon.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:43.600]   Excellon.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.600]   Where?
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:48.600]   If it's, when you come, we'll have put in and smoke meat and we will be happy.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600]   Oh, I love that.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600]   You guys are great.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600]   I don't know what accent that is.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.600]   Hey, thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.600]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.600]   Look, the instructions are inside.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600]   Did I mention that?
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   You came in on a map.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   You came in on a real paper.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.600]   And you can use that cardboard box for other things I'm betting, Leo.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.600]   It's like, yeah.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.600]   Oh, see?
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:14.600]   It's a display box.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.600]   So if you like, you can see the one.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   It's not really pretty much.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   You could put that as a display box.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.600]   You know what that is?
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.600]   That's the aspirational part of this packaging that hopefully get the Apple store, right?
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.600]   Aspirational.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:27.600]   Right there.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.600]   Someday this box will be on display.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.600]   You can't afford it, but it makes you look at other products in that line and associate
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   that product with class.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.600]   It is the Retina MacBook.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600]   It's a halo product.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.600]   It's a wooden show.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:41.600]   That is Retina wood.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.600]   I mean, the pixels in that wood are amazing.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:44.600]   I'll skew more folk.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   It's like one of those concept cars.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.600]   You don't really buy that.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.600]   If Louis Mantia had made a piece of wood, it would look like that.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.600]   We broke it, Leo.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.600]   Every Tuesday they break me 11 a.m.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.600]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   If you can watch live, we'd love it if you do.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   If not, on-demand audio and video available after the fact.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:10.600]   Anytime at twit.tv/mbw or, of course, wherever, find our podcasts or aggregated, displayed,
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.600]   stored and delivered directly to you.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   If you'd like to be here in studio, we do have a -- we're filmed before a studio audience.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.600]   Yeah, it's an excellent audience.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.600]   In this case, a nice, large audience.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   It's great to have you all.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   You can just email tickets at twit.tv and we will make sure that we have a chair put out
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   for you.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.600]   It's not required, but that way we have a chair.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.600]   Over our shoulders.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   Nice.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   Can some beautiful audience.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   They're a handsome audience.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   They're a good audience.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   They're a good audience.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   Well-mannered.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   Now you better get back to work because break time is over!
