[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   Tomorrow, we'll talk about the App Store killer features in iOS 14 and somewhat less
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.920]   killer and why Apple TV+ seems to be struggling.

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.200]   The Mac Break Trio has assembled Alex Lindsay's on assignment still.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.480]   But Renee Richie is with us from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   R-R-R-R.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.080]   I will try to do my best to make up for the technical geekery that is Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Oh my.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   But there's no chance.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   There's no way.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   He's still doing his office hours I know.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   But I guess he gets it each.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.480]   Yeah, I did it with him the other day.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   I suggest anyone who's going to check it out.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   Isn't it great?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.880]   Also with us Andy Inaco of Washington, WGBH Ray.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   I don't know where.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   They should be so lucky.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.480]   Yes, they should be so lucky.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.200]   IHNATKO.com.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.360]   It's his motto I think.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.880]   They should be so lucky.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   It'd be good.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   That'd be a good motto.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.600]   It's going to be on his great stuff.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.120]   In the appropriate like Mel Brooks Old Man Accident, they should be so lucky.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.400]   We are lucky because Lori Gill is also here.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.440]   She is a managing editor at iMore.com.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.840]   Hello Lori.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.320]   Hello.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Did Apple have quarterly results?
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   No, it's Thursday.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.720]   It'll happen on Thursday.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   This week.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.040]   After the testimony.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.840]   How do we swear?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   Normally don't they do it on Tuesdays?
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.480]   Usually they have for a lot of time.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.200]   So maybe they are waiting.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.000]   Well, no, because it was supposed to be Monday, but they had to cancel.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.200]   The Congress decided to postpone it until Wednesday because of a very, very distinguished
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.720]   personality who legislative and legend who was now lying in state.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   John Lewis.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.680]   Um, tomorrow, if this is Tuesday, it must be tomorrow.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   Tim Cook will.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680]   But day is it.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   You know, it's easy to forget these days.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   Tim Cook will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on anti-trust along with Jeff Bezos,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   Senator Pichai CEO of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The first time.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.360]   Not, not Satya Nadella, which is curious.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.160]   Yeah, not the Microsoft guy.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   No.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   It's a fantastic pick.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:58.320]   Um, it is the first time I think Bezos has ever testified in front of any congressional
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   committee.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   Tim has been there before, right?
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   Tim has been there before.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.120]   He's got like over a hundred billion dollars now.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.240]   I don't think he's doing it because he probably, he probably just bought the Capitol building
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   and wants to check it for drapes or something.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   That's why he's there.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   Or he could do like what the Hollywood studios do.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.480]   They fly the entire committee like to a luxury resort on a junket and like, you know, do
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.680]   it at a place of his choosing.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.280]   Have Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie give them, give them canapÃ©s while they're going over
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   it.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   It does.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   But it does, to be serious, it does show what a big deal this is.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   Bezos has always ducked this.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.680]   He's always found every possible excuse to get out of it.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.160]   Zuckerberg could be talked into it, but this is the, let's remind ourselves that this
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.600]   isn't just like election year.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.560]   We really, I really need some footage of me behind a microphone on a level higher than
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.000]   the hundred billionaire making my finger at him.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.960]   This is a pre-announced like multi-year investigation into antitrust all across the tech industry
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.240]   that is buttressed not only the federal level, but also at the state attorney general level.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   So if they, if these CEOs do not find time in their schedules, they are going to encountering
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000]   increasingly hostile panels.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.200]   Although the cynic, the cynic, the cynical view is that they agreed to do it because
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.960]   it's all four of them and they believe that because all of their positions are under investigation
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.720]   but are so different that having the spotlight on all four of them prevents it from being
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.440]   any one of them.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.920]   So Ben Thompson is, to tech, we wrote some sample questions, but today he tweeted about
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.560]   a New York Times article.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   Their business went, businesses went virtual.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.680]   And Apple wanted to cut talking about Airbnb and class pass.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.320]   Class pass began selling virtual classes because of the pandemic.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.800]   Apple tried to collect its commission on the sale and Ben highlighted this sentence from
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   the Times article.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   Apple also pointed out that Airbnb had never paid any Apple any money despite the fact
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.280]   that it built its million dollar business with the help of its iPhone app.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   Now you can interpret that as Apple proudly, proudly pointed out.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.640]   We never asked them for any money.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.880]   Although they, you know, there is this rent seeking bit of Apple's app store business where
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.840]   Airbnb built a business and now has a new business.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   And Apple says, yes, we'd like 30% if you want your app to be on the store.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.480]   See, YouTube takes 45% from me.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   So, right.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   Well, you don't know, do you?
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   Tell you what it takes.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.280]   Yeah, I believe it's 45%.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   Okay.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   But it's not, I know you weren't making a direct comparison, but it still is a good
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.360]   idea to point out that basically you are, you are mailing them like a high definition
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.320]   video cassette and they're agreeing to like stream it to the entire world in perpetuity
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   and also sell ads for you.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.240]   Whereas Apple is saying, Apple, I always think that Apple is being a little bit coy here because
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   they're also saying that if all these other companies said, gosh, we're sorry, Apple.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.760]   We're sorry that we offended you by not paying you enough money.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:15.320]   We Airbnb and Uber and every single app that people rely on, we've decided to stop abusing
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.920]   you by stop supporting the iPhone and make people use web apps to connect to our services
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   instead.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.840]   I mean, Apple needs these companies as much as they need, as much as they need Apple.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.360]   And also given the testimony we're talking about in front of the house on Wednesday,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.400]   they also need to be able to demonstrate that they're not just some sort of a racket that's
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.000]   saying that, first of all, you're not allowed to be to have a presence on our platform unless
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.640]   you sell through our store.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.040]   And also you are required to conform to whatever terms we dictate for use of the store.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.280]   So it's an interesting, the article from the New York Times picks these two because they're
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.760]   unique situations, class pass, which before the quarantine had a business helping people
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.960]   book exercise classes at local gyms, a feature app, controversially app.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   Yeah, but Apple didn't charge them for that.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.000]   Then class pass obviously had no business after gyms closed.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.040]   So it started shifting to virtual classes, charging for those paying that money on to
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.360]   the gyms, not all of it.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   Because the classes that sold on its iPhone app were now virtual as opposed to real classes,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.000]   Apple says we want 30% of the sales up from zero.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.280]   And Amazon and Kindle, right?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.320]   Like Amazon.com purchases have to pay Apple nothing.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   But if you buy something for your Kindle or a Comixology, they expect they're 30% cut.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.280]   This is why these articles to me are so painful.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.720]   It's like they have an idea of the cost of the company.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.760]   Well, Apple and its defense says this is a 10 year old rule we're enforcing.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.560]   And if we waive the commission, it would not be fair to other app developers that have
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.120]   been paying that fee for 10 years for similar business.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   The thing for me is that in good times, nobody really cared about the 30%.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   It was a gold rush.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.280]   People were making money hand over fist.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.160]   You saw articles about this game making a million dollars and there were app store
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.720]   millionaires in the headlines all over the place.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.320]   And it was objectively a more convenient arrangement than the previous web stores for
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.840]   online software.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.600]   And it was better rates than they were getting or at least the same rates that they were
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.520]   getting on those web stores and way better than retail.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.040]   And nobody cares what slice of the pie someone else is getting when that pie is growing
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   so fast.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.600]   But when that pie starts to constrict, for some reason, we all switch from, hey, how
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.040]   do we stop this and start growing the pie again to, hey, why don't I get more of your
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   slice of that pie?
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.400]   And it seems like both Apple and some developers, not all developers, but some developers are
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.800]   both saying, hey, that 30% we want more of it.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.640]   And Apple saying, hey, you're not giving us that 30%.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.800]   And it doesn't address the root issue.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   None of this stuff does.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.960]   Like I was joking about this on Twitter, but it's not a joke.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.680]   I talked to developers and they say if Apple would just do what the Google Play Store is
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   doing, it'd be fine.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.240]   And I say, well, why don't you use a Google Play Store?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.440]   And they're like, I hate it.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.520]   And it doesn't just not have the principal point of logic.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   It's Apple.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.960]   Well, I don't think the reason people are not in the Google Play Store is not because
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   they hate it.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.920]   The reason is because the Android device users apparently are not as likely to pay for stuff.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.960]   And there's much less copyright prosecution and there's a bunch of revenue in the Play Store
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.600]   and the Apple Store than there is in the Play Store.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.200]   Airbnb is in an hour.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   Hold on a second.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.640]   Airbnb analogous situation they were offering in fact happens in 2016 in person experiences
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.800]   guided tours, bar crawls, cooking classes, of course, pandemic ended that business.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.680]   So they started selling virtual versions of the same experience.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.880]   Apple said, OK, now you have to give us money.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.400]   Now apparently Apple now claims even though class pass says this isn't the case, that
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.920]   the class pass has been given to the end of the year.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.040]   Class pass said they wanted it now.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.920]   And they say we're still negotiating with Airbnb.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.640]   But of course Airbnb is big and Apple might they may have the clout to negotiate.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.600]   Apple says if they don't pay, we're going to pull their app entirely.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.280]   So go ahead and make your point now, Renee.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.360]   I just want to make sure we've got the facts of these two situations.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   Yeah, no, I think there's a lot of legitimate complaints like not allowing trials on the
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.520]   store, whether that 30% should be 10% or 15% whether there should be alternate stores,
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.400]   whether they should support full progressive web apps as an alternate, all these different
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   things.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   But none of those address the root cause of this.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.240]   These are, I think, people rearranging the deck chairs is just that so much of the software
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.280]   is now commodity that I think it requires a complete reimagination of what a store should
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   be.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   It's a decade old.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.240]   And I don't think Google's far behind on having that same problem.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.920]   We just have, we went from scarcity and highly expensive apps to abundance and apps that
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   people get angry about when, you know, when they're when they're only a dollar and we
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   have to address.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   And that's not unique to ask, but we have, they've become just the next form of content.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520]   It's going to be one.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.760]   We have to address that point.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.200]   Here's one more story from the New York Times article and it's proton mail, the encrypted
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.560]   Swiss email app.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.680]   There's chief executive Andy Yen said, if you're not in the app store today, you're
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.240]   not online, your business cannot function.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   So they're the gatekeepers of something every single company wants.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.480]   But if you're going to go through those gates, they're going to charge you 30%.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.560]   So what proton mail is they began charging 30% more for subscriptions bought on the iPhone
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:37.840]   app versus those bought on the website to in effect passing Apple's fee on to the customers.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.800]   But Apple's rules prohibit proton mail saying there's a lower price on the web.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.760]   And when proton mail did that, Apple restricted its app.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.120]   Then when the company instead tried to make it clear that 30% of the subscription price
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:00.200]   went to Apple, Apple again said you can't tell people that and restricted the app again.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.720]   So there are two issues.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.920]   One is Apple seems somewhat capricious in the enforcement of these rules.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.000]   And that's a big issue.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.520]   I'll channel Alex Lindsey because you know, last time we talked about this, Alex was very
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.440]   adamant in his defensive Apple.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.560]   He said they've created the iPhone, they've created this store, they've created an immense
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.920]   value.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.800]   This is the cost of doing business.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.400]   You're riding on Apple's value.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.440]   If you want to ride on that, you don't have to.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.640]   You can go in the Android store, but if you want to ride on Apple's value, you've got
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.280]   to pay the ticket.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.560]   And so, you know, I'm not sure I agree with that, but I'll just give you Alex's point
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   of view.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.240]   What's wrong with Apple saying, look, we're providing this value.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.000]   This is what it costs.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   How about you, Lori?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What's your thought?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.080]   There's so much to unpack here.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   So I mean, you can look at it from Apple's perspective, which is exactly what Alex Lindsey
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.480]   would say, which is we have provided this value and the fee for our value is that you
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.600]   pay 30% of your profits.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.480]   That makes sense from a business point of view.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.880]   The bigger and more important your company is, the more leverage you have to make sure
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.320]   that you continue to make that growth happen for you.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   From the developer perspective, I can see, and I think this is where the, like Renee was
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.840]   saying, people didn't complain about the cost before and now they're complaining about
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   it.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.560]   I think what that more than anything comes down to is that when the App Store first started,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.440]   it was just an app.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.000]   You know, so developers, they made an app and you bought an app and that's all you bought.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   You bought this like piece of paper, right?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.320]   Now people are selling services.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.000]   They're putting services on the App Store.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So now you can, you know, you can go rent an Airbnb or you can take an in person, have
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.400]   an in person experience.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.220]   Now it's turned into a virtual experience.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.200]   This isn't just one app that you, you know, you charge $1.99 for knowing that some percentage
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.520]   of that is going to go to Apple.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:17.080]   This is your entire weekly, monthly, daily livelihood that is now 30% of your entire income
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.960]   for your life goes toward Apple, not just one purchase.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:28.400]   So I think that's part of why there's a lot more complaints going out is that it feels
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.200]   more of an, like it's having more of an effect because it's not just developers creating
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.040]   apps that we buy and 30% of it goes to Apple.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.000]   It's now, I created an app.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.440]   Apple doesn't want 30% of that.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   That's a free app.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.240]   It's the fact that you can, you know, take a scooter down the street that Apple wants 30%
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   of.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.560]   And that's where things get a little bit weird.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   And where I think, I do think Apple needs to make some changes into how it deals with
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   that kind of thing.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.520]   Like, for example, just an average standard subscription to Netflix, let's say, it starts
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.000]   at 30% at the beginning, but then goes down to 15 or 10%.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.840]   The longer that app is in the app store and in terms of services, I think something similar
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.160]   should also be in play here, which is at first your brand new customer, you have to give
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.720]   us 30% of that, but then over time, that percentage goes down.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.200]   That to me just makes, it makes sense in that apps usually get their biggest push right
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.600]   when they first come out, you know?
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.680]   So that's where a lot of money is made is right up front when all of the marketing gets
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.840]   talked about.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.160]   And two, Apple should consider and they don't have to.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   But just for society's sake, they should consider moving toward reducing how much they take from
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.680]   companies as those apps are in the app store.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.720]   Apple has been willing to kind of change its rules over time.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.880]   They were first publicly published in 2010.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:10.880]   In 2018, Microsoft came to them for Minecraft because they wanted to make sure that users
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.080]   who were able to buy a mine like me bought my Minecraft subscription years ago on the
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:24.040]   website from Mojang should be able to use Minecraft on the app store.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.880]   So Phil Schiller gave an interview to Reuters today.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.560]   I think to set the tone for tomorrow's testimony for Tim.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.080]   These are the talking points.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.920]   He said to Reuters, as we're talking to some of the biggest game developers for instance
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.120]   Minecraft, they said.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.680]   I totally get why you want the user to be able to pay for it on device.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.920]   But we have a lot of users coming in who bought their subscription or their account somewhere
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   else.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.200]   And it's a big barrier to getting into your store.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.440]   So Schiller said we created an exception to our own rule because we thought, yes, that's
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440]   reasonable.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.080]   Here's the kind of the money quote from that Reuters interview.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   This is Phil Schiller.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.360]   One of the things we came up with is we're going to treat all apps in the app store the
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.460]   same.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.920]   We've been set of rules for everybody.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.320]   No special deals, no special terms, no special code.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.240]   Everything applies to all the developers the same.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.040]   That's not the case in PC software.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   Nobody thought like that.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.720]   It was a complete flip around of how the whole system was going to work.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.120]   I have to point out that there are exceptions.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.560]   Amazon famously just got an exception as it has a French broadcaster and another broadcaster.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.180]   So they do make exceptions sometimes.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.820]   Amazon is a pretty big customer.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.340]   Amazon is a variety of deals with Apple.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.420]   So maybe that isn't completely level playing field.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.820]   And maybe this is just not the right way to do it.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:57.660]   This is an experiment in this, even though the app store has been around for 10, 12 years,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.580]   however long it's been around, it's still an experiment in figuring out how to do it
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.640]   and just because Apple decided not to do it the way PC software did it doesn't mean
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.320]   it's the right thing to do.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.000]   Maybe go back to the way PC software did it.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.440]   I think it's important to be a sort of ever changing way of doing things and listening
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.760]   to your clients and making decisions based off of that.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:33.640]   On the one hand, the iPhone is hugely popular and just like that article was saying that
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.880]   you can't be a player, you can't be a player app developer without being in the app store.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.760]   But in the reverse, one of the reasons why the iPhone is so important is developers and
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.600]   what they brought to the Apple community.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.960]   If it weren't for the app store, an iPhone would be just like an Android.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   >> That's a very good point.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.140]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.300]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   >> So the should be able to give them the type.

[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   and when they set 30% as the price that people are willing to put up with
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   it's not as though people had competition and the price got driven down to 12%
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   it's that everybody just simply decided that okay that seems to be the standard amount
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   so I don't think that report that's that's the real ask
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   I remember they were asked that and as impossible it is to believe for those of us here
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   apparently Nokia and the first app store in 1812 and it was also at 30%
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.300]   well
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   Ben Thompson also says they should ask why should apps installed by the app store not be allowed
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   to link to a webpage if that webpage allows users to sign up for a paid service
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   Ben has a very interesting solution to this like he believes that if Apple just allowed that
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   like just allowed the alternate payments that it would make all of these problems disappear
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   and granted that a lot of people has like if they just allowed sideloading if they just
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   but this to me sounds like a very reasonable solution because it protects the
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   the trust relationship the security the review process everything
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   and I don't think Apple would stand to lose that much because they would be forced to
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   compete on convenience which still is a yeah and some people just don't trust those processes like
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.180]   I'm not going to give my information to some wacky website I'm using Apple
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:22.180]   that's exactly even Apple brings that up specifically and I'm sure Tim Cook will tomorrow
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.180]   that we're providing security we use Apple we have a payment system
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.180]   so we provide a payment system which normally costs people money anyway
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   and we provide the privacy and security our users want I think you know if they said
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.180]   you can buy it here it's convenient it's easy it's one button or
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.180]   you double tap and you bought it and it's secure and you trust us
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.180]   or if you want here's the link to the web store good luck
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:50.180]   and by the way I don't think it would hurt them and they could only use them
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.180]   you could mandate the price is the same right?
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.180]   it would be harder for the store like I also think it doesn't have to be like because you're
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.180]   it's well if I'm going to pay 30% less if I buy it on the web I'm going to do that
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.180]   well but I think that's would force Apple to compete to to radically rethink those margins
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.180]   like that cut if it was an open competition for the business oh
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:16.180]   I think that solves everybody's problems good point but it would cost Apple in the long run wouldn't it?
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:22.180]   if they make a great service I mean that's the whole thing it's like why I'm so happy about default apps on iOS because
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:28.180]   I'm not using mail because I have to I'm using it because I want to that means that mail team better work right?
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:34.180]   why he says why can't Spotify and Kindle link to their web pages for purchases
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.180]   does Apple Music or Apple Books pay a 30% charge on every purchase?
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:46.180]   if so how is that charge accounted for? if not why would Spotify and Kindle have to pay Apple 30%
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.180]   on in app purchases?
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   I think and then he goes on with other stuff he says for instance iOS 14 is going to allow users to change the default web browser
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   and default email client but why not the SMS client?
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.180]   I doubt very much the senators will be asking the members of the congress will be asking if I was in my to ask the music client because
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   the SMS client is not really workable but the music client certainly is
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.180]   why does Apple allow WeChat to have a store like interface for many apps
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.180]   but doesn't allow Facebook, Microsoft, Steam or other US companies to do it
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   I wonder if they really hope that none of the more litigate
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   the younger more tech savvy more litigation savvy Congress women in particular and men don't reach their tech career
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.180]   those questions will be brought up
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.180]   yeah because we're joking around about this but this isn't like 90 minutes
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.180]   so like this isn't on the big stage at a tech conference this is they got
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.180]   them all day this could go into the early evening also this is at the end of
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   over a year of investigation subpoenas of and
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.180]   requesting and demanding documents and interviews of people so
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.180]   yes there are going to be people who are going to be grandstanding yes they're going to be asked
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   what is it that why do you hate freedom so much mr. Zuckerberg
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.180]   but there's also going to be an enough for you to make money off of it
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.180]   like the big pucker moment is going to be the question that begins
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:16.180]   in October of 2011 sir you had a meeting with the following to oh geez
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.180]   well it's going to be interesting so here's
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.180]   here's on who's on the committee Jerry Nadler leads it
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.180]   of course the democrat and there are a couple of you mentioned the democratic women
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.180]   per milla jiapar by japal and val demings
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   marigay scannelland lussey mcbath but on the
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.180]   on the republican side you got james sense and brener you got matt gates which is going to be
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.180]   interesting because he's of course one of the
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.180]   members of congress who's been most actively criticizing social media for
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.180]   its anti-conservative bias so this is seems smart but he seems to
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.180]   there seems to be like a lot of these politicians on both sides when you see them
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.180]   interviewed they are so calm so rational they seem to have all their logic sensors
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   in force and then you put them in front of like a news camera at a at a capital and they say the most
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.180]   outlandish things and I honestly don't know which one of them are going to show up on any given day
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.180]   it's such a whiplash I can't imagine having to like have your lives
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   depending on a lot of these welcome to america okay well they
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.180]   they can they can do both they can they can do service to to the party
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   as in be good little soldiers but they can also ask the pointed questions that result in this specific legislation being put through two years from now
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.180]   I think honestly the question is to the facebook the questions to amazon
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   google and facebook will be much more pointed
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:38.180]   than they will well I think this there is so much there is so many problems with facebook that if they wasted on
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   why are you biased against my right anti-vax you know that gates will it'll be horrible you know that gets us totally
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:51.180]   yeah it's it's sad yeah I mean these people could these these they are doing such a
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:56.180]   egregious thing like we saw that whole study come out where facebook knew that if they pushed extremist
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.180]   views they would hurt people but make more money and they chose to make more money
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:08.180]   and I want them asked about that not about why like fragile people who say bad things get their posts taken down or you know it's just it's heartbreaking
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:14.180]   if you look at the market cap and the value generated by these four companies
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:20.180]   this is these are huge and you know in a way
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:28.180]   you know five trillion dollar market cap for those four companies annual revenue close to a trillion
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:34.180]   seven hundred seventy three billion dollars they have four to twenty billion dollars in cash
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   that's just basil stick home yeah so they these are immensely powerful companies and while on the one hand you might say well that's why we've got to regulate them on the other hand you could also say these are the engines of the u.s. economy
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:57.180]   that's the danger here that's what happened with Microsoft that's why I'm so scared here because the the u.s. administration tends to favor low prices above the
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:09.180]   low prices above everything else and we saw that with the ebooks case we saw that with Microsoft the EU tends to favor competition and neither of them seem to have a balanced view or an astute understanding of the nuances and subtleties involved
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   and it really is a sledgehammer approach which is why I think these companies are just out of their collective minds to let it get this far.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:36.180]   Well what was the really have well they can be a little more consider they could stick or a little more like like I think Twitter might not be the perfect example but I think there's a lot of stuff that Zuckerberg could do just for the sheer betterment of humanity that would also put him on the right side of regulators
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:52.180]   and I think the app store and you know Amazon could decide not to be terrible to the people who are for them. I mean there's a lot of things just morally ethically beyond avoiding regulation that they could have been a plant that would also happen to help them with regulation
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:41:14.180]   and that's why I think the one big one that really for the for these for guys is that because of coronavirus they get to do this remotely they don't get they have that picture of like them lining up in their suits being sworn in being photographed everywhere
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:24.180]   just like the banking industry was forced to do just like the tobacco industry was forced to do it makes them look a lot less like arraigned criminals like criminals.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:33.180]   Remember all the heat the motor the big four automakers got when they flew their private jets to Washington DC don't wait for the translation answer the question.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:49.180]   Yeah. Yeah. Have you no decency. Speak into the machine. Oh no that's another one. Don't wait for the translation. I forget who it was but it might have been a AOC made of somebody else who was just skewering Zuckerberg like he was sitting there looking
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:42:00.180]   paler and paler and sweatier and sweatier and they were just drilling down into his soul and those are the kind of moments we won't get because I'm sure his zoom call will fail. You know whatever it has to.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:14.180]   Yeah no I'm serious I mean if I if I had tele powers of teleportation and visibility. I would love to see. I'm not joking here I'm sure that each one of these CEOs is going to be.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:31.180]   chatting in from something akin to a sound stage where they've built like an office that just like I just Dean has just like all these other streamers have the fake like house but on the other sides of it there are going to be two dozen people who are just there with
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:42.180]   big pads of paper and big iPads to like write down. I see where this is going here's a piece of piece of data that you need is there a lawyer in frame with them. Like how do they do the pause hold on it's like how do they have that's really interesting.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:53.180]   I don't know why I don't know because that's what you need to get to get a week off the clock right. Yeah well no they can they can they can hit the mute button and maybe they can also do like and so Mr Zuckerberg.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:43:05.180]   I'm not given this given this that you were the were active you've actively trying to be being bring down bringing down our federal government by these sworn statements what have you to say.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.180]   You're muted.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:16.180]   So much you're muted sir. You're watching these delightful cats we'll try to fix this. I will be I will be watching this I don't.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:21.180]   I don't know why I'm not going to be a
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.180]   good guy.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:46.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:12.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.180]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   There's so much senators.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.180]   These guys might be a little savvier.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.180]   I think a lot of young Congress people are just savviest.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.180]   Let's hope.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.180]   You said noon?
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.180]   Is that noon Eastern Andy?
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.180]   noon Eastern time I don't understand.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.180]   I might have to come in early just so we can watch along.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   Are you going to scream at Leo?
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   I think we might have to go to C-Span and stream along.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   I don't know.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.180]   I'll come in here and we'll start it.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.180]   If you and Micah wear it, do it with hats, I will definitely be with you.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.180]   Oh, you're in floss.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:16.180]   The real stories are going to come out about this on Thursday, not live on Wednesday, because
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:22.180]   there's going to be, this is an opportunity to get the shot of asking the serious question
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.180]   and getting the immediate reaction.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:31.180]   But it's also, again, hours and hours and hours of essentially laying lines of bait that they're going to be
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.180]   following up on two or three months later.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.180]   Well, and remember what happened with Mark Zuckerberg at least 30 or 40 times.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.180]   He said, I'll have to get back to you on that.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.180]   I'll have my, you know, and I suspect we'll see that strategy again as well.
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.180]   Should the bees be capitalized in Facebook?
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.180]   I'll have to get back to you.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   That's why it's tough for like people in our business because we were, as usual, I'm going
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   to be downloading the video.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   I'm going to be in VLC, like playing it back at double speed so I can make sure that I've,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.180]   I'm paying attention for three solid hours instead of hanging in for seven and a half hours,
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.180]   because again, it's going to be the name to you haven't heard of and something that when
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:13.180]   no one's paying attention, a very, very simple question with a very, very off-putting answer
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.180]   that results in, again, new legislation a year from half a year and a half.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   And there are some, I think some of the members of Congress are pretty sharp and we'll be asking sharp
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   questions.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   David Chisholini of Rhode Island is pretty savvy on this.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.180]   He's been very critical of Amazon.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:32.180]   I think there, I don't think this will be like the previous Senate testimony.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.180]   I think this might be a little bit more productive.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:39.180]   And this is, and this is, this is Bezos's first appearance before Congress.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.180]   Everyone else is a, is at least a two timer, I think.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.180]   Right.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180]   Ever one or two timer.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:50.180]   And this is, I mean, I totally, I, I totally agree with the guttural reaction of Renee that
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   in all the conversations about huge companies that have an immense amount of power and not
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   necessarily a great deal of responsibility and how they wield it.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.180]   I mean, Amazon is definitely it.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:06.180]   And even, even if we decide to skip ahead past all the labor abuses and we talk about why
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.180]   is it that every time anybody wants to buy something, the first, the, the first website
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:15.180]   they go to is Amazon just to find out what's available and how are they going to defend
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:20.180]   themselves against the idea that, no, no, no, I know it's incredibly valuable for us to not
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:25.180]   only see who's buying what, but what they were looking at before they decided to buy what.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.180]   And yes, I know we're now creating our own brands in order to compete with other other
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.180]   things that are available on our store, but we're not abusing our position in order to
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.180]   do so.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.180]   Yeah, we're going to trust you on that.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180]   I also think to see if anyone.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.180]   Go ahead.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.180]   I was going to say, if you're going to see if anyone plays the card, we're like, oh, you
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.180]   know, the more you regulate us, the bigger advantage you're giving Chinese companies.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.180]   And is that really in your national security interest?
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.180]   Don't you, do you really want to weaken American companies right now?
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.180]   Sure.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.180]   I'm sure about that.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.180]   And the whole thing is just so many different layers of.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:48:00.180]   I also wonder how much they're going to focus on Bezos, given how important this particular
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:05.180]   appearance is and maybe they'll be perfunctory questions for the others and just go.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.180]   And then, and now let's get down to what we really want to know from Jeff Bezos, especially
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.180]   because of Chitelini, who's running the show on this.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.180]   It will be streamed on YouTube.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:18.180]   There's a house judiciary channel on YouTube who knew.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.180]   You can, you can watch it live there again.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.180]   He's like and subscribe.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.180]   Please like it.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.180]   I'm going to hit the red bell and.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   I remember pound that like button just like a gambling you're interviewing.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.180]   Raise your right hand and slam it on that like button.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.180]   It's going to be challenging.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:42.580]   Actually, Ben had an interesting graph in his article where he shows how popular these companies
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.580]   are.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.220]   These are not, you know, you're, these, these are important brands.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.180]   And this is Google's number one with them.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:56.220]   This, this is from Vox Media, the Verge Tech Trust survey from last December.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:05.220]   Google 72% positive rating, Amazon 70% Microsoft 66% Apple 62%.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   These Facebook's a little lower.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:12.660]   Facebook has a 40% positive, 35% neutral, 25% negative.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:20.580]   But those big three Google Amazon Apple in there are extremely popular companies with
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.980]   American public.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.340]   So again, a challenge to do to handle this.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.660]   This is, I mean, I don't know whether this is an unprecedented business situation or
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.140]   a totally presidend to situation.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.220]   I have to, I have to go back to when every single industry was based on steel and steel
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:41.500]   was, were conglomerates or every time that every time someone had to move from point A
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:46.740]   to point B, they had to go with a trust based on the, based on the railroad and the, and
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.700]   the urban, the urban transport trust.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.220]   We, we, we've put so much everything Andy.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:57.940]   Well, the railroads, I doubt there was a lot of love for US steel, but the railroads
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.980]   are a good analogy because people have got real benefit from the railroads.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.460]   And I'm sure that the railroad barons face less scrutiny because.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.020]   And the telecommunication companies, we all love that.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.020]   Right.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:17.660]   Yeah, it's just that people, people can, people are capable of not trusting the power of individual
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:23.620]   CEOs at Google and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon and even Apple, while also saying,
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.460]   don't you dare take away my Google Maps?
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.260]   Don't you dare take away my Google Docs?
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.660]   Don't you dare take away my one, one ability to see, don't, don't, don't do anything to
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.660]   Instagram.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.780]   That means I can no longer like see pictures that have been sent to me by my, by my nieces
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.780]   and nephews.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:44.060]   It would be imprudent to do so now we're more reliant on these companies than ever.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.860]   You know, but not that, not the Congress doesn't do the things that they're risk.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.580]   Like this has got to be built into their risk assessments.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.940]   It's like, these are big companies.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:52.940]   They're not stupid.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.540]   And this has got to be built into their risk assessment strategies.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.100]   And there's got to be something that's telling them to hold the line on this, even when it
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.340]   looks like folly to, you know, people like me or us or whatever, I just wish I knew what
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.340]   it was.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:09.300]   Also, they also, they might be a lot of, a lot of different management teams are in a position
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:16.580]   where if there is a change of staff at the executive branch of the United States government,
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.540]   a lot of our problems could either a go away or be very so totally different that we're
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:28.020]   going to wish that we had waited until October, November, December, January 20th to make it,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.420]   make any offers of what we're willing to do to avoid being legislated.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:37.980]   Virgil in the chatroom sent me an article from 2013 when Tim Cook appeared before the
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:45.260]   Senate and received the headline is senators turned Tim Cook's hearing into a genius bar
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   visit.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:50.500]   Questions like, why the hell do I have to keep updating my apps on my iPhone all the time?
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.260]   Why don't you fix that?
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.260]   That was John McCain.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.500]   Why don't you fix that?
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.900]   Carl Levin of Michigan said, I have an iPhone in my pocket.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.220]   I have an iPad right here.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.180]   My granddaughter even knows how to use it.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:11.540]   So, but again, that's the Senate where they, I think they tend to be a little older, maybe
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.540]   a little less tech savvy.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.140]   I think Congress, again, it's not Microsoft and Intel up there.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.900]   And if you'd said that 10 years ago, nobody would have believed you.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Yeah, good point.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   Um, when Senator Kelly, I out of a New Hampshire greeted Tim Cook, she said, so nice to meet
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.900]   you.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   I'm a bad.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:37.020]   Claire McCaskill says, I love Apple.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.020]   I love Apple.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.500]   And there was a ring or switch thing too.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.380]   Wasn't there was someone complaining about the ring or switch?
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.620]   The whole thing was just, I wanted to cry.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.340]   I just wanted to cry.
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.980]   I think it's a different.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:56.060]   Yeah, again, just think about 12 to 13 months of them demanding documents interviewing people.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.700]   So, I'm simply having a, well, I'm glad you brought you in and now you can know, you can,
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.020]   can you have Steve Jobs autograph my iPhone?
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.620]   Like, no, we really can't have him do that.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.980]   This is, this is going to be a focus thing.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.940]   It's not going to be over and done with this is the first, this is the third step towards
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:16.620]   a five step process of each of these companies probably having to concede something major.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.900]   I'll say that, but it's rumors US Congress, we can move on.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.340]   Rumors started to appear about iPhone 12.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:29.220]   I don't know, I always go to Renee Richie to vet those.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.460]   Are any of these rumors worth paying attention to or?
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.660]   So I worked in this industry for 10 years.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.420]   My delightful colleague, Lori Gilstil, works there and I understand that news is hard right
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.460]   now, but I look out of the landscape and it says, "Leak confirms iPhone 12, Apple September
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.460]   event."
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.380]   And I look and it's a Twitter account that has never tweeted before that has an an emoji
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:54.780]   or not necessarily an anime picture as its icon and just says things that are either
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:59.700]   patently obvious or so far outlandish and it gets an entire article.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.860]   I got eight different sites and I just, I get it.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:07.220]   We're all super bored right now, but the, I think you should better prepare people for
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.620]   like, this is a zany Twitter account that's just tweeting stuff and we're desperate and
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.580]   not, oh my God, this is what the next iPhone is going to be.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:20.660]   Japanese site, Mac Otakara says there might be a delay for the iPhone 12 to late October
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.620]   due to COVID-19 and hitting the supply chain.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.100]   That's, I don't know how well sourced it is, but it's not hard to believe.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:35.620]   But then there's rumor that the Apple event will still take place when it usually does
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.620]   in early September.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.820]   That's just when we see the phones won't be.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.020]   And they did that with the 10R right?
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.060]   They announced it, they showed it and they said, and you'll get it late October.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.780]   And the 10 in the, the 8th, the 8th, the right.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:53.380]   The difference this time though is that normally when they have a September event, it's a week
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.060]   or two weeks later, something is in people's hands.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:01.220]   And in this case, if they actually do a September event and they don't postpone the event a
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:09.260]   month, we're going to see, you know, the, the announcement and then a delay, which I wonder,
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.460]   is that a good idea?
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:15.780]   Because part of why we jump out and buy these new iPhones is that they just had an announcement
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.340]   that following Friday, you can pre-order it the following Friday after that, you get
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.260]   to see it's in your hands.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.100]   There's that kind of excitement that happens right away.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:30.060]   So I wonder, you know, is it from a marketing perspective, is it a good idea for Apple to
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.300]   have their September event like they always do?
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:39.420]   Or is it smarter to postpone the event until they know that they can ship those iPhones
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.860]   two weeks after that event?
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.780]   That to me, that makes the most sense.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.940]   It's a virtual event though.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.700]   Like that's the thing with these, all these things is it's a virtual event.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.140]   They could very well have planned.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.460]   They have the iPhone event the exact same week on the exact, like Tuesday of the exact same
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.020]   week every year.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.500]   It's not like rocket science to predict when the next one could be.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.380]   And in a normal year, that could absolutely be the event.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.460]   But when it's virtual, they can hold it anytime they want.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.940]   And we saw what WWDC was three weeks later than it usually is.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.540]   And that, they could just say, this is what we're going to do.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.020]   We're not going to have any more air power nonsense going on.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.540]   That stuff stopped.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.020]   And when we know what's going to ship and we know when it's going to ship, we're going
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.180]   to have the event two weeks before that.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.580]   And these are all the ways we're going to work with people who aren't there in person,
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.740]   but we still build exciting.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.180]   That to me smells like Apple.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.700]   It doesn't smell like Apple to go, okay, we decided three years ago, this was the date
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.900]   and we're just going to do it because we decided it.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.900]   >> Right.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:30.900]   >> Right.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.740]   >> It's hard to say though, because I don't think any company is as much of a control
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.500]   freak about their marketing as Apple is.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.500]   And they're the great thing about this in person.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.060]   >> They wish they were.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.900]   >> Well, no.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.860]   Do they miss hear you?
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:53.180]   >> Other companies wish that they were as good as Apple at being so tight about it.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.740]   >> No, no, I don't mean that way.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:57:00.540]   I mean that they like having absolute control over every step and how information gets out,
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:06.460]   who gets it, how these people release that information, make sure that they are being,
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:13.300]   I wouldn't say influenced, but make sure that if there are any mistakes in coverage or if
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.580]   anything that Apple assumed was going to happen as a result of this doesn't happen,
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.140]   there's going to be a course correction there.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:25.380]   And it makes their jobs a lot tougher because they're certainly, the great things about
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:31.140]   having those in person events is that you have the three or four different layers of
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.700]   hand holding that go on there.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:39.980]   And also the other X factor here is that I don't know if I 100% believe that Apple's
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:45.740]   going to show off at least Apple Glass sometime before the end of the year, but how are they,
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:50.540]   it's the sort of thing where it's very, very hard for them to stream a video of someone
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:57.300]   using this and communicate without live audience reaction, how interesting this is and what
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.340]   the message story is behind this.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:05.060]   And also, how do they, this is also the sort of thing where, oh boy, if you've got a whole
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:11.500]   bunch of training before you got to a pre-release iPhone with a new feature on it, imagine they're
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.260]   probably going to put you into like two weeks, forget to coronavirus quarantine, they're
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:20.140]   going to put you in Apple Glass quarantine where you can't leave the hotel for two weeks.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.860]   So that's so personal that they're enforcer.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.860]   Exactly.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:31.060]   I mean, it's going to, that's going to be a really, really tough thing.
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:35.700]   It's because that would have been, it would have been almost like the iPad introduction
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:42.420]   where boy, all you want is as an Apple PR person is get all these people into the demo
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:48.780]   room and let them scroll, let them squeeze, let them see how well, how light this thing
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:53.500]   is and how durable it feels like when they don't have the ability to let these people
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.460]   who are going to be the first round of influencers, the people who are going to do the hey guys,
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.100]   they got my first full hands on in depth review here in the demo room where I have two minutes
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.100]   with this thing.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:06.460]   But all this sort of stuff where people are saying, I know I don't have them yet, I know
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.820]   I don't have a full review, but even for the first two minutes of this, I can tell this
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.260]   is something different and something special.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.860]   There are a lot of variables here.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:22.100]   As is the slogan for 2020, this is a unprecedented situation and we can't really predict how anybody
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.700]   is going to get through anything.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:33.740]   People announced last month at the virtual WWDC that they were going to allow fine-minded
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:41.980]   work with other companies, but now the Washington Post has a, sorry?
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.980]   This was the dumbest article.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   Oh, good.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.980]   All right.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   I'll let you puncture this.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.860]   Let me tell you what they said.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:55.820]   They said they have a secret Apple document that says that there are some limitations to
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:01.380]   what third parties can do with fine-my chiefly and it's a 50-page PDF, which no one's read
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.380]   except the Washington Post.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:08.060]   Chiefly, let's put restrictions on how consumers will be able to use the app.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:14.140]   Apple customers who use fine-my to locate a device will be barred from using other competing
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.300]   services simultaneously.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.660]   So that's a really ignorant way of explaining.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.140]   I'm not usually this ambient-by-articles because I figured they're just insane, but
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.860]   this is the same thing we saw happen with HomeKit where there was like two years of bashing
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.740]   articles and it turns out the whole reason was that because accessory makers were upset
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.060]   they had to use secure Wi-Fi.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.220]   It was inconvenient for them, even though it was way better for us.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:39.260]   So my understanding is that- I don't even understand how Apple could do that.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.140]   Why couldn't I use a tile if- So you can.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.900]   So that's why the article is so badly written.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.660]   So there's an NDA on this that's- I haven't seen it.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.460]   I've talked to people who've seen it that it's basically the same as the Secure HomeKit
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.580]   NDA and the MFI NDA, which is the hardware stuff is always more stringent than the software
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.940]   stuff because they don't want you to like take it and then just go make your own.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.220]   So it's got more legal language in it to just protect the IP.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.660]   But you can use a tile and you can use fine-my.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.020]   That is no problem.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.780]   What you can't do is use- Apple doesn't want to mingle secure with non-secure services.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.540]   So anybody else can use fine-my with their app and you can use their app instead.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.780]   But you can't use fine-my through fine-my and their app at the same time because Apple
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.020]   can't verify the security status.
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.180]   And they want you to know if you're using fine-my there's no tracking, there's no location being
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.980]   stored and all those things may not be true with another app.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.020]   So basically you opt out of fine-my and use fine-my through that app instead.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.020]   Clarify this for me.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.540]   So we talked about this on iOS today.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.980]   I want to see if we guessed right because you're right.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   That's unclear from the article.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980]   I'm a headphone maker.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:50.220]   I put fine-my in my headphones, which is be great, right?
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.340]   So, and I don't know if that means there's a U1 chip in there so I would hope that would
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.140]   include that so I could aim my iPhone.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.140]   It doesn't have to.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.140]   That'd be nice.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.140]   Anyway.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.140]   No, it can.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   It just doesn't have to.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   Okay.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   So somehow I'll be able to find my headphones.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.540]   Does that mean I cannot attach a tile device to the headphones?
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   No, you're going to find a tile.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.540]   Of course I can't.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.540]   Absolutely.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.540]   Right?
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.540]   Yes.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.580]   So those headphones can't build in both tile capability and fine-my capabilities.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.820]   No, they can do that too.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.260]   What it means is that, yeah, so the headphone maker has the option of using fine-my without
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.740]   the fine-my app.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.180]   You just can't use both together.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:27.140]   When you opt into the fine-my app, it puts you in a secure state so that, you know, like
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.460]   there's zero tracking, there's none of those things.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.420]   Apple can't verify that the headphone maker is doing the same thing.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:38.540]   So if you turn on the headphone makers, the fine-my apps part stops working.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.380]   It's the same like when you used to do iMessage and you would iMessage telephone number and
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.500]   it would split into a new thread because Apple no longer could guarantee that the original
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.140]   thread was secure anymore.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.020]   So it's only with the fine-my network.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:54.260]   You can use tile as much as you want and they can use tile as much as they want.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.860]   That seems completely reasonable.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.860]   Yes.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.140]   It doesn't really limit the headphone manufacturer from doing whatever they want.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:10.100]   The only limit is you can't use an insecure system at the same time as using fine-my.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.140]   You have to choose which app you want to own fine-my for those headphones basically.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.820]   Oh, so you can even use fine-my for the tile.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.180]   I don't know if tile is going to implement it.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.380]   If tile did, theoretically, you could.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.300]   But you'd have to choose, yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like you can't have two default
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   browsers.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.300]   You got to pick your default browser.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.300]   That makes sense.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.300]   But you still could pick.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.300]   Yes.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.860]   Both the customer and the manufacturer.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.060]   So I don't see how this is monopolistic in any form or fashion.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.060]   No.
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.060]   The whole article's terrible.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.500]   It gets worse as it goes down.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   Okay.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   Thank you for clearing that up.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.260]   No, it's fine.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.580]   I just, like, again, it's, I understand there are manufacturers who find some of this inconvenient
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:52.140]   and there's never been a headline that the Washington, which I forget which Washington
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.140]   this is.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.140]   As in the post.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.140]   We saw the same thing with HomeKit.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.980]   And the convenience and security are different odds.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.660]   And sometimes you sacrifice some convenience to have some security.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.220]   But you totally get to choose.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:09.140]   It's not helpful for the, for the post to do this because, you know, consumers want choice.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.220]   But I know they also want security.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:15.740]   And if you couch this as, look, your choice is going to be limited because you want more
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.940]   security.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:22.700]   That's a different thing from saying, oh, no, this is all about Apple wanting monopoly.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.020]   That's not this at all.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020]   No.
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020]   All right.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020]   So thank you for clearing that up.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.240]   No, I was, I was going to say something about it, but I didn't see that many people talking
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.620]   about the article and I didn't want to give it that much attention.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.700]   But a lot of people just bought it.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.900]   Like they didn't bother to check and it took me like, I don't know, I had to read through
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.900]   it.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.500]   It took me 20 minutes to ask people, you know, who make this kind of stuff.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   What does this mean?
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:52.740]   Beta three developers are going to get beta three of iOS 14 or they are getting it now.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:57.700]   I got beta two public beta, which I have to say I'm very happy with, although there are
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.680]   some weird flaws for some reason, my clock widget.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.820]   I was all excited about the clock widget.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.380]   Doesn't seem to keep time though.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.380]   Whoops.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.540]   Sounds like they made a widget, but they didn't connect it to the clock.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.540]   Can I show you something really quick?
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.540]   Yes.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.540]   Yes.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.780]   This is my tiny iPhone SE running the beta of iOS 14.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780]   No room for icons.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   I think it's so cute.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.820]   No room for icons.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.460]   Those widgets fit on there.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:28.220]   So I have thought, oh, it's so bad because you can't put any widgets on or you don't
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.780]   get to put very many.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.120]   You actually can only fit two rows though.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.960]   So I have two small ones on the top row and then one on the medium one on the second
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.960]   row.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.360]   You can't fit more than that.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.600]   Even if they were the small ones, you could still only fit two rows.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:51.320]   But what I realized I really like about it is compared to the size of an icon on a standard
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.480]   iPhone.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.400]   It's so small and it's busy, but I can make page after page of nothing but widgets.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.420]   These big widgets and that can be my home screen pages and they're big and easy to see.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.180]   And the smart stacks will actually flip.
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:14.300]   I actually ended up really liking it on the tiny screen as opposed to being frustrated
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.020]   that it doesn't fit more on it.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:23.300]   You're a little more selective about what you put on each screen that has a widget because
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.260]   you can only fit two rows of them.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.340]   I'll give you a really nice tip that I can't remember where I found it, but I really like
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   it.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.900]   So the series suggestions widgets nice, especially for the home screen because it suggests apps
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.300]   that you've used recently or you use a lot or timely.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:44.220]   What I didn't know is you could put two series suggestion widgets one above the other and
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.020]   they show different icons.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:52.460]   So I'm thinking that what is actually happening is instead of getting the most eight top picks,
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:59.540]   I'm getting the 16 top picks, which means this can be my home screen because it's always
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.620]   changing home screen, but it's the apps that I use the most.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.540]   I think that's really interesting.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.540]   I do that too.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.980]   And at first, I wasn't sure if I'd like it because it does take you like the apps aren't
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:10.980]   in the same place every time.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.660]   It does take you a second to find the app, but they're almost the app I want is like
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.540]   99 out of 100 times there.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540]   Yes.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.020]   It takes me a second to find it and that's so much faster than paging or using spotlight.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.260]   So I now have three pages.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:29.180]   I have that home page with I have the smart stack, then two series suggestions.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.540]   I don't know if you could fit that on an SE.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.540]   Maybe you could.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540]   I don't know.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.540]   I'll try it while you're talking.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:39.180]   Then the next page is my the folders I use by my organization.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.940]   So I know if I don't see it right there and I don't want to search, I can switch to a
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.380]   static list of things I want.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.220]   And then the third actually the third page is more widgets.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.820]   The fourth page is this whatever they call the app library, which I rarely get to.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.740]   I usually find what I want on page one or two.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.500]   It's way better than I thought it would be.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   It is.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   Yeah, that they've nailed.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.660]   And I heard you with Micah talking about this smart stack.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:10.300]   I think the thing that's holding it back there is that apps have to like if the counter
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.620]   appointment is coming up, it will switch to calendar, but the apps can also alert to
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.620]   a change of status and pushing it.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:18.620]   And I think those apps just aren't doing a great job of updating it.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.460]   It's supposed to be like a storyline.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.060]   And you can inject into the storyline.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.260]   And I think they're not doing that like optimally at all yet.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.940]   And I did take off the clock widget because I could just never it was very confused.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.940]   It's a static image.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.820]   I don't know why there's a clock widget because it doesn't update every second.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.580]   It updates when it needs to.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.580]   It's so weird.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.580]   It was.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.340]   So you can use the series suggestion widgets on you can fit to the two of them and it will
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   show you this dynamic.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.340]   Isn't that wild?
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.340]   And ban apps from it.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.340]   You don't like them.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   Can you ban apps?
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340]   Can you say don't ever tell me that one?
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.940]   Yeah, you can hold down on one of the apps and then say don't ever show this up to me.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.440]   Oh, nice.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.060]   I'm sorry, but I'm going to banish you grindstone.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.060]   Don't suggest it.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.060]   That's it.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.060]   Done.
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.420]   No more suggest because I'm done with the game.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.900]   I don't want to see it anymore.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.940]   It shows it because I played it off a lot.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.220]   So yeah, I would really love it if that smart stack were a little smarter.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.220]   That's what we were talking about.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:14.580]   And when third party wages come up like when carrot weather is in there and a bunch of
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.860]   other apps is going to be delightful.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   That'll happen.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   I keep telling myself that.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.860]   Yeah, that'll happen.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.380]   Get insulted every time you wake up your phone really looking forward to paying for that.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:26.140]   Hey, God, I'm using your phone again.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.820]   Make your friends.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.220]   Let's see.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.460]   What else is going on?
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.460]   There is a bug.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.820]   I haven't come across this, but I'm more had the story.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:35.820]   So I know it's important.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:45.140]   Oliver wrote Apple introduced a bug with 10 dot 15 dot six that's killing virtual machines.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.340]   If you're running virtualization apps, your Mac may crash.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.260]   VMware says it's Apple's fault.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.660]   There isn't a workaround yet.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.340]   I'm sure they'll fix it.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.660]   That's why these are betas.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.340]   Well is 10, 15 and six a beta?
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   No, that's not big.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.900]   Oh, this one isn't about the beta.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.620]   Oh, yeah, that's Carolina.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.620]   Yeah, that's the.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.500]   That's why we need betas.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   Sorry.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.340]   The Pokemon go is still crashing on iOS 14 and I'm really salty about it.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.420]   I am I have not gone a big circus.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:20.780]   I want reliability, but I recently decided perhaps foolishly that I should have every
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.420]   photo I've ever taken in Apple's photos app.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.420]   Bless you, Leo.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.860]   That seems like it was a bad idea.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:34.100]   Over 65,000 photos and it just crashes every time and reboots the whole machine.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.780]   Oh, God.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.980]   It's not just like I photo like photos crashed.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:43.980]   I come back, you know, because I'm importing them and I come back and the machine's been
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   rebooted.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980]   It's like I didn't do that.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:46.980]   It's probably the demon, right?
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:47.980]   The demon of the photos.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.180]   I forget its name now, but photo something demon.
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.660]   It's obviously got there's too many photos.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:11:00.060]   Yeah, I really wish I could get back to a level of trust with my Mac where I will let
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.780]   it have any access to my music or any access to my music to my photos or any other piece
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   of media.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:10.460]   It seems to be historically they will find a way to screw it up.
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:15.180]   What is just this is a complete side note.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:18.420]   And I know Andy you're a serious photographer.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.540]   I don't want to use Lightroom to manage my library anymore.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.180]   I would love to use I photos.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.940]   That was my thinking, but I have too many photos for it.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.780]   It's not aperture though.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780]   It's not aperture.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   I know that much.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:38.100]   Is there a good digital asset management tool for photos on the Mac?
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.980]   The best one I've encountered is oddly enough Adobe Bridge where it's not like Lightroom
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.060]   was trying to.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:54.860]   I'm using for long term storage, just dumping them folder by folder to my server.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:02.340]   I keep them backed up as basically folders full of files, basically images of 64 gig memory
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.340]   cards.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:08.180]   And then I can annotate them using Adobe Bridge whenever I want to find the picture that I
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.980]   now want to process in another app.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.420]   I will use Bridge as a front end to that.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:16.340]   There's some open source tools that I kind of like too, but none of them as much as I
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:21.740]   would like to say, oh, the thing is subscription based software, it's very anti-cons and then
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:25.300]   I'm trying to find something that works as well as Bridge and I can't.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.180]   So okay, I'll see Bridge.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.140]   Wasn't Affinity making one or made one?
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   I forget.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.060]   There was some third big third party company that was making one.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:38.180]   The Skylem, the Luminar folks said they were going to do it.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:41.060]   And they sort of have, but not really.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:46.460]   I have to ask my photographer friends what they use because I know they prefer Macs.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.580]   I was hoping the iPhoto's would work because then it would back up to iCloud.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.300]   It just seemed like it was a kind of a nice.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.860]   Are you sure that it won't work?
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.740]   You just got to give it a little time to actually load them all?
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.460]   Well, and then it's got another problem because it seems to be.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:06.380]   I'm very careful that the exit information and the file name and the creation and modification
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.020]   date all match the actual photo date.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   But I will just be difficult.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:16.340]   Photo seems to think now everything was July 12, 2020.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.020]   It drives me crazy.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.220]   I found some really nice command line tools.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.700]   There's J-Head, there's XIF tool.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.540]   There's some really good command line tools that let you fix all this.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.180]   In fact, I went through every photo.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.660]   XIF tool does it for raws as well as JPEGs.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:42.060]   Changed the file name to reflect the date of capture, changed the creation date and modification
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.460]   date to reflect the date of capture, and then even sorted it into folders year, month,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.460]   day folders.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.460]   It's beautiful.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.620]   Grand Gem and I too got rid of all the dupes.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.660]   I thought I was doing it perfectly and then I photos goes, "Yeah, it's all July 12."
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:56.660]   It's a soup.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.340]   Gus Mueller has an amazing app for batching photos too.
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.340]   If you ever...
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.820]   Oh, for those of you who aren't as adept at the...
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.780]   I'm blanking on the name, but he basically spun it out of Acorn and it's brilliant for
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.780]   people who aren't as comfortable with the command line.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.100]   I love the command line.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.820]   This is what the command line's made for.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820]   Yes.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:21.540]   You have to spend some time sussing out weird command line attributes and things to make
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.740]   sure it does what...
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.740]   And of course you have to do a big testing thing.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:29.700]   Once you do it, once I got it all working, I was able to write a single script that took
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:33.900]   all day, went through everything and cleaned it all up beautifully.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.060]   Yeah, I use photo mechanic.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.940]   I own photo mechanic.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.820]   Maybe I should try that as a digital asset management tool.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:42.660]   Weirdly.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.700]   I've been trying to see what Google Photos can do for me.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.940]   Given that I almost never take...
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.820]   I really don't take many personal photos at all.
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.220]   It's mostly just going out and having fun taking pictures.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.580]   So I don't have to really worry about...
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.700]   I never want Google to have pictures of my kids' faces as they're growing up, which
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.020]   is legitimate for a lot of people.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.580]   But because I can...
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.540]   Their ability to automatically tag and identify things in photos.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.980]   And then years later to say, "Oh, I don't know where I took it."
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.460]   I took this picture of...
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:19.460]   It was like a wheat field behind a white fence and then just do a search for white fence.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.500]   And here are 11 pictures and that's number three.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.340]   But the other cool thing is after dumping...
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:29.780]   I was trying to take pictures of the comment again and failed.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:35.740]   But as usual, simply as a backup, backed up all my raw files to Google Photos.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:40.540]   And part of the fun is opening the app a day later to see if they've made anything magical
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.660]   out of what they found there.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:49.020]   I was like, "Oh, look, there's a nice picture of a two birds."
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.180]   And you can see the ripples in the water, but the birds seem to be still staying still.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.180]   That's nice.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.260]   "Hey, while look, here's an animated..."
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:03.020]   Basically I would love to see Apple do that sort of automatic tagging because I'm the
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:09.660]   idea of cataloging my pictures so well that I can always get my hands on exactly what
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.500]   I need if I don't necessarily know what date I took the picture.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.740]   That's such a big win for me that the system that allows me to simply describe a photo
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.620]   that I can sort of remember and it will find it for me.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.340]   That's sort of the defining feature for a photo organizer for me.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.260]   It's kind of a missed opportunity, I think, for Apple.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:28.260]   They've got the...
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.700]   They want services, they have the ecosystem, they have iCloud, I have photos on everything
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:36.340]   I have it on my Apple TV even.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.980]   It would be so nice if it worked.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.180]   Sorry, Lauren, go ahead.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.620]   I was just going to speak to Andy.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.380]   They do have a search feature.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.740]   Maybe you're thinking or describing something different with what Google does, but I could
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.980]   search for a fence on my photos app and it will show me all pictures that have a fence
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   in it.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980]   Is that what you're talking about?
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.980]   Really?
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   I'll try it again.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.980]   I'll try it again.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.980]   The last one is there.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:04.220]   Yeah, I think Google is probably better at it.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.220]   Google is great.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220]   It's more diverse.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.900]   Apple has pre-existing categories where Google just seems like it's learning faster
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900]   than you are.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.620]   So you could search for dogs, for instance, and you get all the dog photos.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.420]   Yes, I can't search for iPhone, which just baffles me, but fine.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   Because you're a dog.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:22.940]   Because you have too many pictures of iPhones, it's confused.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.940]   You figure out which iPhone.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.580]   You make that a category, right?
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   It's like, is it a square?
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   Does it have a black square inside?
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   It's fine.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   It's an iPhone.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:34.460]   It's even nice when it does things like whatever the service is when it can do things like
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:35.660]   that are more abstract.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.420]   Like, okay, you identified a cat in a photo.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:43.100]   I could, you know, a high schooler can use an open source framework and do that.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:50.060]   Give me the ability to say a pen and ink drawing of this.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:55.300]   So not only do you have to identify a face, but you also have to say, no, this is an,
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.980]   this is a photograph taken on an overcast, great day.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.340]   This is not a drawing.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.340]   This specifically is a line drawing.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.340]   Oh, look, there's that Andrew Zorn.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.340]   Now you're sharing me, Andy.
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.740]   You're training them to be better than us again.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.620]   Is this the app you were talking about?
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.340]   Publicspace.net better finder attributes Renee?
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340]   No.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.300]   No, it's from, it's a flying meat.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.660]   Gus Mueller's company makes it and I'll find it.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.980]   This is actually good.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.900]   It's $17.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:26.180]   I bought this and it does a similar thing to the command line, although a lot easier with
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.420]   a GUI.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:28.420]   So you can.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.260]   Retro batch.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.820]   Yeah, it's notal, of course, because it's Gus.
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:33.820]   So it's.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.500]   There are a lot of really good tools out there.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   Flying meat is great stuff.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.900]   I like people like him and Chris, I'm like his last name, the people who make accelerate
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:47.740]   engineers sort of, you know, they go to the W.C. and make the Apple engineers quake with
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:48.900]   fear over what they're building.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.100]   Oh, this is really nice.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:55.620]   This actually does more than a X if modification.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:00.140]   Your metadata is in there, but you could do, you know, color effects and all sorts of
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.140]   stuff.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.140]   Oh, I'm downloading this.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.140]   That looks great.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   Serious.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.140]   And he makes a great pizza.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.420]   So what else can you, what else do you want?
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   You can even do it.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.580]   You can even script it with JavaScript.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   Wow.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.580]   Well, he's got to make the rocket pizza oven that cooked it like 9,000 degrees or something.
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   Really?
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   Remember, we talked about it a few years ago on the show.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:24.220]   He made like an oven that was so hot you could theoretically cook the pizza of the gods.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:30.220]   RetroBatch is $30 retrobatch pro is $50.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.380]   It's all in the flying meat store.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.380]   And of course I buy every edition of Acorn.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.700]   I just think Acorn is handiest little.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.700]   It's terrific.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.580]   Do hickey out there.
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.500]   Flyingmeat.com.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.620]   Pay no attention to the website name.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.180]   A lot of it.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.900]   What else should we talk about?
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.900]   Taylor Swift's talk.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.900]   We talk about it.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.980]   Let's talk about Intel.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:59.820]   So Apple's going, Apple's going, wow.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.540]   We dodged the only reason I found out this weekend that silicon gossip is the same as
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.780]   like beauty YouTube gossip.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:11.660]   It's like every as soon as the results came in, it was like 800 videos blaming all these
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.900]   different people for what was happening.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.100]   And this was a power struggle.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.660]   And that person was being forced out.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.660]   And I never knew this kind of silicon drama existed.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:24.940]   Well it's big drama because Intel has decided to put off its 7 nanometer process.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.380]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:27.380]   Maybe two years.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.060]   It's a year already a year behind.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.700]   Might be as long as two years.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:36.780]   As a result, they have now fired their head of engineering.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.780]   Merti Rendu Chintala is gone.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:46.460]   And I presume he's taking the, he was the chief engineering officer taking the fall
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.940]   for the failure to do 7 nanometer.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.260]   At this point, Apple saying C.
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:55.780]   The gossip over the weekend, he came from Qualcomm and they hired a real bunch of really
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.300]   talented people who just suddenly started leaving.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.180]   And the gossip was that he wanted to be CEO and got passed over and was trying to position
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.420]   himself so there could be no other contenders.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.780]   I got way too into the.
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:09.740]   Who would want to be CEO of Intel at this point?
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:15.020]   I mean, the thing is, there was, I think Ben Thompson had also had some astute analysis
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.260]   on this too, but, and so did Ben Behren that they were making so much money that it hid
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:24.700]   problems because their server business was so valuable and it was on old nodes and they
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:29.740]   were reinvesting on old nodes and investors didn't take that as a warning sign because
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:34.620]   typically they invest on new nodes because those pay forward and the problems just mounted
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.420]   up like the success is bad.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:43.380]   It's not good to be successful because it hides potential problems in the organization
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:48.180]   Intel was too successful with what they were doing and as a result, they fell farther and
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:53.380]   farther behind and it really does confirm what Apple's strategy was frankly.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:58.420]   And the market didn't make them pay for it because they were still profitable and that
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.340]   and so like they're still going and they're hoping all the stuff is being hidden and the
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.380]   market's still giving them adulation.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.540]   But then when it stops, it's like hitting a brick wall.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:14.420]   Jamie nominations are in and Apple got its first Emmy nominations this morning.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.900]   The morning show, Central Park, you were just talking about how much you like that, defending
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.380]   Jacob, which I was impressed by.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:26.020]   The elephant queen and the Beastie Boys story all nominated.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:32.460]   Steve Carell nominated for Best Actor in the morning show, Jennifer Aniston, Best Actress,
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.460]   Billy Crudup also from the morning show.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.460]   He was so good.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.460]   He was the best.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.460]   He was actually the only reason to watch that.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:43.700]   I think I'm blanking on her name, but the woman that he was having was Dean Harrasque
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.700]   was unbelievably good.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.340]   Mark II Plus, another character.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:53.700]   He was the executive producer, Billy and Mark, supporting actor nominations, guest actor
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:54.700]   Martin Short.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.220]   What was he against in?
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:58.460]   Oh, he was great in the morning show.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.620]   He was the sleazy me to producer.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.620]   Great.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:09.620]   Yeah, Steve Carell went to and saying, "Well, it's not that bad, is it?"
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.460]   And he said, "Well, you guys were bad."
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:19.260]   Mimi Letter, Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary Program, Outstanding
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.420]   Main Title Design.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   I disagree with that.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.300]   I had to skip that main title.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:27.780]   And I wish Apple TV Plus had the skip button that Netflix and others have.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   I think they do.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.460]   Because that's stupid dot title.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   Do they?
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:32.460]   I think they do.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.380]   I'm not tempted, but I'm almost positive I see it.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   I don't know what that was.
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:37.380]   Can I skip that thing hard?
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.820]   What did that have to do with anything?
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:40.460]   It was just dots.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.460]   And it was so long.
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.460]   It went on and on and on.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:49.020]   Central Park, Leslie Odom Jr., Aaron Burr, Outstanding Character, Voice Over Performance.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.540]   Who does he play in Central Park?
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:51.900]   I see Josh Gad.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.940]   He's good in it, but who does Leslie Odom Jr. play?
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:55.940]   I don't know.
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:56.940]   Maybe I haven't.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   Oh, I forget because I went over them.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.940]   And they're not obvious.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   They're not like...
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:01.940]   It's am.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.660]   I predict on any given moment who's playing what kind of character I'm thinking.
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.780]   It's animated so you can't tell.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:13.180]   Defending Jacob, Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music, Outstanding Cinematography,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:19.700]   Home, Outstanding Music Composition, The Elephant Queen, Outstanding Narrator for Chuevita
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.500]   and Chuevita for He's Wonderful.
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.060]   I love him.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060]   Beastie Boy's...
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.900]   A lot of nominations for Outstanding History.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:26.900]   They had me at Beastie Boy's.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.900]   That was so good.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.900]   Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Nonfiction.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.700]   So a bunch of Emmy nominations.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.980]   In the daytime Emmys, they also got nominations.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.140]   I'm sorry, they won yesterday.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.020]   I guess the daytime's are earlier.
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.780]   For Ghostwriter and Peanuts in Space, the secrets of Apollo 10.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:52.980]   17 awards overall in the daytime Emmys, eight of which were Ghostwriter alone.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.540]   The TV version of the Emmy Awards are September 20th.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.540]   See that?
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.540]   How are they going to do that?
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:09.780]   But I mean, this is not just showbiz news because there are only a couple of things
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.820]   that you can give to talent to get them to come to your network.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.740]   One of them is Big, Big Boat Loads of Money.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   I'm sorry, three.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.020]   The second one is Freedom.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.620]   The third one is Priscy.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.620]   Awards.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.620]   And those awards, they don't...
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:26.700]   And awards don't happen just because, well, our policy at the network is we just put on
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.500]   the best show and we're convinced that if the shows are good, we're going to get the
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.500]   good enough.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.420]   The Academy will notice them and reward them.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:38.420]   No, you have to have a team that knows how to promote and market a series and a talent
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   for those awards.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.940]   And that's how they're going to be competitive and that's how they're going to the next time
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:50.820]   that there's a major director who decides to sell his next movie to a streaming service
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.860]   and it becomes Apple TV Plus.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:57.980]   It's going to be because they are able to provide that kind of total package.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:03.180]   Like this with a grain of salt, but Bloomberg had a story.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.860]   Apple's new services off to a slow start in first year.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.940]   And the problem is Apple doesn't break out.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.300]   Services looks good more than $16 billion last quarter and we'll find out Thursday, but
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.780]   I bet it'll be 17, 18.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:19.980]   It's been a steady growth and they don't break it out.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:26.980]   But an analyst did at least attempted to and I don't know how accurate this is Tony
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:35.580]   Secondagi from Sanford C. Bernstein broke down what she thinks contributed to Apple
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.580]   services revenue.
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:44.180]   App Store by far the biggest for 2020 for the year.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.420]   Number two was the licensing deal with Google, which is where we'd be worth more than $11
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.420]   billion.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:54.100]   Then Apple care and $8 billion property.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:58.580]   But just think about that when you buy Apple care, you're helping Apple out.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.060]   So thank you very much.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.060]   Not me, I'm bricked so so often.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.420]   Yeah, you think you can.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:06.700]   Yes, see, I don't buy insurance because I figure there may.
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:10.900]   It's a profit center, which it clearly is, which means in the long run, it's going to
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.180]   cost you more to use Apple care than not, right?
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.620]   In the long run, but that might be the very, very long run.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   I am so clumsy.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.620]   You're a Clutz.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:18.620]   Okay.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:19.860]   Yeah, if you're Clutz by Apple care.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.340]   Another, I don't know what other is, iCloud Apple Music way down toward the bottom.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.340]   There's the Apple Arcade and all the other services.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:28.340]   Oh, yeah, that's other.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.340]   Okay.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.860]   Apple TV plus way down close to the bottom.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:36.180]   The only thing worse iTunes downloads, which she estimated to be about 1.1.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.180]   Well, they gave Apple TV.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.260]   So like I love Mark and he does a lot of really good articles.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:43.180]   This one felt like a roundup of things that like we were joking that we couldn't find
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:47.140]   the news in this because it is just what it is.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.740]   And they gave away like a year of Apple TV plus.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.940]   That's not going to be off the center.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.460]   The whole thing was weird to me.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.580]   Yeah, I haven't had to buy Apple.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.820]   But see, here's the question.
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:59.700]   I guess for five bucks it's worth it.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:06.300]   But the problem Apple TV plus faces is it has no catalog and there's no new stuff being
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.460]   made.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:12.580]   So it's really a challenge to justify that five bucks if you've seen it all.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.940]   And it will be next year when there is no new stuff.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.280]   Like their plan I think initially was to have a new blockbuster movie every month and a new
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.260]   series debuting every week.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.300]   And that would carry them over the lack of catalog.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.740]   It would be like appointment TV and now nothing's being produced.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.980]   And I know that's a problem for Netflix in every company.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:32.940]   But those companies have catalog content that you can go back and watch.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:33.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:37.860]   I mean, I thought acquiring Greyhound was a smart move for $70 million.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.420]   I watched it.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   It was a great movie.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.100]   But I don't know if I'd pay the subscription fee for that.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:50.540]   That might be something that they try to do for now since they can't make new TV shows
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:54.660]   right now is just continually just try to buy these films.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.260]   But there aren't any new first run movies.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.860]   I mean, it's really challenging right now.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:04.980]   Well, it's also an interesting year because not only these companies that have not been
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:09.180]   able to put these movies and theaters are facing not only that loss of revenue, but now they
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.220]   can't even get them in front of.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.900]   They can't even get in front of like Academy.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.140]   They're not offering the $20 rentals as much anymore.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:20.580]   I have a feeling that was a work for trolls world tour.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.340]   That's a very beginning.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.340]   That was straight down.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:24.860]   Not going to work for tenant, right?
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   And so tenants are really good example.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.300]   There's a lot of buzz for this.
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.060]   This is the new Christopher Nolan movie.
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:36.580]   It's a sci-fi sort of it's not time travel.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.700]   But it's a couple of problems.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:44.060]   First of all, they can't release it really in the US because no theaters are open.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:48.900]   So they're going to release it in Europe, but that's a huge risk because of piracy.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.340]   But also Nolan wants the plot to be a secret.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.140]   So this is going to be a big huge spoiler.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.340]   And then if he releases it, when would he release it in the US?
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.300]   I don't know when the movie theaters reopen.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:05.980]   And same with like Black Widow and they're juggling dates all over the place right now.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:10.540]   I was listening to John August podcast this morning and him and Craig Mason were thinking
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:14.940]   there's got me any there won't be any big scale movie releases until December of next
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.780]   year, which is yikes.
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:21.900]   So it just is my impression that Hollywood decided the $20 rental didn't make sense.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.900]   Is that confirmed?
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.980]   I mean, I don't see any new ones.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.300]   I don't think so.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.420]   I think it's basically that they realize that they're not going to make their money
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.980]   back on Wonder Woman 84.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.780]   They're not going to make their money back on Black Widow.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:39.180]   And as for the Tom Hanks movie, that is the sort of that is at least the sort of movie
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:44.100]   where people are going who are going to be sitting out sitting at home, nestling around
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.380]   the glowing light of the television set that would be attracted to them.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:54.100]   And when even there wasn't a $20 paper view, it was a Apple having their checkbook open
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.340]   and wanting a prestige.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.860]   Yeah, the movie was done.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.660]   They basically bought it.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.660]   I mean, I showed them.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:04.940]   When they bought the Will Smith movie for even more money, that isn't even made.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:08.740]   That movie won't be out until 2021 at the very earliest.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.780]   So this is challenging for Apple.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.420]   What, you know, how do you add new content?
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.340]   Couldn't happen in the worst time for Apple TV.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:21.140]   Plus, plus we have one theater chain that says they want to open Labor Day weekend.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:26.140]   But there's even there's even even if there are people who are silly enough to want to
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:31.060]   go to a movie theater in late August, I'm sure I've seen enough video that I know that
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.500]   there are people selling to do that.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.540]   There's a question about whether or not the government governors in those states are going
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:41.180]   to say, okay, our state just got colored from from yellow to orange to red.
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:43.140]   We are going to do mandatory lockdowns again.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.660]   And now all non essential businesses are closed.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.900]   It's a hell of a situation to try to make a buck in.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:51.820]   Or they'll just change the color like some of the states have been doing and like wasn't
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:55.580]   the Marlins have now tested positive for COVID like get there.
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:59.700]   This stuff is so tenuous that to be really aggressive.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:04.460]   I understand everyone is frustrated and wants to go back to life as normal, but it's it's
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.460]   it's not worth it.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.940]   It's objectively, evidently not working.
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.260]   Yeah, it's definitely problematic.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:13.420]   And, you know, it hits the economy in interesting ways.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.460]   It hasn't heard Apple's stock, although Thursday is going to be very interesting because for
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:25.940]   instance, if services don't go up for this quarter, that I would think would hurt Apple's
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.940]   stock.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.940]   Don't you think this year?
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.700]   Yeah, I think this year is like it's going to be all asterisked out of the history books.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.500]   Like this was 2020.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:37.500]   We're not going to it was it was such an outlier when we just hope 2021 is better, but it's
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.900]   not going to be used for any statistical modeling going forward.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.460]   I mean, I'll bet it was, you know, but but it will point out of failure.
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:48.620]   If you're a streaming service and your audience did not go zooming up, you got a problem with
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:49.620]   your model.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.860]   We get because what was it was the organ is the the analyst group that did the state
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:33:00.460]   of the streaming you stay the streaming union report just last week and which they're showing
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.660]   Twitch is way up Facebook videos way up up at least 50% across the board.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:09.260]   So when you launch when you launch a streaming service in this market and you can't get people
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.820]   to get pay attention to you.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:16.060]   Or if you say that, hey, here's here is what our plan was for Apple TV.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.820]   Here are the number of users and hours of video that we thought we'd be streaming by
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.700]   this time after a year.
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:27.320]   And that that curve remained pretty flat while everybody was stuck at home, including kids.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:32.060]   That's going to be or if that number is not up as much as people would think that it was
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.940]   going to be that that's at the minimum going to point out that you've got some work to
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:36.940]   do.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:43.100]   So concerning when Apple TV's big announcement this week is that they bought a Warner Herzog
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.060]   documentary about meteorites.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.900]   I know Andy, you love Werner Herzog.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.500]   I mean, I love it.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.980]   I thought it was John Gruber's documentary.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:52.980]   I was so confused.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.140]   Not daring fireball.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:55.940]   Just is Herzog playing Gruber?
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.580]   I'm so confused.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.580]   It's about meteorites.
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.660]   I mean, Mandalorian did really well for Disney plus and Herzog.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:13.180]   But still, it just, I think this, the fact that shows you the lack of content available
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.420]   out there.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:21.020]   I would argue I'm not particularly interested in most of the documentaries on TV plus.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:25.780]   I will watch a Warner Herzog documentary hands down anytime.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.460]   So there's some fans out there who will jump on that.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.780]   It actually sounds pretty cool.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:39.020]   He's partnered with a previous collaborator, a professor, Clive Oppenheimer, and Fireball,
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:43.260]   which is the name of it, promises to help viewers discover how shooting stars, meteorites,
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.300]   and deep impacts have focused the human imagination on other realms and worlds and on our past
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.300]   and future.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   So yeah, maybe that's-
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.180]   Well, we know there's aliens now, Leo.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.500]   So this is all just coming together.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.900]   It's all about the aliens, folks.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:05.220]   I just want them to use that new metal to make the next MacBooks so that they're even better.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:11.140]   I just wonder if Apple's going to allow access to the NFC chip for the chips that the COVID
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:13.260]   vaccine is going to be implanting in our skin.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.580]   And I know that there, it's being created by Bill Gates, but I hope they'll put their
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.780]   old animosces aside to make sure there's an platform.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.780]   There was this great news joking folks.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.780]   He's joking.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.860]   There was this great meme of like Bill wants to be pulled from Twitter.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:30.100]   But oh, there was this great meme of Bill Gates wanting to cure COVID and it was saying
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.700]   he just wants to chip you and then Elon Musk saying, "Yeah, we're going to put a chip
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.700]   in everybody's head.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   It's going to be great.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   It'll cure everything."
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:36.700]   And everyone's going, "Go, Elon!"
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.300]   You know, it's just not the story.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:44.460]   Why does Apple charge $130 for their Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable?
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.180]   Because Thunderbolt's expensive.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:54.660]   It's like 70 bucks to say it's a six foot cable and if it doesn't work properly, you're
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:55.660]   kind of screwed.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.940]   So, good point.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.940]   That's a long, long throw.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:58.940]   Is it optically?
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.940]   I forgot to check.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.940]   I don't know.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.660]   I don't know either.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.660]   It's okay.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:08.220]   USB 4 is going to, there was this thing about like, you know, everyone keeps wanting everything
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.540]   to switch to USB C and I forget where it was.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.540]   Michael's how I'll link to it.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:15.060]   But Sky's like, "I've got all these USB C devices and none of the cables work with any
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:19.860]   of the special fast chargers and I can't find the right fast charger and this one has
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.980]   power delivery and this one doesn't and this one does the fast charging."
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:27.220]   And I just make it all go away and I was thinking, "Yeah, USB 4 will save all of us."
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:28.220]   But no.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.940]   These cables are tyrannical.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:34.460]   No, Steve Wozniak is not going to double your Bitcoin.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:42.640]   In fact, he's suing because YouTube has taken so long to pull these scam videos featuring
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:47.380]   him and others from the YouTube.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.940]   And Wozniak says, "They just ignore me.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940]   It's been going on for years."
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.740]   But we put up two minutes of Apple footage and they take it down right away.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.740]   It's ridiculous.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:36:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:02.980]   And also, and the complaint also points out that, "Look, Twitter had a problem and they
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:03.980]   got, they were right on it."
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.900]   Of course, it helped that, that actually almost took down Twitter.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:14.260]   But still, as soon as I saw a Bitcoin scam going on, the fact they were able to lock
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.820]   it down completely, yes, it wasn't just simply people posting a tweet pretending to be somebody
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.420]   else, it was actually hijacking the accounts.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.660]   But yeah, if someone like Steve Wozniak can't get the attention of the person to say that
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.660]   hi.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:30.340]   So, I was saying that I'm giving away free money and it really is harshing my mellow.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.420]   Could you please knock this thing down?
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.460]   And even this guy cannot get the attention and action made.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:45.220]   What can a creator who's saying, "Hi, a piece of audio from the YouTube library of
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:50.020]   static has gotten my entire channel copyright claimed by a Chinese company.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:54.620]   Could you please give me all my content back and you hear nothing back for four months?"
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:38:00.140]   That shows that there is a serious problem in the production, in the work chain of how
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:02.420]   YouTube handles the handles complaints.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.780]   I hope this dude goes forward.
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:07.740]   Well, he might not have much hope.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:12.700]   Woz's wife, Janet, says she's contacted YouTube numerous times since May about the scam.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:16.020]   The scam is YouTube is protected by Section 230.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:20.540]   So according to ours, technical legal experts think this is...
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:21.540]   It's a bad look though.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.340]   Like I think the publicity will be far more effective.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.380]   I think that's the main thing and I sure was.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   Yeah, the lawsuit.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.380]   Got that advice.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:31.580]   Because it wasn't a headline until this happened.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.580]   Right.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:37.500]   They'll win in the court of public opinion, if not in actual courts.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.940]   And if nothing else, at least he's pointed out that that's a scam.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.940]   That's not me.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940]   I'll say that.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:43.940]   Mm-hmm.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:51.980]   Did you know, according to iMore, there's an entire subreddit where people share photos
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.020]   of their Apple boxes.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:57.900]   Reddit, is there anything it can't do?
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.900]   I know.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.380]   I have in my closet, I probably have at least 10 Apple boxes.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:05.460]   It's a shame to throw them away.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.460]   It really does.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.140]   There's a touch point and use them to organize drawers.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.140]   Oh.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:13.740]   Georgia does amazing things with Apple boxes.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.740]   What a great idea.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.580]   She uses them as little organizers.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.580]   It's brilliant.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:19.580]   She's so smart.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.140]   Does she cover them with contact paper to make them look pretty?
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.340]   They look pretty without it.
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.780]   They're pretty sturdy dividers.
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   And they are pretty sturdy.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:30.580]   You know, actually, I've bought those dividers.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.700]   Now, I mean, throw away my Apple boxes.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.420]   I should really keep them.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.340]   Can I make one suggestion, though?
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:42.700]   I think that the next, they're beautiful boxes and you keep them and maybe you cover them
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:43.700]   with papers.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:48.220]   They don't look quite so reused, but because they're two good boxes, not to hold on to.
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:54.380]   But how many times has each of us witnessed somebody who's just bought their, oh, wow,
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:57.100]   I've just bought my new $1,000 iPhone.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.860]   And then they take off the shrink wrap and they expect a loose fitting box like anything
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.860]   else.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:05.500]   And when the top doesn't come off like I said, they start shaking it and then suddenly
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:08.260]   everything goes flying, including their $1,000 phone.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.140]   And they need to have just a little bit of a hole, like airflow, so that they will break
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.260]   that suction seal because the fit is so tight and so beautiful.
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.060]   Because the last time I saw that happen was actually like a month before lockdown.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.460]   It was that someone must have bought a new iPhone at the Apple store that was near the
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.860]   train station and couldn't wait to set it up.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.620]   And so we'll ring for the train.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.380]   And it just went cooked, clunk.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:36.740]   And it was that frozen in space saying, I just, I didn't just do what I think I just
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.740]   did.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:43.100]   Well, the longer I delay before picking this up off the floor, the longer I delay fighting
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.580]   out the screen is broken before I even got to Kirk doll.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   So depressing.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.060]   Yeah, it should be like,
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.860]   Do you know the end result of that whether or not the screen broke?
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.980]   I feel like we need results.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:56.500]   I think it was okay, but the thing is it wasn't it was a hard floor.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:02.860]   So now you got to think that scratches the first, well, not just that, but like the first
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:08.660]   time he says, and this is waterproof to like three feet and like, no, well, it was water
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:14.580]   resistant and that was also also reliant on not on like screws and gaskets, but on adhesives
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:18.740]   and seals that kind of might have like sheared a little bit.
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:23.980]   Every time every time you drop a phone and you think it was okay, chances are it just
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:28.060]   did just a little bit of damage so that you're now that the countdown is you got two more
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:33.500]   drops before something cracks because you started to like this tiny little stress, stress fracture
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.740]   that you can't see.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:40.420]   So that's just the look on everybody's face when because it's such a natural thing to
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:44.580]   happen or put or put that or if you want to make it even classier, put that like red
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.020]   ribbon that you sometimes see where you lift up the ribbon, it will actually separate the
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.020]   bottom from the top.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.380]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:55.420]   They know of people having a subreddit about saving their ribbons.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:00.300]   I always feel guilty when I'm breaking down those boxes for the recycling.
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.140]   They just slash R slash and not told.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.140]   Let's do it.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:05.100]   So depressing.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.140]   So I thought this was a lot.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.740]   I think a lot of things are odd.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.460]   I think it's odd that Major League Baseball is attempting a season.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:17.540]   I thought it was really weird when CES said, oh, yeah, we're going to have CES and jam.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.540]   Never mind.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:25.260]   CES has decided to go all online only in 2021.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:28.580]   That's the hard sound of reality falling on them that you hear.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.380]   They had all sorts of plans for protecting attendees and they're limited to tenants and
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.180]   all sorts of things.
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.540]   COVID laughs at their plans.
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.700]   It's like we've seen this over and over again.
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   I forget what it was, but someone had a gathering over the weekend.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:43.660]   It was like 40 people and now they want to have the same gathering.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:45.940]   Like it's 40 people got infected and they want the same gathering.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:48.140]   It's the definition of insanity.
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:55.620]   Gary Shapiro talking to VentureB teased, of course, the CEO of CTA, the consumer technology
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.420]   association that puts this show on every year.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:04.300]   He said, "As month by month went by, it was our hope somehow this would resolve by January.
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.860]   But the assumption is there will not be a vaccine that will be widely available and considered
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.220]   safe by January out of board meeting."
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.020]   The issue was, "What is the right thing to do?
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.660]   We're making the decision based on the right thing to do."
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:20.740]   Not the best financial thing, I'm sure it's going to really hit them hard.
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.740]   They already have, I'm sure, purchased the hotel rooms.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.740]   Yeah, Unbless Vegas hard.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.060]   It's less Vegas hard too.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.460]   It's 180,000 people who won't be going.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.260]   It's harder to translate these things.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:39.380]   This last week was supposed to be San Diego Comic-Con, like the biggest Comic-Con and the oldest
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   one.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:44.540]   Of course, the council did it a couple of months ago, but they decided to do what we'll do
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:49.500]   a virtual Comic-Con where we have a virtual hall-age, still the big panels and the big
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.020]   sessions.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.420]   But now it'll be just streamed live.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:56.020]   The numbers were astonishing.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:44:03.260]   There were 14,000 people maybe watching, which at an event that is supposed to be anybody
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:10.220]   who's vaguely interested in comics or pop culture events would be interested in.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.100]   That's not where Renee gets.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:18.740]   He doesn't have a $200 million movie opening next year.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:19.740]   Yeah.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.580]   It's Montreal finally made a mask law and they started enforcing it.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.100]   Then the Quebec government said, "It's okay.
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.820]   We'll have gatherings of up to 250 people indoors now.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.460]   It's no problem."
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:31.660]   The whole thing is just baffling to me.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.660]   Go for it, man.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:36.580]   Watch for the surge.
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:40.060]   Google has announced that it's going to let employees continue to stay home until the
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.220]   summer of next year.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.220]   Good on Google.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.220]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:47.500]   Twitter said you never have to come back.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.660]   Apple seems to be bringing employees back.
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:53.820]   I wonder if they'll rethink that.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.580]   The people, my understanding is it's the people that have to do, like, specific.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:02.340]   If you're using the CNC machines and the design lab, it's very hard to move to home,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.420]   but they're doing everything they can to check people and keeping very minimal people
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:10.220]   and not bringing back people who don't have to be there.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:13.020]   How was Pokemon GoFest, the virtual Pokemon?
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.020]   It was super interesting.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:17.420]   I had to, again, they refused to fix the stupid bug.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:22.380]   Usually, I say you can't complain about software on beta devices, but this is so stupid and
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.620]   they could fix it so easily.
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.300]   I had to use an old device to do it, but it was pretty well done.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:32.300]   Basically, there was just a ton of stuff and there were tasks that you could do along the
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.300]   way.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:37.140]   I played with my God kids for a few hours on Saturday and we all had a lot of fun.
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:40.060]   I honestly think that they should have done this ages ago.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.980]   It's kind of cool to play with people.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:44.540]   I'd like to play with you today, but I'm not going to be in Montreal.
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.020]   You can do remote raids now, so if you're at a raid, you can invite me and I can jump on
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.020]   with you.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:51.100]   It's so much better than what they were doing before.
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.780]   This is a change they should make.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.460]   It still doesn't work on iOS 14, though.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:00.900]   No, the same reason you're banking apps don't work on iOS 14.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.820]   I don't want to get too far into it, but it's so dumb.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:06.980]   My banking app works, but it says it looks like you're on a jailbroken iPhone.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.460]   Are you sure you want to keep doing this?
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:10.540]   It's a really bad SDK that they shouldn't.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.140]   Again, I'm going to get in a hole.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:17.020]   We've seen apps won't even launch when the Facebook SDK has a bad line feed in it.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   So, please stop me.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.020]   Let's go.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.820]   Start to then closes immediately.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:22.460]   Is that the same thing?
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.460]   What is going on?
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.460]   I believe so.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:27.620]   I don't know how much I can say about it or not, but my understanding is that they're
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.980]   using the same sort of dodgy stuff that those banking apps are using and they really shouldn't
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:31.980]   be.
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:39.740]   So, by using deprecated or unofficial SDKs or APIs, yeah, well, that's always a dumb
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740]   idea.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.740]   Yes.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.900]   And they could literally fix it.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.940]   So, well, I mean, all those banking apps could fix it.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:47.140]   So, it makes me salty.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.420]   Yeah, it makes me salty, too.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.300]   Hey, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:53.900]   Your picks of the week, prepare them, if you will.
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:55.540]   As you know, our show is brought to you.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.700]   It always has been by cash fly.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:04.420]   That's our content delivery network that's been an innovating content delivery since 1999.
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:06.220]   I just got an email this week.
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:10.460]   I get one pretty regularly from other CDN saying, "Hey, hey, hey.
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460]   You ever have trouble?
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.900]   We could help you."
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.300]   And all I can say is, you know what?
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.340]   Cash fly has been 100% perfect for 10 years.
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:22.100]   I'm not going anywhere, buddy.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:26.980]   Cash fly is the fastest global throughput CDN.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.660]   They're a lot faster than any other way of delivering because it's a CDN, but it's faster
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.060]   even than their competition.
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:36.780]   And now it's more affordable.
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:40.820]   One of the things I've always liked about cash flies, it saves us from having to worry
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:41.820]   about spikes.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.700]   So, you know, our downloads of the podcast are very spiky.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:49.300]   You know, we'll get a lot of hits tonight for Mac break weekly, then it'll slowly trail
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:50.300]   off.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:52.500]   It's very spiky in the next Tuesday up and again.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:57.180]   And the last thing I'd want to do with the CDN is be constantly checking to make sure
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.300]   I didn't go over the cap or whatever.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.780]   Cash fly spreads your usage out over a year, saying they bill you monthly, the same thing
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:06.540]   every month, so you know exactly what you're going to pay.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.620]   You don't have to worry about going through some arbitrary limit.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.900]   I just love that.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:20.020]   And now they're even saving me money on transfer from my origins to the content delivery network.
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:23.460]   They call it 100% cash shield.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:29.020]   It's a new feature that's going to save you drastic reduction in data transfer fees from
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:35.860]   places like AWS's S3, which is where we store our stuff, other cloud storage origins by
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:38.340]   increasing your cash hit ratio to 100%.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.740]   Understand why this works.
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:42.100]   You need to understand how a CDN works.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:48.100]   You know, they're caching my podcasts or your apps or your stream or whatever at the end
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.380]   point near your customers because they have servers all over the world.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:49:00.380]   But if you get a cash miss, if somebody goes to a site and it doesn't have that data, it
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:03.140]   will have to go to your origin and download it.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:07.660]   And if your cash items are being evicted for large one off requests, it can cost you a
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.900]   fortune in data transfer out fees.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:18.060]   I love 100% cash field because it is dedicated storage on cash fly just for you.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.300]   It keeps your data and content closer to your customers.
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.700]   You don't have to worry about traffic over other companies networks.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.940]   You could purchase as much space as you want.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:30.740]   Your data will be fetched from 100% cash shield rather than your origin.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.620]   So shielding reduces origin spend.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:38.100]   Many cases by thousands of months, but it also guarantees no cash misses.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.020]   And a cash miss means buffering or a pause or a halt.
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:43.900]   It slows down download speeds.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:44.900]   It's terrible.
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.420]   Look at all the companies that use cash fly.
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.700]   They're just the best.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:55.020]   If you're streaming video, you can reach global audiences of any size with an area hiccup,
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:50:00.220]   no buffering, hyper fast download speeds, low latency, a scalable solution for gaming.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:07.100]   And of course, we love it because you may not know it, but you get our podcasts fast
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.020]   without ever a problem.
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:10.380]   And that is important to me.
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:12.380]   I don't want any 3am calls.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:17.340]   I want to make sure that when this show is done, it gets to you as fast as possible.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:23.260]   Cash fly is global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses if you use
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:29.100]   100% cash shield are delivered 5 times faster than from your origins.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.100]   We're big fans.
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:31.100]   You will be too.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:36.220]   Right now, if you want to know how much cash fly can save, bring your bill, your CDN
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.700]   bill and your usage trends to cash fly.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:41.460]   And they'll tell you, no hard sell, no pressure.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.460]   It's just for you.

[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.300]   It is the most amazing thing.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:02.700]   See if you're overpaying 20% or more for your CDN twit.cashfly.com.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:06.860]   Thank you, cash fly twit.cashfly.com to learn more.
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:10.660]   Somebody in the chat or mask me, I'm going to start the picks of the week with my iPhone
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:11.660]   case.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.140]   I forgot I've been showing this for the last few weeks.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:19.420]   I've been using it, but I never mentioned what it was.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:26.500]   It is a Bellafino leather iPhone case, a wallet from Pat and Quill.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.740]   They make beautiful leather stuff.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:35.460]   This is a I like keeping my driver's license and my cash and my one or two credit cards
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.980]   with my phone so that I don't have to carry a wallet when I'm out and about.
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:41.380]   I just carry my phone with me and I'm going to have it here.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:42.620]   Comes in a variety of colors.
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:47.900]   I got the brown with kind of a dark green on the inside.
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:55.340]   The other thing I really like about this is they offer for a small additional fee straps,
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:57.660]   colorful straps.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:01.780]   I'm using the orange right now, but I can also do is baby blue, yellow and black.
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:03.620]   I bought the straps to go with it.
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:05.140]   I think it was an extra 10 bucks.
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:06.740]   They're very easy to change.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:08.740]   It's kind of like your watch band, Renee.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:12.260]   It gives you a little change of pace anytime you want.
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:14.860]   This is a really nice iPhone case.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:19.700]   The case that the phone is in detaches, so you can, if you want it for wireless charging
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:23.260]   or just want to carry your phone without your wallet, I never detach it.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.660]   It's got, if I'm not going to do it now, it's got a 3M kind of sticky thing on the back.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:29.940]   That is the only knock on this.
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:34.500]   If you don't detach the case, you can't wirelessly charge, but I think the convenience for me
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.500]   of having a wallet.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:40.020]   I like wallet cases and this is the leather is so nice and wears so well.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.020]   A little pricey.
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:43.340]   It's about 90 bucks, but that's my pick of the week.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:49.140]   The pad and quill, Bellafino leather iPhone case.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.500]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.020]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:54.940]   Inner Alex Lindsay here.
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:55.940]   Sorry.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:59.420]   I'm channeling my, so again, I'm channeling my inner Alex Lindsay.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.020]   Oh, I was wondering him.
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:02.940]   Oh, I almost picked this.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:05.020]   You're crazy, man.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:10.740]   It has been an absolutely, like as terrible as 2020 has been.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:14.500]   It is my least favorite DC Universe movie by far.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.540]   As terrible as it's been, summer has been amazing for cameras.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:20.660]   We saw the R5 and R6 from Canon.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:25.220]   We saw a 12K camera from Blackmagic, which is just ludicrous.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:27.580]   And now we have Sony's new entry.
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:30.500]   The, I'm going to get this wrong, A7 S3.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.500]   That's right.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.460]   Their naming conventions aren't easy, but yeah, A7 S3.
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:38.580]   But it is a lot of things that people, like the Canon, the Canon cameras were great, but
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:44.380]   they had overheating and hard stop issues when you're doing 8K, 4K, 120, you know, even
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.460]   4K, 60, 4K, 30.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:48.580]   This so far, nobody's found those hard limits.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:55.020]   I think if you, if you start doing a lot of 4K, 120 in H.In H.E.V.C. it'll, it'll, it'll
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:54:00.340]   tap out after an hour, but it's got everything, every Sony camera enthusiast has been asking
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:08.380]   for a properly articulated flip sideways screen, like nature and, and you know, humans prefer.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:09.980]   It's got good codecs.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:10.980]   You can do 10 bit.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:11.980]   You can do raw.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:17.020]   It is capped at 4K and some people are complaining there's no 6K down sampled or 8K, but really
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.020]   so what.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:21.540]   And it's 12 megapixels, which some people are also complaining about, but the results
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:23.300]   like this is not a pixel quality.
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.620]   This is not for a still quality.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.260]   Yeah, this is not for a still shooter.
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:28.540]   This is for somebody who wants to do video in low light.
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:29.540]   I'm an A7 user.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.540]   Yes.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:36.700]   And if you want megapixels, you go with the A7R, but if, but if you want a great video,
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.220]   and by the way, this shoots Apple ProRes.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:40.380]   Yes.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:42.500]   And even like the, even the 12 megapixels are really good.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:45.740]   I saw a lot of side by side was, was 48 megapixel sensors.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:49.940]   And this looked better in some of those circumstances because the quality of those pixels are so
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:50.940]   good.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.780]   4 times bigger than the megapixels in a higher, you know, the high res full, it's full frame
[01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:56.780]   sensor.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.780]   12 megapixels.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:58.780]   That means big pixels.
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:54:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:02.780]   And it is, it just checks all the boxes.
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.300]   I saw some of the early videos go up.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:09.060]   Gerald Undone, which is a really good YouTube channel, gives it like an incredibly in-depth
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:14.660]   nerdy geeky review, even brings out the dynamic range machines to measure how many stock,
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.380]   and there's a ludicrous amount of dynamic range.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:19.300]   And he figured out it's got dual ISO.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.540]   So it's like, it's really good.
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:21.540]   I think it's like 670.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.900]   Then it gets noisy until you hit 1600.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.420]   Then it's clean again.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:28.740]   And it goes up like, and it's just, it, it looks like an astounding.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:35.660]   It's not a Cinec camera, but it's only like $5,000 if you get like a bunch of the accoutrements,
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.740]   like the, they have an XLR mounted a bunch of other things.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:42.980]   And it, if you don't need the very quirky specific things about a Cinec camera, this
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:48.220]   is like as high end prosumer, you, you could probably talk to documentary series off the
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.740]   back of this camera and well.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:57.060]   I have to say it's an interesting, you know, if you want a K, you're going to get the R5,
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.060]   the Canon.
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:00.940]   If you want more megapixels, you're going to get the Canon.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:03.580]   You have to have more megapixels for 8K.
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:07.540]   But low light is pretty important.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:11.580]   And the A7 has always been, A7S has always been in a low light.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.580]   And sustained shooting.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:15.820]   Like if you are shooting long form things, like you're doing a documentary, you're doing
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:19.020]   something you can't guarantee you'll be under 20 minutes, you know.
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:20.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:22.140]   They have special cooling, so they don't have the same problem.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.140]   They are five.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:26.100]   And all our nerd friends were ordering like two or three of them immediately this morning
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.420]   because that's what they do.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:30.060]   It's only what almost 4,000 for the body.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:35.020]   But I mean, it is expensive when you look at like a consumer camera, but it is so inexpensive
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:39.740]   for what it does that if you're in like if you're again, like you said, it's more video
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:40.740]   than it is still shooting.
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:45.540]   But if you're in this racket, it is an unbelievable, it looks to be an unbelievable value.
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.060]   I love my A7S.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.060]   I really do.
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:50.060]   It's a great video camera.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.060]   And this is more to love.
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.660]   It's just literally more to love.
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:55.500]   And they fix the menu system, Leo, like people have been begging for that.
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.460]   So I love the articulated viewfinder.
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:01.620]   I really would like to, you know, that's one big improvement, I have to say.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:07.700]   And yeah, you know, 12 megapixels, we make fun of, you know, you know, this megapixel
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:11.060]   race, but 12 megapixels is still pretty darn good.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.060]   It's 4K.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:15.260]   And 10 bit, it does, it does 18 bit raw out through the HD.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:17.540]   It's got a full size HDMI 18 bit raw out.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:22.100]   It does get down to 12 meg, 12 bit when you record it, like you need to record on an external
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.100]   mod, like a ninja or something, but that's still phenomenal.
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:29.300]   And it's got a S log, I think that's like three and S log two.
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:33.260]   It's just, it ticks all the boxes.
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:34.260]   Very nice pick.
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.220]   Wish I could afford it.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:37.220]   I know, I know.
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:38.220]   I have cannons.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:41.340]   Like I literally can't afford to get all my lenses and stuff again.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.100]   I can recognize talent.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:44.100]   I don't know.
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:47.820]   I have to really decide if I were going to shoot more video between the R5 and this.
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:49.380]   I just, I just don't know.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.380]   This is really important.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.380]   It's like 12K Black Magic Leo.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.620]   Yeah, that's the other choice.
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:55.780]   We were talking about that the other day.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.060]   This is nice and compact though.
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.260]   I think they've really done a nice job.
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.660]   And people are arguing and they shouldn't be brand loyal.
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:03.420]   Like don't care who makes a camera.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.620]   Get the best camera for you.
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:06.220]   They're all good.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:11.340]   The problem is when you invest in glass, you kind of have to stick with whatever you
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.340]   invest in.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.540]   Fortunately, I have glass for a variety of systems.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.540]   Are you sad, Annie?
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.540]   The Olympus is announced.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.460]   They're killing the OMD line, which is very.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:25.660]   No, no, no, that wasn't the only one.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:26.660]   They sold it.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.660]   But Olympus had two major businesses.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:31.460]   One was like medical optics.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:34.180]   The other was the camera business.
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:40.020]   The camera business had a couple of bad years and they decided to sell it to the same company
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:44.140]   that bought Sony's VIO notebook business.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:47.540]   And all the information that I have at hand is not that they're going to sell it off
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:50.820]   for parts or they're going to stop making everything is still going to go on.
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:53.580]   Everybody who's still an engineer at Olympus is still going to be an engineer building these
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:54.580]   cameras.
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:55.580]   Oh, good.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:59:01.300]   But it's just going to be fortunately again, the Japanese company that bought it is not
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.580]   known for again, well, here's some real estate.
[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:04.580]   The VIO is not.
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:08.460]   They did not do well by the VIO brand, shall we say.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:15.340]   But the thing is that the thing to know is that it's not like they were, it's not like
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:20.700]   when Apple buys a hardware company and then suddenly they're not taking the hard work
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.660]   or when Polaroid, which used to be like when the major tech engineering brands of the
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:29.060]   70s and now the company who bought it basically wanted the logo.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:35.980]   They could stick on any kind of piece of like crap that they get from any OEM.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:40.100]   All I will say about it is that I was pretty, pretty excited about the third generation
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:45.540]   and no MD, M1, and I had decided like earlier this year that I'm going to put some money
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:51.140]   away and buy one early next year and I don't see any reason to change that decision right
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.140]   now.
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:53.140]   All right.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:56.740]   So, and the nice thing about micro four thirds glass is, you know, there's a lot of choices
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.740]   out there, a lot of choices.
[01:59:58.740 --> 01:59:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:02.740]   And the other thing, I mean, since we're talking about cameras, both the Sony and other things,
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:07.220]   this isn't like, this isn't like when Palm decided to stop making phones or when Windows
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:10.820]   decided to make Windows phones, where, okay, well, we're going to get software from now
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:14.620]   on and where you're going to get accessories and what is going to work on whatever network.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.020]   The thing is like, even if I love my OMD, M1, absolutely love it.
[02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:20.820]   It's a perfect camera for me.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:25.820]   So much so that even though this will be like a $1,600 expense that I could be putting
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:30.340]   into like buying a full frame camera, I don't want a full frame camera.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:34.940]   So the thing is, if I buy this model, this third generation hardware and it lasts me
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.620]   five, six, seven years, I'm perfectly happy.
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:42.340]   And this end, the body that I bought five years ago, and I've beaten the hell out of
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:43.340]   it.
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:46.780]   It's like an old, it's like a beloved science fiction book, where you know how much someone
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:51.300]   loves it by the fact that the spine is all broken and there's those coffee stains everywhere.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.500]   You can see all the places where it's the bottom of my hip.
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:55.500]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.500]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:57.500]   I've used in the rain.
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.540]   I've dropped on the sidewalk a couple of times and it works perfectly fine still.
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:06.060]   So that's just to underscore what Renee said, like there, you can drive yourself nuts looking
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:08.140]   at well, I took a week.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:13.180]   We took like 18 different spectograms based on the surface of the, it's like, okay, the
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.900]   fact of the matter is put this thing in your hand, which one feels like an extension of
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:21.420]   your creativity and which one is just a barrier, a piece of gadgetry that you have to figure
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:22.420]   out.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:27.300]   And for me, the, oh, the OMD one is just no, it's no off school whatsoever.
[02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:29.460]   What's your pick of the week, Andy?
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:31.340]   One is a long term favorite.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.020]   This is, I have so many of these.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:40.060]   This is the, the Western Digital Easy Store, USB 3 external hard drive.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:45.140]   This is probably, they, this is, I actually bought two over the weekend.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.780]   One is still in the box underneath me and I have, I'm going to count.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:53.620]   I've got one, two, three.
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:55.580]   I've got one attached.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:58.860]   I've got another one attached to my NAS as a backup.
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:04.300]   This new one is going to be the, the, the one that I've attached to my NAS is like the nightly
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:05.300]   backup.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.780]   This one is going to be the weekly backup that's air gapped, meaning that once a week, I connect,
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:13.900]   I connect this, reattach this, do the backup when the backup is done, unplug it.
[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:17.860]   So now nothing can possibly change the data that's on this.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.420]   And the other one is just to be sent to be in the box and waiting in my closet for that
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:27.420]   time when I'm in a dire emergency, that can be, but my, all my problems will be solved
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:32.540]   if I have a fresh eight terabytes of storage, I can basically put everything onto or do a
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:37.140]   full backup of an entire desktop PC onto what I love about these drives is there are
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.300]   no whole bunch of capacities.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:41.460]   Right now the sweet spot for this drive is eight terabytes.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.460]   They're really durable.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:48.260]   They use the same mechanisms that Western digital puts oftentimes in their server machines.
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:53.220]   The, the, these are kind of famous because oftentimes people who run NASs will buy them
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:54.220]   and shock them.
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:58.100]   They'll just like take them apart to get at the mechanism inside and adapt them for use
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:03.660]   in a NAS because in many cases, there are actually really, really, really spec much better than
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:06.220]   a consumer external drive.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:09.140]   And they're really, really cheap.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:13.820]   One of the reasons why I wind up buying so many of them is that you can typically, you
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.180]   can easily buy them for about $150.
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:21.220]   They often go on sale for $130 and sometimes, particularly on back black Friday sort of
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:23.700]   deals, they go for even cheaper than that.
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:30.940]   I, I, I subscribe to the subreddit, a subreddit called Build a PC sales.
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:35.140]   Like there are a whole bunch of Reddit's that subreddit for like looking for tech bargains.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:39.340]   And so when at 4.30, the more nasty that, oh, this is the Western digital eight terabyte
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:42.820]   is, is on sale for $119 at Best Buy.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:44.900]   That's when, okay, I've been waiting for this for four or five months.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:45.900]   I'm going to buy a couple.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:50.460]   So I have one for the purpose that I intended it for and one standing by for when I need
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.260]   one to go for.
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:53.420]   I can't complain about them.
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:56.060]   They're exactly what I want for a desktop drive.
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:58.580]   Again, durable, very, very convenient.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:04.180]   Again, my main desk by there, I've got a bunch of these just like books on a shelf.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:07.420]   And the fact that I just keep buying more and more of them just shows you how much faith
[02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:08.420]   I have of them.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:11.780]   So just to hold on and hold on and wait for them to go on sale because they do go on sale
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.540]   rather regularly.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:15.540]   Awesome.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:19.900]   Miss Lori Gill, you're going to wrap it up with your pick of the week.
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:20.900]   Get out your wallet.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:21.900]   Oh boy.
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:24.700]   I always buy everything you'd recommend.
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:25.700]   What is that?
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.780]   It's a magic R.R. mug.
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:33.060]   It's a Rene Ritchie mug and it's really nice.
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:37.180]   I mean, mug wise, it's just a mug, but the colors and the design.
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:40.700]   The Rene is of it.
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:42.580]   The Rene is, it's gorgeous.
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:43.580]   I love this.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:44.580]   I love the design.
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:47.260]   As soon as Rene got this design, I fell in love with it.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.260]   The logo is fantastic.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:49.260]   It is a great logo.
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:50.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:51.260]   It's a great coloring too.
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:56.020]   It's like this dark blue, almost black but not quite on top of this sort of orange and
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:57.020]   white.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.260]   It's so gorgeous.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.780]   So if even if you don't even watch Rene's videos, it's a good looking product.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:04.940]   People are going to ask you about it.
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.500]   And a mere $15 by five.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:08.500]   Why not?
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:09.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:10.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:11.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.500]   Very cool.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.740]   At standard.tv/collection/Rene-Ritchie.
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:16.740]   Very nice.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:17.740]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.740]   Who did that R.R. again?
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.740]   That's a really good logo.
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:23.820]   Simon Buckmaster at Forgotten towel on Twitter.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:26.020]   He does all the standard enabulous stuff.
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.660]   He's done a lot of the relay stuff too, I think.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:29.660]   He's just beyond fantastic.
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:30.660]   Really nice.
[02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:32.540]   Very well done.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:33.540]   Thank you everybody.
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:37.300]   We have concluded this gripping edition of Macbreak Weekly.
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:42.340]   Rene Ritchie is at youtube.com/Rene Ritchie.
[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:45.940]   Should I be plugging Nebula or what do you, I mean?
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:47.700]   I mean, it's entirely up to you.
[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:50.420]   You just hit 100,000 subscribers this weekend.
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:51.420]   Nice.
[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:52.860]   So we're super, super happy about it.
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:57.980]   Bootstrap, no funding, no VC, no marketing, just a bunch of creators trying to have a silly
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:01.620]   dream of making content without the tyranny of the algorithm.
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:02.620]   Very nice.
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:03.620]   To be afraid of.
[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:04.620]   Wonderful.
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:08.260]   I also want to apologize, Leo, if I was choppy today, but the Skype helper is using 250%
[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.260]   of my CPU right now.
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:10.260]   Oh, she's eating my house.
[02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.420]   I have no idea how to stop it.
[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:12.820]   What is the Skype helper?
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:13.820]   Why do you need to?
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:14.820]   I have no idea.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:15.820]   I've never seen it before.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:19.860]   My activity monitor spiking to 250% of CPU usage.
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:26.180]   I have task our engineering staff to find a replacement for Skype.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:28.380]   This is an exercise in futility.
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:30.340]   We go through every few years.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.820]   We've yet to find something better, but it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:34.820]   I just don't know.
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.620]   Oh my goodness.
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:38.100]   I've got it too.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:44.300]   So Rene and Andy, both of you, I noticed that all three of us were like, we were having
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:46.180]   lag today.
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.940]   They must have updated or something.
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:50.740]   All three of us are experiencing the same issue.
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.980]   I just checked activity monitor.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:52.980]   I'm having the same thing.
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.940]   It was using more than final cuts.
[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:57.500]   I quit everything else on my system and it's still lagging.
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:00.220]   167% of CPU now.
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.220]   87 threads.
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:03.860]   2.3% of GPU.
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:07.700]   Yeah, that's pretty insane.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.700]   There you go.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:11.500]   276% of CPU on me.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:12.980]   There is an article.
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:17.700]   Google Chrome 2.9% and saying, see, it's not always my words and Chrome.
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:19.580]   It's another process.
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:24.860]   There is an article on Medium that Chatham sent me from last year undercover Chris Skype
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:27.780]   helper, high CPU usage.
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:28.780]   And there's a fix.
[02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:31.140]   I don't know if anybody's tried it.
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:32.900]   So it's complicated.
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:34.260]   I won't go through it.
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:35.260]   But it...
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:39.300]   But at least we now understand where it's coming from.
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.260]   Yeah, it's not new either.
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:45.900]   Anyway, I apologize on behalf of Sky.
[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:50.580]   I'm still going to use this as an excuse to upgrade my hardware though.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:51.860]   Yeah, just get a faster.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:57.420]   I'm going to 16-inch MacBook Pro almost maxed out and it's bringing it to its knees.
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:07:58.420]   Final cut doesn't do that.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.420]   There's no reason to...
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:00.740]   Don't ruin this for me.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:06.980]   I definitely need to buy all new Mac hardware and a new screen and a hat.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.420]   Apple Silicon Mac hardware.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:09.420]   That's Andy and Akko.
[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:11.860]   We're going to be on WGBH next.
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:19.100]   As usual Friday at 1 p.m., tune in live or later at either WGBHNews.org or 89.7 on your
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:20.100]   FM dial.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:21.100]   Lovely.
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:25.100]   IHNATKO.com also a not-go on the Twitter.
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:28.940]   Lori Gill is managing editor at imore.com.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:29.940]   Apoholic.
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:33.540]   She's doing the finger stretching exercises, getting ready for Thursday.
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:35.220]   The Apple results.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:39.180]   We will have those for you next Tuesday.
[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.340]   You want a plug, Lori?
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:42.340]   What are you doing these days?
[02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:44.620]   Anything you smoked recently?
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:48.020]   Yeah, we've been smoking lots every single weekend.
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.020]   We smoke something.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.020]   I love my Traeger.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.140]   I thank you for it every week.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:52.620]   I love it too.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:55.260]   It opened up a whole new world for me for real.
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.260]   Smoke beats.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.260]   Smoke beats.
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:58.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:08:59.260]   Meets.
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.260]   Oh, jealous.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.260]   I'm so hungry.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.340]   We can make some billet time for you.
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:03.340]   Anytime.
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.340]   You just ask.
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:05.340]   Yeah.
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:06.340]   I mean, thank you, I.
[02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:07.820]   It'd be so good.
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.700]   We do, Mac, break weekly.
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:10.700]   Let's see.
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:11.700]   Tuesdays, around 11 AM Pacific.
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:17.420]   That's 2 PM Eastern Time, 1800 UTC if you want to stop by and watch as we do the show
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.420]   you can.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:23.340]   There's live stream, audio and video available at twit.tv/live.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.500]   Chatroom is chatting along with us at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:33.980]   You always welcome there 24/7 on-demand versions of the show available at the website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:35.340]   They're also on YouTube.
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:38.660]   They're also, frankly, on your voice assistant.
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:42.140]   You just say, "Hey, Echo, play Mac, break weekly."
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:43.540]   Sometimes you have to say podcasts.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:45.340]   Sometimes you have to say tuning.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:49.420]   I don't know why, but keep trying it till you find this index.
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:53.420]   And that way you'll hear the latest episode whenever you're in the mood.
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:54.700]   Better idea though.
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.580]   Get a podcast application.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:57.580]   Pocket casts.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.700]   We like that a lot.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:09:59.700]   Overcast.
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:00.900]   We like that a lot.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:01.900]   Google has one.
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:02.900]   Apple has one.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:03.900]   Stitcher.
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:04.900]   Slacker.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:05.900]   And subscribe.
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:09.820]   That way you'll get the show the minute it's available automatically.
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:11.500]   You don't even have to think about it.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.900]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:17.060]   Back to work though now because break time is over.
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:18.060]   Bye bye.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:19.060]   Want more twit?
