[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Ritchie is here. Andy Enocho is here. Alex Lindsey is stopping by.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.000]   So of course the very first thing I had to ask was how professionals feel about Apple's supposed move to arm.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.200]   Next year we also talked about a brand new 13 inch Mac book pro. In fact, we'll help you decide which one to buy.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.600]   And then we're going to talk about streaming video and how to make it look better.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.000]   There's actually a ton to talk about.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Also, Tim Cook's amazing graduation speech too. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Stay here. Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twits LastPass Studios.

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Rotating in some hosts here, rotating out other hosts just for the week.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Alex Lindsey is in for Lori Gill. We so rarely get a chance to have Alex on.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   He's very busy.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We're thrilled to have you. Hello, Alex.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Lots of questions for you also with us, Andy Ennaco from Boston Public Radio.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And from Renee Richie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   The eponymous.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Allow me.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Renee Richie. Allow me to myself to introduce to me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   One of the reasons, last week, there's all sorts of mechanisms.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We'll get to it a second.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   But last week we spent some time talking about ARM and the Mark Gurman rumor that by next
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   year, Apple would start putting out Macintosh computers based on their own ARM chip designs.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   And one of the things missing was you, Alex, because as a pro who really needs high-end
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.000]   machines with, at least at this point, Zions in them.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I was wondering what you would say to the idea, should Apple go slow and keep making Pentium,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm sorry, Intel-based machines?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Or should they go in all in on ARM over the next couple of years?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Well, I think that the laptops are probably pretty valid, especially the Airs and the smaller
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   laptops to move to ARM.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I think that the average user is probably able to do it.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I think we have to see whether we see an attempt to do more than iMovie on, obviously, on the
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   iPad or the things like that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Are you doing 4K and 8K video production at this point?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Most of our productions are 4K for post-production.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Right.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And then our live is still typically 1080p.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   We are doing a little bit of 4K, but most of the live stuff is still 1080p.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So the existing stuff's fast.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You didn't buy a Mac Pro, you didn't need one.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I haven't yet.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   No, I haven't had a project that needed it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   But as I looked at the trajectory of where I was trying to, where we're going, I thought
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   that I was going to have to leave the Mac platform altogether to do the higher-end work because
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   it just wasn't scalable.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Until the new Mac Pro came out, it just looked like there was a dead end of where we could
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   go.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I was kind of preparing to the next big, you know, because we've definitely spent $20,000,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   $30,000 on Linux boxes and Windows boxes that we do really high-end streaming.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   We're putting four graphics cards into it and the biggest chips we can find and everything
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   else.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And I felt like inevitably we were going to have to do the same thing with, you know, some
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   of the editing and everything else.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Now I don't have that concern.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.500]   So while I haven't bought a Mac Pro yet, I definitely am just waiting for the job that
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.640]   justifies a Mac Pro to kind of move that direction.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   So I think that that high-scale, Apple saying that we are going to build a piece of hardware
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.080]   that you can absolutely scale to your needs is really important for the entire ecosystem.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   As people start to decide, you know, what platform, what software that they're going
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.760]   to commit to, they have to know that, well, this keeps on getting bigger.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.680]   And I actually take it to its end result.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.400]   Otherwise they start building on other platforms.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   And so that the existence of a no-holds bar, we can do whatever we need to do is important
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.280]   even for the laptops and for the smaller machines and the iMacs because you're betting on it.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.760]   So I think that that's important.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.800]   I don't think that those are going away anytime soon.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.400]   I think that there's going to be a Mac Pro, a MacBook Pro.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.740]   I think that the iMac Pro and even maybe the iMac as well as the Mac Pros are still some
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.280]   things that are going to sit on Intel for quite some time.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.460]   But I do think that we could see the iPad Pros obviously are still already there.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.100]   But I think we could see some of the smaller laptops.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.420]   Now the question is, is when you're now adding keyboards and mice to your iPad Pro, do you
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.760]   need to change the laptops?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   You know, is there some point where you just stop making errors and you have iPads and
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.720]   full-on MacBook Pros that are doing something bigger?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   I mean, the MacBook Pro I think is important on the Intel platform because there's still
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.100]   a lot of heavy lifting.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.660]   I still have an older machine sitting with Mojave because I have old 32-bit stuff that
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.660]   I need to run.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.900]   So there's things that are going to take a long time to fully move over.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.420]   I think we're still probably looking at five to ten years before we see something completely
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.820]   migrate away.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.380]   But I do think that we could see in the smaller, I think where you'd start with that is the
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.580]   smaller laptops would probably be the first thing that might go towards an arm chip.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.160]   I don't know whether it makes sense to do that or just continue to develop the iPad to
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.920]   a point where it replaces it.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   I mean, it's not there yet.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.160]   Some of the I/O and everything else with the iPads are not quite ready for that.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.760]   But I think that they're moving the right direction.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.600]   Yeah, I feel like that makes sense.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   So you see a divide between Pro and non-Pro, whether it's iOS or Mac OS.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.360]   I mean, I think that if you look at what the average person does with the smaller laptops,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   the air type laptop.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.120]   I don't need anything anymore in the ear.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   I don't know why.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.600]   If you're doing an air and now that you have a keyboard and you have a mouse, maybe not
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.220]   in this first version, but in two or three more versions or maybe one or two more versions
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.300]   of iOS and the trajectory we're seeing with the iPads, I don't know why you would want
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.880]   to, why you'd want an air instead of an iPad.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.480]   The iPad is going to be much better.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   I like this.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.920]   It is in fact faster now than it in the iPad.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   The iPad Pro, right?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.480]   Then the 2020 Mac book.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.480]   Absolutely.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   I think so.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.640]   And for me, one of the things, and I've just started playing with the keynote now with
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   the keyboard.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.160]   The funny thing about it is that I start, so I build three to five decks, keynote decks
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.720]   a week for this is what your show is going to look like.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.240]   This is what we're planning and this is how we're doing it.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.120]   And they all start on my iPad.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.280]   So I open up keynote and I have my pencil and I just draw out every really chicken scratches
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.920]   of this is what my slides are going to look like because it keeps me from getting distracted
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.240]   by trying to find photos and trying to line things up.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.680]   I just get my ideas out.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.600]   You put a lot of the iPad.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.360]   Stream of consciousness, get it all out of my head.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.840]   Then I go back and fill it all in.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.520]   Now I take that to the computer because it's been faster from a mouse and mouseing perspective
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   and everything else.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.320]   It's faster to grab what I need off the, you know, on my computer.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.040]   So it's easier on my iMac to finish the deck.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.880]   At some point that UI is going to make it easier.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.080]   There's little things like for instance the interplay between copying images off the web.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.720]   So if I'm doing some kind of example image and I want to grab something, a logo, a product
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:13.040]   picture, that type of thing and throw it into a slide deck that in, you know, on my iPad
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.400]   is not as seamless as doing it in, you know, on my computer.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.960]   So there's all these little workloads.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.600]   I like what you're saying and your perspective is actually really valuable that you need
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.880]   to continue them from the simplest, the most powerful.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.080]   It's hard for a single company to do that.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.480]   That's the real challenge for Apple.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   They're one company, the only company that makes iOS and Mac OS.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.480]   So they've got to do, they've got to offer this product line, which is a challenge for
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   any one company.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.720]   And what, what's amazing is all that integration between the hardware because I will work on
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   obviously you do it on the iPad and then move it to a Mac Pro easily.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.880]   I got my legs up sitting on the deck, you know, having some tea and writing out a deck.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   And I come in by the time I get into my office and I sit down in front of my iMac, that is
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.240]   available on my iCloud.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.520]   My iCloud, I just open the keynote there and start working away.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.560]   You know, so that continuity between the two is has become just a key part of what I
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   do every day.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.400]   That kind of horizontal and vertical integration is something Apple could really excel at because
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.480]   they own the hardware, especially if you go all arm at some point, because then they own
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.600]   all the hardware and all the software.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.720]   And it's still why I'm a pretty strong advocate of using Final Cut is because they make the
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.960]   hardware and the software.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.600]   And so, you know, we know that Final Cut is able to take full advantage of the Pro, you
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.440]   know, the Mac Pro as far as being able to scale.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   And as we start moving into larger frames like 8K and more VR, more AR, that type of thing,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   it's nice to know that the hardware that you're working in, you know, is directly supporting
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.760]   the software that you're working.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.000]   And that takes us directly to today because yesterday Apple pushed out by press release,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.560]   the new 13-inch Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, which a lot of people had hoped would have the new
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.920]   Magic Keyboard.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   It does.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.760]   It's got the new, at least by the high-end, 10th generation Intel chips.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   Renee, have you had a chance to play with this at all?
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.280]   No, I just learned as much as I could about it now.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   Right.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.520]   This is something a lot of people said, "I'm not buying the MacBook Air.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   I wish I had said that.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   I'm not buying the MacBook Air.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.240]   I'm waiting for the 13-inch."
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.640]   And finally, I think, Andy, you probably would agree with this.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.480]   This is the death knell for the butterfly keyboard, right?
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.400]   It's clear now Apple's not going to...
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.080]   It's like I was saying a while ago, Apple doesn't apologize.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.520]   They apologize.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.280]   They admit they made a mistake by you.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.000]   They banished this to the land of ghosts and winds and you never hear from it again.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   And the fact that on the 13-inch, that they're going all the way to Scissors switches, not
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.440]   only that, but this also has a physical escape key.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.720]   It also has a T-based arrow keys.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.200]   They confessed to a lot of sins and they've done a lot of Hail Marys, clearly, in releasing
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   this thing.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.080]   The only disappointment is that you don't get the 10th generation.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.960]   If my reading is correct, like Renee said, I've just been reading about it.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.200]   You only get the 10th generation CPUs with the highest end machines.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   Yes, it's spent so money.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200]   You get it.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   You get the eighth generation.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.320]   Like Intel, I'm not sure if they doubled the price, but they got close to doubling the
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.920]   price for those CPUs over the previous ones.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.680]   So it would add 300, 400, and Apple doesn't buy just the normal ones.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   They shipped everybody else.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.720]   They take the top of the bin, top of the bin, top of the bin.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.280]   And then by the way, can you change the motherboards like this?
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:36.680]   So they can suck that up at the higher end point, but it would have blown up the bill of goods
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   for the--
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.400]   And the difference in performance, I forget, someone was running the test.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.760]   There is almost zero difference in CPU performance between the eighth gen and the 10th gen, because
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.560]   Intel has just been at such a roadblock.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   Well, then what do you get?
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   The graphics is a big deal.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.680]   It's the Iris Plus graphics.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   When you bump up to the more expensive chips, then it starts to make a difference.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680]   But also the--
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   Oh, and I wish Renee had Iris Plus graphics right now, because he seems to be frozen.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.080]   Yeah, if we look at Apple's price chart, you could just throw out the two columns to the
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.120]   left, because those are the old eighth generation ones.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.360]   They made a big deal about it.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.560]   It starts at $12.99.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.400]   But really, if you want a 10th generation, even just an I5, $1,800.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   Well, then also--
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   And the 16 gigs of RAM, 512 gigs of storage, that does finally offer 32 gigs of RAM, which
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.280]   I'm very happy to see, because Apple solders these on the motherboard.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.680]   There's no opportunity to upgrade after the fact.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   But now with 16 gigs of RAM, the I5, I'm at $21.99.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.720]   Well, and I think that one of the things that is really important that we've found with
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.240]   the two USB-C port is we're just constantly-- we have to have an adapter.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.520]   That might be the biggest thing on this, is it's got four, right?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   It's got two on each side.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   Four is key.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   Yeah, four is key.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   The 13 before that was all two on one side, and it just was a real bummer.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.880]   And so having four on-- I would not get one with just two.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.760]   I'm literally thinking of upgrading from the brand new MacBook Air I just got, because
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.720]   finally I could plug it in on the right instead of just the left.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.920]   But having four is nice, too.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.360]   Yeah, I've always said that the-- I think one of the differences between the pro line
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.720]   and the rest is that as you get into the pro line, you should have to suffer less than
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   you would.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   You should have to--
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   You should have to--
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   Except for your bank account.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   Except for your bank account.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Of course.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   That's going to suffer.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.280]   So they do go up to four terabytes.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.760]   It'll cost you an additional $1,200.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.960]   And Renee, these are T2 based chips on the motherboard, right?
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   These are not--
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   Yes.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   This is not upgradable.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.120]   So you can't do as I've done.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.720]   For instance, I got a Dell XPS 2020 Dell XPS 13.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.480]   It came with a ridiculous, I think, 256 gig RAM, but I could open it up, put in a different
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.320]   M2 card, and go up to two terabytes for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.640]   You can't do that with Apple.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.120]   So you've got to sneak it out for the way you want it, right?
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.440]   And I am not a fan of putting four terabytes into it.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   That seems like a lot.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   Well, here's the thing is that's a lot that is on your computer if you lose it, if it
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.360]   breaks, if you have to send it in for repair, those are all things that I worry about having
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   that much.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.800]   I'd much rather have some version of external source to keep some of those items.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.560]   These four connectors is a lot easier to have an external drive hanging out.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.440]   I'm the opposite because Final Cut has gotten, I don't know if it's maybe Alex uses Final
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.960]   Cut way better than I do, but I've turned off everything.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.120]   I've turned off all the rendering.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.320]   I've turned off all the extra files it makes.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.760]   And some videos that they'll start off at 200 gigabytes.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.280]   And then the next thing I look down, I'm getting memory errors, 600 gigabytes being
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.120]   used, the terabyte being used.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   And I don't know what's still as the blend.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.560]   It still has to build those render files.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.160]   I mean, or I've never seen it not build the render files.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.720]   And so as you're doing things and you're stacking them up, you're going to build up
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.800]   those render files.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.600]   And I clean them out pretty regularly.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   >> Me too.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.360]   But I buy enough now.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.080]   I get two terabytes to four terabytes, not to keep a lot of stuff on there, but just
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.000]   so that I never have to worry if I'm stuck anywhere.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.160]   I can at least get one video, maybe two videos made before I export over that text circle.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.480]   >> I think the challenge I have is that it's like a bag.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.240]   The bigger the bag is, the more stuff I put in.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.080]   So I get what keeps me spartan is to keep my internal drive at a certain rate, at a certain
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.000]   size so that I don't start adding things and leaving them.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.600]   Although the biggest thing right now is me, the massive iPhoto library is the single largest
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.040]   drive space that I got.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.640]   >> I left that on my hand.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.920]   I took it right off my MacBook.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.800]   >> It's so hard for me to give it up.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   It's like this thing that's that I have my photos everywhere.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   And so I'm going to probably give it up and put it somewhere.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.880]   >> It's hard to predict what your storage is going to be, especially with one of the
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.600]   hidden bumbers of buying MacBooks is that the things they last so damn long.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.000]   If you can keep like DiPepsi off the keyboard, you can expect to get like five, six, seven,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   eight, nine years out of it.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.320]   And so the thing that you maybe you say, well, I don't do 3D renders.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.440]   I don't do 4K or 8K video.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.960]   But maybe five years from now, you actually do do all that stuff.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.160]   And suddenly you're hitting the ceiling on an SSD.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:32.560]   But I've sort of had to give up on hoping that you're going to get like M2 replaceable
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.760]   modules inside user, user upgradable modules inside a MacBook.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.840]   What still remains is just the worry that again, if you're going to be using this for
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.400]   eight or nine years, the likelihood that your SSD will fail at some point.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   And now you're not looking at, okay, we'll big deal.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.360]   I order a new $110 module that's probably twice the capacity of what I originally had
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   in there.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.760]   Now it's no, unfortunately, we need to do a motherboard swap.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.160]   And oh, unfortunately, now the motherboard is inexplicitly molded into like the keyboard.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.840]   So now we're also going to have to give you a top deck and it's it really is disheartening
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.120]   when you get a bill for $900 to replace.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.280]   So what is an effect, a $100 part?
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.960]   Let me talk a little bit about ice lake versus coffee like so half of these have coffee like
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.240]   the eighth generation Intel processors.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.400]   Half of them have ice lake, the 10th generation.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   I guess you just skip right then.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.440]   But you said something I thought was kind of interesting that there's not a heck of a
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   lot of difference between the two.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.520]   There is a difference between the two machines.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.840]   For instance, you can't get 32 gigs of RAM unless you get a sleep abilities are much higher
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   on.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.160]   It's DDR4 and if you get coffee, like you're going to get DDR3.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.200]   Well, no, because coffee lake, yeah, but you can get the low power version because it
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.520]   caps at 16 gigabytes.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.480]   It was over 16 gigabytes that you couldn't get the low power version.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   Right.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.840]   So why they want DDR4.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.960]   There is a demarcation between the lower end new MacBook Pro 13s and the higher.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.360]   I hate to put it this way, but like for me, like the top of the line air, the bottom line
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.040]   MacBook Pro are very similar in terms of capabilities.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.760]   Now the air has slightly bigger graph, better graphics.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.920]   The pro has a better display and also because it's a bigger chassis, it has slightly better
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   thermals.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.720]   So it doesn't burst as high as the air, but it's not quite as snappy, but it does sustain
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.400]   a little bit longer.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.720]   But I think if you self identify as a pro, and I know it's really contentious because
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.880]   pros are like Southerners.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.800]   Anybody a block north is a northerner.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.320]   Anybody who's like one town north is upstate New York.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.200]   Doesn't matter where you live in New York.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   The next town is upstate.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.320]   Whatever your workload is and more is a pro and anybody who's not doing what you're doing,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   not a pro.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.440]   But they're a whole new generation of people who are founders and they just self identify
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.680]   as a pro.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.440]   That's why Apple sold so many of those beleaguered.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.920]   We couldn't believe it because these are not our traditional pro machines.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.200]   They sold hot cakes to people who wanted, who like aspired to be pros.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.160]   And I think we see people with ad sales with the pro.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   And I'm always like, I wonder what they're doing with that.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.520]   Like, like, what would they, you know, they're, I guess they're short.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.920]   And I want it.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   That's what they're doing.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.120]   And I think that's why you have the lower end, you know, of the pro.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.040]   Just so you could still say it's a pro.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.880]   The screen you said is slightly better.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.200]   It's a high one.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.760]   It's brighter and it's DC IP three wider gamut as opposed to sRGB on the air.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.680]   But roughly the same screen size is the MacBook Air.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.160]   Exactly the thicker, thicker chassis.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.040]   Better battery life, one would hope, but maybe not.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.360]   The air gets 10% better battery life than the pro just because it's, it's, it's not,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.480]   it's not running as heavy amount of stuff.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   Right.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.960]   You do get an escape key.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   Hallelujah.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.200]   You also get a touch bar.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.840]   Oh, well, at least you get an escape key.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   I don't mind.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.720]   At least clarify if I have an escape key.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.880]   It doesn't cost you as much to have a touch bars.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   I do.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.000]   The Iris Plus graphics, which I have on my Dell, are quite good.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.160]   I think they're not Radeon, but they're, but they're pretty darn good for.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.160]   And it just, in this kind of chassis too, like what you're giving up into discrete graphics,
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.480]   you're getting in better thermal envelope for the CPU and the, and the intake integrated
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   graphics.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   Could you still use an EGPU?
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   Of course you could.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   Yes.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.840]   So if you needed a specially fast graphics processor, you could do that.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.560]   And the good, and the good news there, it can be that you need that graphics processor
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   at home, you don't necessarily need it when you're going somewhere else.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.120]   And so the ability to have a lot more processing speed when you're, when you're working.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.760]   Now one thing we've seen with the EGPU is for some things for live thing and other things
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.320]   you have to put what we've learned is you have to put the application screen actually
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.000]   on a screen that's using the EGPU or it doesn't fully access it.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Oh, that's very strange.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Something to think about.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.240]   And more most importantly, and Alex, you'll probably know this, can I have my own zoom
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.440]   backgrounds on this one?
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.720]   You can, but I wouldn't.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.160]   Just because you can use this virtual background doesn't mean you should use a virtual background.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.000]   Have you seen the, like the power draw of zoom when it's running in Chrome with full
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.440]   backgrounds going on a Mac?
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   Oh, I don't think about it.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.160]   It's like more than final cut more than you should never use it in Chrome.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   I mean, it's the app is not, I think that the zoom in your, in your in Chrome or in Firefox
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.840]   or whatever is kind of like, yes, sure, we'll give it to you.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.720]   Like, you know, like WebRTC if you're doing it that way.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   So it's, but it's not WebRTC.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   If you're using the zoom app, it's a, it's a, it is a variant of WebRTC.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.840]   It's not actually WebRTC, but it's pretty close.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   I mean, they're still using it.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.600]   They're just using some more.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.760]   They're hacking it a little bit to traverse complex.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.520]   The problem that WebRTC has is that it doesn't traverse complex internal networks.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.680]   So once it comes off the way in into the land, if it bounces through a couple routers,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.760]   you have to use a turn server to do it.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.920]   And so WebRTC has a little trouble with that.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.480]   And so you end up with lower video quality because it just can't figure it out or it
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.880]   can't, it's, it's not that it can't figure it out.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   It's that it won't.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.200]   It's trying to be a good neighbor.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.600]   Whereas, whereas, you know, zoom is like, hey, we just want to have good video and Skype
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   is the same way.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   Skype is like, Hey, I don't care.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   I'm going to do it.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   I'm going to do it.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   I'm going to do it.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   I'm going to be a bad neighbor.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.200]   But that's, you know, Skype, if you put Skype into everybody, this is one of the problems
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.800]   that you put it into a big company and it really causes a lot of havoc because it just
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.840]   ignores all those rules and says, I'm going to take whatever I can take.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:38.680]   And you know, so WebRTC is a better, a better, you know, member of the community for IT.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.800]   But the result is that you can end up with a lot of video degradation if it's using it
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   that way.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.880]   So, and, and again, there's a lot of feature sets inside of zoom that aren't obviously
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   we're using zoom a lot.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.840]   So, so you learn a lot about zoom as you, as you work on it.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   So there's a lot of feature sets inside of the app that you're not going to get full
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.960]   access to inside of the browser.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.720]   So there is a $200 difference when you get to the ice lake, the 10th generation processors
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.240]   between the I five and the I seven who should get the I five who should not.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.320]   Is there a clear demarcation there?
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   Most people should get the I five if you happen to do a lot of things where you benefit.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.280]   So like just to go back for a second turbo boost, what it means today is not what it
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   used to mean.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.760]   When Intel talks about turbo boost now, the way I describe it is it's frosting.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   It's not cake.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   It's something that's designed to give you extreme burst performance for very, very short
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.640]   periods of time, but you know, maybe over and over again.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.120]   So like only ever by a computer based on base frequencies don't even look at the turbo
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.640]   boost considered an extreme bonus.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.400]   So if you know that you're doing a lot of things like things that benefit from really
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.000]   rapid performance, like opening tons of tabs, opening tons of apps, doing very like a lot
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.200]   of small calculations over and over again, those things will add up.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.120]   People just feel much snappier to you because they're more powerful.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.480]   They'll ramp down faster though.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.380]   So you'll get like an initial spike on a render, but then it'll ramp down and sort of spike
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.760]   up and down as best it can to manage the thermal load around like a hundred degrees.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.280]   Apple has no qualms about running it thermal maximum on any of these devices.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.000]   So so degree Celsius.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Yeah, Celsius.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Sorry.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Forget what that is.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Freedom units.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   It's much hotter.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   2012.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Okay.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.040]   So where you could boil water, let's put it like in a relative.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   Boiling.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.400]   So get the I five unless you really, really, really, really, really know that and I don't
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.000]   even think there's more multiple core benefit on this one.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.840]   No, they're both on a little more L three cache six megabits on the I five to eight
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   minute.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.360]   But on the six and I'd say the cores could help you depending on your workload.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.960]   But here I think you're stuck in our course.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.080]   It's all quad all the way down actually.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.360]   What I will say is it's something that we're seeing a lot of people dealing with right
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   now.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.040]   And so the only the only side of that that I would push back on a little bit is that
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.880]   it depends on what industry you're in and basically any in any industry that's touching
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.320]   information right now because of the current situation.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.680]   The ability to produce video, audio, graphics for almost everybody is becoming more intense
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.520]   or more needed because now you have to, you know, teachers that have to that didn't know
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.960]   that they were going to have to produce their entire course load for their students, you
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.320]   know, on their computer, you have sales people who no longer can meet anybody in person
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.480]   and really have to be able to sell something.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.200]   So what we want to what when you think about what you what you might be doing with your
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.920]   computer in the future, remember that you may need to do a lot more with it than you
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.960]   did six weeks ago.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.000]   You know, and so as far as and I think that this there's an incredible need where it's
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.800]   reading, writing arithmetic and media that's coming fast, you know, where you really need
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.880]   to be able to be fluid with that.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.920]   Is that clock speed, cores, RAM, what are the more important?
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   It's graphics.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.360]   Well, I mean, the for rendering, of course, the the difference between the i5 and the i7
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.920]   will be pretty dramatic.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.640]   Graphics of course, because of threading hyper threading.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.160]   I mean, it's just going to use up the rendering is going to use up as much as the CPU can
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   give it.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.920]   So it's, you know, you're going to and you can be less than the i5.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.840]   So you might not get as much throttling on the i5.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.440]   You might, but it depends on also what you do with the back of the of your computer.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:22.720]   A lot of us, when I render, if I know that I'm rendering off of my off my laptop, a lot
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.400]   of times I'll set it on something that just gives it a little bit more air to try to,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   you know, get away from that.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.080]   So, you know, if you're conscious to it, it is something that that does make a difference.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.120]   And so, so a lot of those things are going to be important.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.480]   And again, right now you might not need that, but what we're seeing, you know, we're at
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.000]   a moment in time that's going to be changing pretty dramatically.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.880]   And I think that the need to for many people in many industries to suddenly be able to
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.400]   do more video production, whether that's audio, video, live, all those things are going
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.760]   to be make a break for both businesses and also people's, you know, careers.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.360]   So it's important to think about that when you spend, you know, if you're going to spend
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.760]   an extra couple hundred dollars on your computer for a faster processor, it might be worth
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.280]   thinking about because you may end up doing a lot more of it than you did again, six weeks
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.280]   ago.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.880]   How about RAM, 32 gigs?
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.160]   Well, first is the ER3 or four matter.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.000]   And then second, should I, you have to get to your four and the faster processors.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.720]   The ice like processors, if you want 32 gigs.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.120]   Who needs 32 gigs?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   It lots of virtual machines.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   Okay.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.360]   I mean, the reason, yeah.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   I think that, you know, there's definitely tools that I use that want 32 gigs, but I don't,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.320]   I've been able to do most of the stuff I've done on my laptop on 16.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.760]   So I don't think it's that it's, it's as critical.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.520]   It does help to have more RAM if you're going to start stacking stuff up.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.440]   But I, but I definitely like, if I'm doing photogrammetry, for instance, I stack, you
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.840]   know, I run out of 32 really fast.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.040]   But if I'm doing regular video processing and so on and so forth, I don't, I don't usually
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   run.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.640]   So what you're saying is if you need 32, you probably really need 64.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.280]   Well, you need 30.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.760]   If you need 32 though, but, but I'm saying 16 is like a no, you can't, can't go there.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.400]   But there's a lot of things I don't even try on my Mac.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.320]   We know that Alex photogrammetry is, yeah.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.800]   We did the, did you just do, yeah, you saw just, yeah.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.600]   So, you know, how to max it.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.040]   So the, but, but I think that it, it, it, again, it's just to think about that a little
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.720]   bit further out as Andy said, the thing with these computers is they last a long time.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.280]   And so when you think about our trajectory of four or five or six years, think about
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.360]   the kind of things you might do with it as you go through that process.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   That go to 16.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.880]   That's my recommendation for most people.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.040]   It's to do 16.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.840]   For a hundred bucks, I think 16 is if you can afford it.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   But not to 32.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   You have the money.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   You save me money.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   I'm saying how much.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.280]   I think when you start to get to the top limits of any machine, you sort of know, like you
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.440]   move from like, I'm not sure to, oh, yeah, I need 32.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   Right.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   No, I would, I would agree.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.080]   If you don't know if you're going to need it, I would say 16 is probably fine.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.520]   So I'm going to get the I five.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.880]   I'm going to get the 16.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.840]   The computers are really good at memory compression and they're really, and the SSDs are so fast
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.040]   that and the way Apple use it for swap, you know, a lot of people because of the limitations
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.360]   of Intel, they were forced to make swap almost indistinguishable from RAM for a lot of tasks.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.240]   How much storage Alex says don't get for.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.920]   It sure is expensive to get for.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.200]   I'm a big fan of one.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   One's a nice thing.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   I think I was a little, a little thin, but I'm a big fan of one.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.640]   So that's a $2,000 laptop you just picked out.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.520]   That's you know what?
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.920]   What is the premium on that compared?
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.320]   My Dell was $1,400 with a, and then I had a $200 hard drive.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.360]   So two terabyte $200 hard drive.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   So that's $1,600 bucks.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.400]   I probably, I probably could have been the extra $200 bucks on the, on the faster processor
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   myself.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   Really?
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.800]   Instead of the, it's the bigger drive.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.600]   I, I, uh, yeah.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.840]   No, I would absolutely.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.800]   So this is essentially what I got with the Dell for, for $1,600.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.000]   It's $1,000 more if you get it from Apple.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.240]   That's a pretty stiff premium, but you're getting Mac OS.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.840]   You'd also have to check every component because like the biggest difference is that
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.360]   Dell will, like if you don't think SSDs are that important, but you still want one, you
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   can get a cheap SSD with Dell and you can't with Apple.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.080]   You can get lower.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.800]   And Apple again bins for like the very best of the best of every part possible where other
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.160]   manufacturers are like, for 500 bucks, you get like the 80% one for 200 bucks to get
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.600]   the 60% one.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   They're fine with that.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.840]   A lot of people are fine with that with Apple.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.000]   Your only choice is like the top of the line of everything.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Right.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.280]   That does bring up the point that when you're shopping around like this, you should really
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.680]   think of your budget as a bit, be a bit more imaginative than simply saying, I've got a
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   $2,000 budget.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.360]   I'm going to give it all to Apple.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   It's very, very possible.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:51.840]   The best way to spend that money is to give $14.99 to Apple, spend $500 on things like what
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.640]   once once you have done a really good audit of how you expect to use this machine and
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:02.280]   how you work through the day, maybe the better way to spend the extra $500 is with a really,
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:10.520]   really good color balanced HD monitor and an arm for your desk or add in a really, really
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.160]   nice external keyboard for when you're using this back at home as opposed to when you're
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.200]   using it in a hotel room.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.320]   And that's what I usually go through every time that I'm about to unleash $2,000 with
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.840]   the hounds on solving that productivity problem.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:32.640]   Here's the good news for that 1999, you can also get a $4,000 pro XDR display because
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.720]   the higher end, not all of them, but the higher end MacBook Pros 13s will run the XDR display.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   That's a good thing.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   Well, I'm sold now.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   Like now I'm ready.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   Are you really?
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   Is that it?
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   That's over?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   It's all you need to know.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   Can you get wheels for this new 13-ish pro?
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   How much?
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   Oh my gosh.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   Where's that video?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.360]   Just putting the Mac Pro wheels on the bottom of your Mac.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   That would be, we need that.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   I'm not bad.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.600]   I don't know if she put it out.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.800]   But Justine was doing a video and apparently it's non-trivial because of how tightly everything
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.640]   is put together in the angles and everything to get those wheels on there.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   So just make a go-card instead.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.440]   You'll be happy, YouTube will be happy, but I'll be happy.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   I don't want wheels because I don't want it to roll out of my office into somebody
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   else's car.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.880]   So no wheels for me.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   That'll save me so many.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.240]   People are the people in the studio looking at you hungrily, Leo?
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Are they like, "Can't get the wheels."
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.040]   I'm not ordering anything.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.000]   In fact, I kind of, I knew that the 13 was probably coming, but I really wanted that
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.040]   MacBook Air and I ordered that and I probably don't see any reason that I don't have it.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.160]   Well, so the thing to remember with this MacBook Pro is that my guess is that this, like because
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.280]   a lot of people are like, "Oh, why is this the Mac?"
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.840]   My guess is that if this was a normal year, the products we'd be seeing would not necessarily
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.800]   be different from an iOS point of view, but I think from a Mac point of view because iOS
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.680]   just has tons of resources and lots and lots of bandwidth that if Apple had its drawers,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.960]   maybe this MacBook would have turned out a little bit differently, but they realized
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.080]   they had to get the magic keyboard into everything.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   They couldn't wait any longer.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.560]   It was ready to go.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.120]   And the amount of resources they had and given everything that's going on with COVID and
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.880]   all those things, any bonus stuff they could put into it, any stuff that was already ready,
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.480]   that was great, but they had to ship it.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.400]   So these are the sort of, we didn't get any mythical 14-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.560]   We didn't get any really weird new stuff.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.680]   We got here are your magic keyboards and anything else we managed to slip inside on the way.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.120]   And tell me how good that eyesight cameras.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   Terrible.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.680]   It's like a person of potato.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   Why?
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.680]   Why Apple?
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   Why?
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.280]   I did a video comparing that every MacBook camera from the 2015, all the up to the 2017
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.400]   iMac Pro is the only one with a decent 1080p.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.160]   Yeah, I have the iMac Pro camera and actually it is good.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   It's very good.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160]   It's good.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160]   All the other Mac cameras are terrible.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   They're 720p.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.440]   They would take a camera bump at this point.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.200]   I love the iPad camera, but it's on the side.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.080]   So I just don't have a decent large sized Apple device with which to do teleconferencing
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   and not either look like I'm stuck in some 1980s pixelated drama or that I'm secretly
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.360]   looking off to the side and not paying attention to you.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.920]   Well, we've had a lot of discussions about that.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   And my whole thing is, is that if the camera matters to you, I just, we have prepped between
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   four and 5,000 people in the last 10 years for remote, you know, doing what we're doing
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   here, right?
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.820]   For events.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.120]   And what I've learned is that the average person just can't see it.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.920]   So Apple investing into a really nice, you know, camera, you know, I get the model just
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.240]   because we've dealt with it so much they come on Dell and they think it's going to look
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   fine.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.120]   And the Dell ones for a long time, I don't know what they look like recently, but they
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.800]   would look like they were coming through coffee, you know, on the way through the contrast.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   It's so bad.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.960]   And we could literally, we, oh, you're on a Dell.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.440]   Like you could literally look at it and know that it was Dell because it was so bad.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.960]   And so my whole thing is, is that there's a handful of us that really care and we have
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.440]   external web cameras.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.080]   You have a, what are you using?
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.600]   Because you look, you look marvelous.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.400]   You think I read?
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.680]   Well, look at them.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   I'm not using a red.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.760]   I'm using, I have put, I am using a black magic black magic.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   So, so you could be 60 if you wanted to.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.640]   He could use the ARRI, but he's just, he's roughing it with the black magic.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.440]   No, no, no, the, but, but like something like this, this is what we send the people, right?
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   These stream, well, when we could buy it.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.440]   What is that?
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.440]   Exactly.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.360]   This is the two, the two, the two ones that we use the most are the, are the C920s and
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   the stream decks.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   Okay.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   And these are both Logitech.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.320]   Logitech really kind of owns the good camera.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.200]   The problem is they don't have any in stock right now.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.560]   Well, they're being scalped at three times the normal price is terrible.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.040]   I've been, I've been spelunking through my, through my garage and I found like six Logitech's
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   like in a bag.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.920]   I'm in my office at fantasy nine, ten.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.520]   I thought, I know, I keep them.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.520]   I keep them.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.040]   And so I've been mailing them out to clients because it's like, you look horrible.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.480]   Let me send you this.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.280]   And, and so I've got like this little stash of, of external until, until Logitech sorts
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.720]   out their, their, supply chain.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.920]   But, but the, the thing is, is that there's just such a small percentage of people that
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.160]   can see the difference.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.960]   I mean, they just really don't.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.760]   And, and then you go, you take that camera that doesn't look good already and you put
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.800]   it into something like zoom or into meat.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.840]   And it's getting compressed down to where it's really hard to tell the difference and
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.360]   the final product between it, it, it, it, you can see it if you know what you're looking
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.480]   for, but it really does become, you're kind of shaving it at hairs to tell the difference
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.320]   between the two, the two cameras.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.200]   And so I think that that's the problem is that we just don't use them at that, at that
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   level very much.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.560]   For those of us who care, we also want a quarter 20 on the bottom so that we can, we can attach
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.920]   it to a tripod and we want, you know, other things.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.560]   And so there's a bunch of other things that we want and that doesn't make sense to invest
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.360]   in from a manufacturer who's having one installed.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.960]   They put one in like, Hey, here, here it is.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.080]   You've got one that works.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.000]   If you need it, it's there.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.480]   If you want something better, then you buy something and plug it in, you know, and, and
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.560]   I, I kind of respect it only because of the stuff that work that we've done and realize
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.120]   that nobody could tell that.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.320]   You know, and just very few people can tell the difference.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.640]   And you think it, we, when you think like me, you know, I want, obviously, I don't even
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.800]   think a webcam is, is good enough, but, but, you know, I don't expect much from my, from
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   my internal one.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   Yeah, actually, I want to sit up a studio at home and I think I'm probably just going
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.760]   to use, I think I can use a Sony a sevens.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.960]   I have to get some dummy bad.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   You can.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.320]   And this is the cannons just added USB out last year.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   Yeah, that's funky though.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.120]   And you have to use windows, which I refuse to do.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   Uh, good.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.320]   What do you know, the, you know, the sevens will be coming soon.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   Into this it does.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   So we've had, we have people are.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   Yes.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   That's what I'm going to use.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   An eight, 10 mini and I've got three.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.440]   I've got an a seven, two and a seven are two and a seven are four.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.720]   So I'm going to have three cameras.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.520]   I have to have an over the head camera so I can do my cooking show and, or sewing show.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.600]   And then, yeah, I can do the whole thing from home.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   So it does work.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.720]   Do you need to do any special software or just put it right into the eight time?
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.240]   Uh, put it right into the eight, and the advantage of that is that the eight,
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.680]   M looks like a webcam, right, whatever you're going to stream out to.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.880]   So you plug it in and it comes in and it's there.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.640]   We'll end up buying a black magic.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.720]   Um, what are the little screen recorders?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.320]   So I can also record dusty.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   Yes.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.080]   You're getting the little mini mini hyper deck.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.280]   Well, wasn't the hyper deck was the cheaper, the cheaper one of those.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   I don't have.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.840]   Oh, oh, the, the, the camera assist.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.400]   So you got a little screen and it works.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   It works great.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.600]   I'm just, I'm just figuring I should set who knows what's the future holds.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.880]   So I should have the capability to do something at home.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.800]   I've, I've been on the notification list for that black magic deck for like,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.920]   since the pre end of times, uh, and now you can't even get the, you can get like basic
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.160]   USB three HDMI capture, uh, dongers, uh, anymore.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.520]   So that's, it's kind of, it's kind of, I hate to, I hate to compare it to toilet paper.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   I'm saying that.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.680]   Because it has a different use.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   Yes.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.280]   It's, it's, it's more like, uh, it's, those are both things that before the pre pandemic,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.560]   I was considering buying and experimenting with.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.960]   And now that I know that they're almost unobtainable as I, it's pretty much assured that as soon
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.680]   as I get a notification that either one of these is available, I'm just going to simply
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   go ahead and buy it.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.840]   Well, we're asked before I was before my thinking was, well, I'll, I'll think about it because
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.560]   geez, it's a hundred dollars and three hundred dollars.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.560]   That's a lot of money.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.640]   Yeah, it is a pro version for more now too.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.120]   The mini-pray.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.400]   And I think that for most people, what I would say is that I think that the mini is as good
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   as you need.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.120]   I think the pro is, uh, the pro does its own streaming, although I would probably use something
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   else for that.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.880]   So I'm not, I'm, I think the pro is cool.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.960]   Uh, it has the biggest difference is it streams, right?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.920]   It has built in stream.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.200]   It streams yet.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   Um, yeah.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.840]   Yeah, it's got, it's got, does it have local recording?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   I don't know if it does.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.600]   Yeah, I believe it's got, no, you have to hook up a deck.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.480]   You have to get one of the, you have to, but I have to admit ergonomically, I mean, there's
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.720]   definitely some other stuff to it that I can't think of right now because I don't have it
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   in front of me.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.120]   I have the mini, um, but the mini I find ergonomically has about the maximum number of buttons I
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.880]   want as an individual doing my own, my own thing.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.960]   Um, is that there's a lot of, there's a lot there.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.560]   Now, remember that the software still works with this and so do things like stream decks
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   and everything else.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.160]   So what's cool about it is it's just works like any other items, which are, which are
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.960]   so you can, you can be controlling it.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.000]   And you know, the big thing that we've talked about is, I mean, anytime I'm talking to someone
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.560]   that's wants to do business presentations over their, over Zoom or whatever, I'm like,
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.000]   this is almost a required piece of hardware at this point.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.560]   You know, being able to switch back and forth between your documents and switch between,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.760]   exactly what you're doing.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.800]   I want to show a bunch of different angles.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.560]   Uh, and you don't have to think about whether the software supports it or what laptop, or
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   what, what ingest you're using or whether it's a PC or Mac, it just plugs in and just
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.760]   does the thing, you know?
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.040]   And so, but as Andy said, it is trickling.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.040]   We have some friends that own me that sell this stuff, you know, that, or that are in
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.480]   the group that I've been doing all these Zooms with in the mornings.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.640]   And they said, I don't think it like 10 a week, you know, like they're, they're, they're
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   riding a finally, you know, they're like a month, they're slowly, but they're basically
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.360]   making as many as they can as they, they're selling as many as they can make.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   And it's, I do, I love the, I was surprised it was so inexpensive.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   That's one of the things that really got me interest because that got me thinking that
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.000]   this is a device that's designed for someone like me as opposed to someone like you, or
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.720]   even you, actually, I can say you, you or you, because I can't, I want to start making
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.440]   videos partly for creative reasons, partly because, you know, I took, it took me 20
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.280]   years to pivot to terrestrial radio, maybe it's time for me to pivot to actual video
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.440]   at this point.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.080]   But I don't have, I'm not Renee.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.440]   I don't have like that kind of patience of like, okay, I've done a whole bunch of shooting.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.040]   Now let's sit and do a whole bunch of editing.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.800]   I really would much rather have like people see me press a button to switch from one camera
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   to another.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:09.760]   It really does seem to reduce it to a very, very, very guttural instinctive sort of thing
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.920]   we can just play with it.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.720]   And I'm just, I'm, that's why it's like, I think I got 300, I think I got 300 bucks
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720]   for this.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   I got 300 bucks for that.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.440]   So, I think it's like the Crane Cam 3000, the future of podcast.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   Crane Cam 3000.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.440]   Yes.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   Yes.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   Yes.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   Absolutely.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   No, it definitely is.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.000]   Actually, actually though, if I sold Alex, you also like to tickle the, I had the exact
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.320]   same experience as you where I fortunately, I bought this, the Logitech Brio like about
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.680]   a month or two before, like I think it brought in January or February.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.320]   No, actually, I'm sorry, late last year, I just had trouble setting it up.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:52.120]   But I also have like the nine to the Logitech 920 like standing by here.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:57.520]   I have two more in boxes in the closet because the case, because the case every time they
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.640]   went down to like 40 bucks on like a gold box deal, I would buy another one because the
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.960]   worst thing that happened is exactly your, your camera goes south and basically you,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.840]   you might be able to delay someone five minutes to set someone up.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.920]   But I'm thinking, gee, if I, if I become one of those bastards I complain about on podcasts,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.520]   I could probably fund like the, the, the pro version of that little deck.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   Ooh.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   Well, and, and right now I would say that I'll trade it for flower.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   I'll trade it for flower.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   10 about that.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.120]   I mean, trade anybody right now.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   I 20.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.720]   You, you, right now is the best time to stream live stream ever.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.600]   I mean, there's so many people at home looking for something to do.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.440]   I'm streaming right now three hours a day in the morning from six a.m.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   Wow.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   Office hours.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   So I do my, I have this thing called office hours.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:50.040]   And we do it on zoom and I open the doors at six a.m. and by six, 15 there's 45 people
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.680]   or 50 people by seven o'clock.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.080]   There's 150 people there and we just talk about media production.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.360]   So we just, we sit around people ask that you line up your questions before seven.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.720]   Then from seven to eight, we just answer questions and there's a, you know, there's
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.200]   a hundred and 50 to 200 people there and we're talking through, talking through questions
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.560]   and answering them and it's really built up to a thing, you know, and, and then there's
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:18.480]   a, and then from eight to nine, we have kind of a focused conversation.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.640]   So today we had elemental actually sent their product managers in to talk to the group.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.680]   So we were talking about their new, I don't know if you've seen the new little elemental
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.000]   link, but it's kind of the new, uh, all of that does what the little, the big elemental
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.320]   did.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.680]   It does what, what you would need it for.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.240]   Like this would be, you know, like a stream, stream of that.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   How much is it though?
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   A thousand bucks.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   Oh.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.560]   That's a lot less than the 25.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.040]   That's the big boy.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:49.760]   So this, this connects directly to, uh, this connects directly to, uh, AWS.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   So yeah.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Amazon owns elemental now.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   That's why.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.960]   But, but the key here is that because it's server, it's a server defined encoder, they
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.760]   can do a lot more between the two boxes.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.840]   So there's no, you don't need to know anything about this encoder.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   You can plug it in.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.960]   You go to AWS and say, here's, I got the stuff coming out.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.760]   I want to push it this direction and you're off to the races.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   And there's smart.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   And everything.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   They're smart.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.600]   And it's easy to, it's easy to put it into the cloud.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.560]   So it's super stable.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.040]   And, and so, uh, and it's the, it's the most, this is the elemental that I've been waiting
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   for.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.080]   You know, like this is after buying 25 of them.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:29.280]   Um, this is, uh, this little, this little box is the, um, what we asked for for years
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.520]   is that I have no one has to know anything about it on the ground.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   You plug it in.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   You put a video into it.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.400]   Uh, uh, ethernet into it and it works.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.360]   Anyway, so, so we, uh, this is going, is shipping sometime in the next, in the near future.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.960]   I have a couple test units that I've been working with and they brought their folks in.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.040]   So our group just got to grill them.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.160]   So it's, it's, I was like, you don't really get to do a presentation.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.760]   We call it the pit because you just get there at eight o'clock and there's, there's 150
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   people that just start.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.440]   Well, what's funny is, is you watch the, you watch people and, and they say, well, we'll
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.240]   send some PR people, not an elemental, but someone else said, well, we'll send some
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   PR girls like, yeah, they're not going to survive.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   They're not going to survive.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.760]   We need product managers, like we need product managers and engineers and, uh, and it starts,
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560]   it'll, you know, and we've already been there.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.000]   Most of them have already been there for two hours.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.160]   And so they're already moving at a hundred percent, a hundred miles an hour.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.920]   And when they, someone will start doing a presentation and immediately within three minutes, it's
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.160]   all us just asking questions and talking through it.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.720]   And so tomorrow we're doing audio over IP.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.640]   So it's all, you know, Dante and Rivena and AES and, and we've got like, these hundred
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.040]   people, are they pros working in the field or?
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.920]   It's a, it's a wide mixture.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.440]   Uh, it is, um, we've got, uh, pros that are working, definitely working in the field and
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.560]   all different fields.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.320]   So we've got guys that work on film, uh, people that work on, um, in audio, people who work
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.040]   in live streaming, um, and definitely is a leaning towards live streaming because of
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.320]   my background, but, but also a lot of effects because of my background.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.400]   And so, um, so there's, uh, there's about 900 people who have joined the group and then
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   there's plenty given day.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.720]   There's 150 to 200 people that show up.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   And, um, and we built, we, of course, what everyone wanted to do is I was like, even
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.440]   though three hours is every day is something, uh, we built a discord because they wanted
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   to talk more.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.640]   So now there's a discord with a couple hundred people that are all, that are all, um, you
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.000]   know, churning through ideas and, and, and filling in.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.680]   And so the conversation between the two of them are starting to bounce.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.040]   And again, it was just one of those things like I, I knew for the first time in, I don't
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.400]   know, a decade where I was going to be for every morning.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.400]   Right.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.240]   And so, so after a couple of weeks, I was like, I'm just going to turn this on.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.800]   And so we've been doing it for about a month and it's, it's been, uh, and then on, on
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   Saturday, we do, uh, this Saturday will do eight hours straight, which is, um, so we
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   do like three hours.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.400]   People just need a running in the background, basically.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.600]   No, not really.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.280]   I mean, there, I mean, I think some people do, I think some people do, but there's at
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.360]   least 50 of them that are just talking, you know, and, and, and interacting.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.000]   So because they're, because we're actually, the big thing is, is that we're actually,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.240]   the whole thing is a conversation.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   There's no presentation.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.880]   So when people come up, people are just bringing up comments and questions and, and, and stack.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.720]   And, you know, so the on, you know, folks that aren't on video and the webinar platform
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.280]   and inside of Zoom, you can kind of separate them out.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.440]   They're asking questions inside of the Q and A boxes and chatting amongst themselves in
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.280]   the chat, like kind of like the IRC chat that you'd have here.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.400]   So there's, it's a really kind of, uh, thunderous effect, you know, of all these people sitting
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.600]   there talking about it.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.560]   And, uh, um, and we're just trying to.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   How do you get into this?
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Is there an address?
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.120]   Uh, there is.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   I'll put it.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.640]   It's, it's a, you, it's a zoom.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.640]   You know, I have zoom zoom.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   What are you using?
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   Oh, I'm, we're using zoom.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   You use zoom though.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   I think it's a sturking.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   Well, I, it's, it's a, it's the easiest thing like, will you get mocked if you have a bad
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.120]   zoom background turned on?
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   No, really the zoom back.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.720]   It's like the, it's like the clip on time.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.160]   No one will say anything, but we will all say, Oh, that was a choice.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.160]   No, no, it's not.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   It's not.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   There's, there's outright ridicule.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.840]   Um, you know, so the, uh, well, the big thing is, is that, is that we, uh, you don't have
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   to come in.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.320]   So the way the webinar works in zoom, you don't have to raise your hand.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.200]   So if you raise your hand and say, I want to come in to the panelist area where I'm going
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.000]   to show my video, you're saying I have good on internet.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I've got good audio.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.040]   I've got good video and you have to do that early.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.440]   If you like, we, we broadcast seven, if someone goes to YouTube slash Alex Lindsay, you'll
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.080]   see the, you'll see the seven to eight hours.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.160]   So even though there's three hours, we only broadcast one hour a weekdays.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.320]   Um, so you can kind of see what it looks like.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.080]   Um, but, uh, this is not a, this is not a revenue generating business for you.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.640]   You just like to do.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.280]   Well, it's been really useful for me because as I'm doing tests, as I'm talking through
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.400]   stuff, uh, it's, it's really great for me to just sit there and you'll see that, and a
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.640]   lot of pretty good videos there.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.800]   I mean, a lot of video quality.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   You'd have to, right?
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.960]   This is, you don't show up for this unless you get something going here.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.920]   And there's, uh, and there are people are coming in from all over the world.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.160]   So Australia and India and Israel and, uh, and so cool to pass.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.200]   And, and so you can, I could just sit and be a bump on a log.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   You totally can.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.960]   And you don't have to have any, they would see you.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.880]   No, I know a few of these names actually, I know Victor very well and a few of these
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.440]   names, but that's pretty cool.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.520]   And I, you know, I'm not going to get into who, who is who, but there's a lot of who's
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.920]   who in the group.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   So it's definitely names.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.760]   - Yeah.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.560]   - Like I learn as much from the group as I give into it
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.740]   at this point, you know, like I'll ask a question
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.560]   and someone will have that answer in seconds, you know.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.500]   Chris Summers there, I mean, he works on feature films,
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.340]   you know, and so--
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.900]   - And he's in Budapest right now.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.220]   And for some reason, he's using a NASA Mylar blanket
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.680]   as his backdrop.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.560]   - Yeah.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   - Okay, whatever makes you happy.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.780]   - Yeah, so the, so anyway,
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:51.780]   so it's an incredible, you know, again,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.100]   I couldn't do it on any other platform other than Zoom.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.420]   I mean, to have this kind of open--
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.900]   - How many people would be in there?
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.740]   - 100, 150.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.700]   - There's 150, 200 every morning.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.460]   And then there's, again, there's the group of people
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.300]   who have registered--
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.620]   - And it's partly 'cause all these people are not working.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.100]   I mean, nobody's, all the production--
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:08.940]   - Yeah, we don't know what'll happen.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.940]   - We don't know what'll happen.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.180]   - I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.580]   And if you go to the thing on YouTube,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.420]   you'll see the link there.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.180]   There's a link in the description of how to register for it.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.420]   - Okay.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.380]   - And so you can get to it from the YouTube.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.660]   And I posted it, I posted every once in a while.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.420]   I don't wanna spam people on Twitter,
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.540]   but I posted every once in a while.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.540]   I'll post it after the show.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.420]   So people are following me on Twitter.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.060]   I'll post it one more time so people can see it.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.580]   But the, I don't know,
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.020]   it's kind of the one of the coolest things I've worked on.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.260]   - I think it's so interesting.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.820]   - I think it would agree.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.660]   - It was a lab.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.660]   I was like, I wonder if anyone will show up.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.740]   And then there were 50 people,
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.860]   and then there was 70, and then there was 150,
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.700]   and then there was, you know,
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.380]   there was a couple of days where we went over 200,
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.860]   and I was like, I don't, you know,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.740]   and people seem to be really, you know, they really enjoy it.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.620]   And we go everything from technology and education,
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.700]   to live streaming, to film production, to audio,
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.700]   to, you know, all these different, you know,
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.780]   we bounce around.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.940]   We have, on Saturdays, we have Steve Bays,
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.580]   who, he was a product manager for Final Cut.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.180]   And he comes in and does tips.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.020]   (laughing)
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.820]   So, so, yeah.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.660]   - Wow.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.140]   - So Steve comes in and, and then they're like,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.540]   it's like the highlight of the day is Steve Bays
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.100]   sitting there showing you tips and tricks of things
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.780]   about Final Cut that you didn't know existed,
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.940]   and everyone's always like, holy smokes.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.700]   And then, remember Oliver Bridenbach, who you,
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.500]   you know? - Oh, yeah, Oliver Oliver, yeah.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.820]   - So Oliver gave the group, yeah.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.380]   Oliver gave the group 90 day versions of Memo Live,
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.460]   and then Oliver comes in at 11 on Saturday,
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.580]   and answers everybody's questions.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.980]   - So why are Oliver going to do that?
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.820]   - Yeah.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.660]   - Oh, it's killer.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.340]   And the thing is, is that, so we're really talking
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.540]   to someone who can answer the questions.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.140]   So when we, when we have, you know,
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.580]   all these people showing their projects
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.740]   and trying to figure it out together,
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.780]   and everything else.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.900]   And it's, you know, it's a, it's kind of grown
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.340]   into this kind of amazing community that,
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.460]   and we had, you know, John Tautoules from Sound Devices
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.980]   came on and just talked about audio
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.220]   and talked about field recording.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.900]   And, and, you know, we've had, you know, a lot of these,
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.060]   you know, Brian Maddox is one of my, you know,
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:02.980]   one of my engineers.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.380]   And so we have these incredible people doing these second,
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.420]   second hour talks.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.340]   And I, you know, and I'm just having fun doing it.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.660]   I mean, it's outside of my work day,
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.980]   'cause it's early in the morning.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.100]   That's why it's early in the morning,
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.740]   is so that I can keep on doing what I do for a living.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.580]   And, but it's kind of my little hobby.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.100]   And it's kind of, again, one of the cooler things
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.220]   I've ever, ever worked on kind of happened by accident.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.220]   - And can I say how cool it is that every morning,
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.180]   like I wake up and I see like what's been posted on YouTube
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.940]   and I'm subscribed to like a lot of like,
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.220]   again, for years, like network stuff.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.820]   It is always so hysterically funny to me
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.940]   when I see like the YouTube of, of your chat,
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.060]   you've got like, and the poster frame is like you,
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.980]   you're looking like as fabulous as you usually do here.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.940]   And then, but in my YouTube grid, it's like NBC News.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.340]   That guy doesn't look as good as Alex.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.820]   And oh, and here's a late night talk show.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.980]   He doesn't look like as good as Alex on this.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.820]   - You should hire zero.media and get some pros in there
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.300]   working with you, Ellen.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.780]   - The funny thing is, is that I would say right now,
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.140]   I'm probably the, my rig here that's set up
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.420]   is probably the fourth or fifth best rig in that group.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.140]   Like it's, I'm not, I would not consider myself number one.
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.740]   - No, number one. - There's some guys.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.740]   - Who has the best?
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.060]   You know, let me think.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:24.940]   - It's okay, it's okay.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.780]   You probably don't like James.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.620]   - I would say James Cameron is it?
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.540]   Is it James Cameron?
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.380]   - Yeah, James Cameron.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.220]   - James Cameron.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.060]   - James Cameron is great.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.740]   - He's bringing it's incredible.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.580]   It's a, we don't know.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.860]   - I really read rig up doing 12K, it's ridiculous.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.980]   - To be fair, he is at 60 fathoms.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.060]   So there is some, in the past year,
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.900]   you have to make some announcements.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.580]   - Yeah, so, but it's an amazing group.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.660]   I would highly recommend people check it out at least.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.500]   - Yeah.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.860]   - Watch it on YouTube and if you like it,
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.180]   then come join us.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.540]   - Can you just record the Zoom?
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.300]   You just press the record button on Zoom?
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.140]   Or do you just--
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   - I hit stream.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.980]   - Ah.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.820]   - So we're streaming the air for--
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.260]   - In the air for-- - In the air for live.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.860]   - Yeah, so what we do is, is from six to seven,
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.180]   it's really open conversation.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.220]   I mean, we talk about all kinds of things between six and seven.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.620]   There's at, to be in the video part,
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.860]   you have to be there by 640 because we do micshex.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.620]   So we literally go through every person
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.740]   to make sure that they sound okay.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.180]   And then we talk and then at seven o'clock,
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.740]   we start broadcasting at eight o'clock,
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.340]   we close the broadcast, then we go into our kind of more
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.900]   in depth discussions about whatever the subject is
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.020]   for that day.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.820]   And so, so we only stream one out of the three hours
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.140]   that's up there, but you can get a sample
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.540]   of what it looks like.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.380]   It's much different.
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.020]   I have to admit, I don't understand why people
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.300]   would watch it on YouTube as much.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.660]   I mean, there's people who do,
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.860]   but it's such a different feel when you're in it.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.700]   It's better to be there a lot.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:39.540]   It's better to be there a lot.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.220]   Well, you're in the chat,
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.380]   your people are doing questions
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.220]   and there's something about being in the room
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.220]   that being in the virtual room that feels so different
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.540]   than what you see on the stream.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.700]   But it's good content either way,
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.380]   but it's why I haven't really published it
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.740]   is 'cause I feel like it's just kind of a,
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.620]   you have to kind of be there to understand.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.020]   Are the island people jerks and use the Ironman HUD
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.100]   for all of their videos?
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.340]   (laughing)
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.660]   At least start selling t-shirts, man.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.580]   Act like a member of the 21st century monetize it,
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.020]   monetize it.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.860]   When I find--
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:13.820]   I'm trying to figure out what I can do,
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.100]   how far I can go without having to monetize it.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:16.940]   That's just kind of the game.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.780]   I just do it.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.860]   How big can I go and how far can I go?
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.020]   Two for three, yeah.
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.620]   What I find fascinating is how in unusual circumstances,
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.140]   and we're all in very unusual circumstances right now.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   Right.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.900]   Human creativity is just amazing.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.140]   And the things that emerge that are native,
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.180]   and this is why I look at things like Quibi and Go,
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.580]   that's not native.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.540]   You need something that's native
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.580]   that emerges from the circumstances.
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.980]   This is a perfect example.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.260]   And it just happens 'cause it's the right time,
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.140]   the right place, the right everything.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:45.980]   And--
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.820]   By Quibi thinking about like,
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.060]   "Oh, I should have started this a year ago or two years ago."
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.460]   Couldn't have realized it would have never happened.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.140]   It would have been like this weird thing
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.340]   that 30 people showed up for.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.900]   And the reason it's at this moment that we can do it.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.220]   And again, I don't know what's gonna happen
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.460]   after quarantine ends, but it's a moment.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.060]   I'm gonna keep doing it until it--
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.900]   It's good not to get too attached to any outcome
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.460]   because then you're not,
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.980]   the problem is when you get attached to an outcome,
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.180]   you're not fluid enough to test.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.180]   It's so Buddhist, Leo.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.020]   Yes.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.020]   You've got a lot of the horse in the direction it's going.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.620]   Well, and every day, I have no idea, like we started up,
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.780]   but we have no idea what we're gonna talk about.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.980]   It's like whatever someone brings a subject to the,
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.020]   there's literally no, except for the second hour,
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.300]   the first two hours, there's literally no plan,
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.060]   other than we're just gonna start talking
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:29.380]   and we'll probably not run out of some of that.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.740]   I'm gonna, seven days a week?
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.660]   Seven days a week.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.220]   And then, yeah, we go,
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.060]   the discussion's two hours on Saturday and Sunday,
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.100]   but we don't broadcast it.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.860]   So it's one hour of kind of setting up
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.780]   and then two hours of discussion on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.980]   And then Saturday keeps going.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.940]   It goes nine, 10, 11, 12.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.220]   And is the Zoom?
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.020]   The Zoom is the same every time,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.020]   'cause there's a link--
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:48.860]   It is right now.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.900]   The YouTube, if you go to youtube.com/allics.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.980]   Yeah, so what we've done so far is kept it all,
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.060]   kept it all in the same link,
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:57.940]   that way people can just click on it and it works,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.980]   and it works every day.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.460]   And it's pretty locked down.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.900]   We've gotten pretty good at,
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.340]   I can't say that it's always gonna be that way,
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.980]   but so far it's--
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.820]   No, it's been a long way.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.380]   We did, at the beginning, we had some,
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.940]   that's why that's pretty locked down now.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.820]   You know, it's, it's, it's, it,
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.020]   we had some things that you'll never unsee.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:19.860]   Oh, it's--
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.500]   Louise, Louise, people are so awful.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.340]   So we learned.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.420]   Yeah, yep, yep.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.860]   That's how you do it.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.700]   Yup.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.420]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.260]   That's really cool.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.100]   Thank you.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:30.940]   Thank you for letting me talk about it.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.780]   I'm glad, so glad.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.620]   You're very excited about it.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.820]   I can't wait tomorrow morning.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.060]   Six a.m.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:35.900]   Jesus.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.740]   It's another indication that the best things,
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.780]   it doesn't matter the century,
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.620]   it doesn't matter the situation.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.820]   The best things happen because somebody thinks,
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.900]   "Hey, this is a good idea," and nobody stops them.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.580]   Doesn't it, you don't start with a business plan,
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.700]   you don't start with a--
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.540]   That's true.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.380]   Is there a market for this?
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.820]   Alex has, as I was saying goes,
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.020]   he has a peculiar set of skills.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.580]   He has an interest in it,
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.980]   and he can't help, but his enthusiasm,
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.100]   it can't help but equal his experience in this,
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.940]   and that's what makes it so viewable.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.540]   I've never participated,
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.260]   I've watched you on YouTube,
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.620]   and it has almost become like,
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.660]   as I'm making my morning tea
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.380]   before I even get out of my bed,
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.420]   this is, I've never made it through the entire thing
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.780]   because it is very, very long,
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.220]   but it's just very, very fun to see,
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.860]   like, see you for one thing,
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.100]   but also to see, like, everybody talking so enthusiastically
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.980]   and at a high level and with very, very low level of bozo-dom.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:29.980]   It is really cool.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   Wow.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   And I've been really fortunate that that culture
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.180]   has just kind of built up around it
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:37.140]   where there's people who know a lot more than I do
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.540]   about their given subjects,
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.780]   and fortunately I was just fortunate enough
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:43.300]   to attract enough people that would do that,
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.940]   where I knew enough to at least to get them to show up,
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.820]   but now, you know, there's so many times
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.140]   where I throw the question out to the group
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.620]   because I don't know the answer.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:56.460]   And so it's, and the group itself is getting a lot smarter,
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:59.460]   you know, and more cohesive every day.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   So it, and I think...
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.460]   I hope we have it rooted by talking about it.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]   I just...
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460]   I will see.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   I will find out tomorrow, right?
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.460]   That the hordes...
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.460]   Well, I might show up now, Leo's out there.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.460]   Yeah, I know I am.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   Sorry, Alex.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.460]   No, no, talk it.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.460]   No, I was at Alex's last stream with there only 500 people.
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.460]   It's the burning man of the 2020s.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   We're going to take a break.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.460]   We come back.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.460]   Apple had a quarterly report.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.460]   We can talk about their earnings.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.460]   For what it's worth, we can also talk about other things,
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.460]   but first a word from our sponsor, World Wide Technology
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460]   and AppDynamics.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.460]   Together, they deliver the application experience,
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.460]   your customers, demands today.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.460]   We talk a lot about worldwide technology.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.460]   We talk about their Advanced Technology Center.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460]   Lisa and I went out there.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.460]   We saw it in March.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.460]   We were so blown away.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.460]   And then they said, "Oh, and you know, we do some other things."
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   And they showed us a few other things.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.460]   And they said, "We can do apps for people.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.460]   They showed us some of their apps."
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   And I went, "Why are you not talking about this?"
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.460]   I've gone through hell and back trying to get an app for TWIT.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.460]   WWT can transform your business with a great app,
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.460]   great software, is the ability to change lives,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.460]   to change businesses, to change the world.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.460]   And WWT is driven as a custom application design and development
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.460]   company.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.460]   They do that too.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.460]   It starts with a conversation.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.460]   They help you identify your specific business needs.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460]   They do it right.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.460]   They're an agile house.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.460]   They have a very, very good process with AppDynamics.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.460]   Once you kind of talk about your needs,
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:36.460]   they'll talk with you about how you can approach the challenges
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.460]   and unique and new ways, and then they can create software
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.460]   solutions that will make an impact.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.460]   This is a company that listens.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.460]   That's so important when you're getting app development.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.460]   They focus on the specifications,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.460]   the exact specifications you want and you need.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.460]   Their team provides resources and platforms to make it possible.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.460]   They've been doing this for two decades.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.460]   For instance, WWT, I won't name names,
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.460]   but they worked with a healthcare organization
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.460]   to connect medical teams from the care center to patients at home.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.460]   So it was a custom software app.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.460]   Within a year, they saw amazing results,
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.460]   50% reduction in preventable readmissions.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.460]   They called this engagement at home,
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   50% reduction in preventable readmissions,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.460]   35% fewer days spent in the hospital because of virtual care,
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:27.460]   60% fewer septic shock deaths
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.460]   occurring in patients being treated remotely.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.460]   This really worked.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.460]   They've worked with rental car companies.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.460]   They produced a mobile app that provided improved customer rental experience.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.460]   Customers can make reservations, perform check-ins and returns without waiting in line.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.460]   They worked with a grocery retailer.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.460]   By the way, a grocery retailer that I bet is very happy they have this app now
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.460]   through ideation, innovation and creative work.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.460]   They improved the customer experience and the grocery retailer hit their two
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.460]   and three year goals in less than a year.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.460]   And I bet they're looking back and saying,
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.460]   "Wow, thank goodness we had the foresight to go to WWT and get that app."
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:03.460]   They do agile software development from planning to ideation to delivery.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   That means you get the best quality at the lowest cost in the fastest time.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.460]   They use DevOps to drive business outcomes
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.460]   by evaluating, designing, implementing and operating with tools
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.460]   to enhance your operational efficiency.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.460]   So it's not just apps.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.460]   They use container platforms.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   They state-of-the-art stuff, rapidly creating services that can scale and perform.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   By designing, architecting and implementing cloud native apps in an agile fashion.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.460]   WWT. I love these guys.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.460]   I want you to know about these guys.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.460]   Some of the smartest people I've ever met, such a well-run company.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460]   Transform your business today.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.460]   Find out what you can get done with WWT.

[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.460]   It's kind of amazing.

[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:28.460]   Actually, before we get to the earnings, WWDC is online only and it starts June 22nd.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.460]   Actually, this is good because more people can attend it.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   This has been the problem with these developer conferences for Google, Apple, Facebook, everybody.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   They're at Microsoft too.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.460]   They're limited when they're in a physical location.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.460]   Everybody can't attend.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.460]   Anybody with a developer account can virtually attend.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.460]   The only thing that people might be complaining about is that the only people who are getting
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:59.460]   those cool developer jackets are going to be kids who win a programming contest.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.460]   Maybe they're trying to be like...
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:07.460]   I wonder if you're going to see adult programmers like this Pinewood Derby.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.460]   I'm going to build you an app son or her daughter.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.460]   I want you to enter it and tell them you need an adult size extra large.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.460]   You're a beefy kid.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:22.460]   Every year we have people visit the studio during June who are wearing this year's WWDC jacket.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   I know there are people who have every one of them.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   Yeah, it's going to break their heart.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.460]   This year is going to be a little gap in their WDC.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:38.460]   It'll be interesting for a lot of these conferences to see what they do when they can bring it back.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   I don't know when that's going to be.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.460]   I don't even know if it's going to be next year that we see all these conferences come back.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.460]   I wonder if some companies might say, "Hey, this works so well.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.460]   Let's never bring it back."
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   There's definitely selective.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.460]   Yeah, I think that what we're going to see is a reduce in the rate.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.460]   Probably not for a company like Apple because they don't do that many already.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:03.460]   But if you look at a large Fortune 5 company might do 15,000 events a year somewhere in the world,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   I think that we're going to see that number drop dramatically.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:16.460]   One of the things I think we're going to start seeing is that we're already seeing rumbles of is folks that are interested in climate issues.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.460]   Now that we have some solutions that are starting to get used, people are starting to point out that,
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.460]   "Oh, by the way, what is the carbon footprint of these conferences?"
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   Now that we started doing without it, do we really need to have everybody fly in?
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.460]   Do we really need to have all that lift to get out the same thing?
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:41.460]   I think that you're thinking about that globally for a whole bunch of things.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:42.460]   We start looking at the cities.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   You look at these cities.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.460]   Life is so much better now.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.460]   It's quiet.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.460]   The air is clean.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.460]   The animals and plants are coming back to you.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.460]   You can post apocalyptic movies.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.460]   It's wonderful.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.460]   Coyotes and Times Square.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   Most of the companies are finding that they're statistically not for each person.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   They're definitely exceptions.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:06.460]   Statistically, they're seeing increases in productivity across these companies.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.460]   A lot of these companies are quietly pinging their employees going,
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.460]   "Hey, so when this all ends, do you want to come back?"
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   Do you want to do this or do you want to work at a house?
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.460]   The employees, a lot of them are saying, "No, we don't want to come back."
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.460]   Then they say, "Where would you live?"
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   The vast majority of people I've seen in surveys say, "Yeah, we like working for home.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.460]   Let's keep doing this."
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.460]   You don't have to live in Cupertino.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.460]   You can live anywhere.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.460]   They're asking, "Where would you live?"
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:36.460]   The South Bay is not at the top of the list.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:41.460]   I think that the real estate in some of these cities could get pretty rough pretty quickly.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:47.460]   When they shift, people are, "Right now, we're still struggling, but we're figuring it out."
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.460]   There's going to be some point where it gets figured out.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]   Then we start to...
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:58.460]   Lake Cabin up in Oregon, Cuspe area, 16 acres.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.460]   It's got a fishing dock.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.460]   If I'm streaming, I can stream anywhere these days, right?
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:06.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.460]   Go ahead.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:14.460]   I was just going to say, my worry is that we'll go through a phase where for a year after this becomes a manageable thing,
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:20.460]   it will be this paradise of people who want to work from home, can work from home if their job allows them to.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:25.460]   Then we're going to have two or three years after that when the companies have forgotten why we started doing that.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.460]   First, because it was a medical survival necessity.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460]   Next, because it made their workers happy.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:38.460]   Now they're going to be thinking, "Maybe we could transfer a bit percentage of these people from salary to contract workers."
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.460]   We wouldn't have to pay benefits to them.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:46.460]   I think the hard part is that the hard part for a lot of that process is for a company like...
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   They do already do that to some degree.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:55.460]   Even though they're already working in the company, there are a lot of them are contractors that are there.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:01.460]   That's a very complicated thing because, for instance, I would have been considered a contractor for many of those companies.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:08.460]   Even though I had my own company and we came in, we were the red badges, the gray badges, the yellow badges, or the green badges.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.460]   That are there in various companies.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.460]   I didn't want to work for them. I didn't want to work for any one of them.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.460]   I was fine working for all of them.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   I think that the contractor thing is already where they want it to be.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:32.460]   You hire employees because they are integral to what you're doing.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   You don't want them to just wander off.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.460]   You don't want them to be working for three other companies.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   You don't want them to do all those other things.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.460]   You want them to be yours.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.460]   You put them on salary.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.460]   I think that there's that.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.460]   I think from the moving away process, there's a lot of companies.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   I was talking to someone who owns a company in San Francisco that said, "Our lease is coming up and we are not going to...
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:10:02.460]   We're going to save $10 million a year by downsizing dramatically.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:07.460]   There'll be 10% of their workforce will stay in the downtown office.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.460]   The rest of them, they think that they're going to be able to let them disperse for what they do.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:19.460]   Remember all those video companies that had those huge office buildings and massive rents and they just couldn't pay the bills anymore?
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   It was a lot of the smaller scrap unit ones that had a bunch of remote employees that kept going.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460]   A lot of that made sense.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   Without technologies like meat and zoom and all these other things, getting to a point where we had video, where we had all this connection without the bandwidth.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.460]   I do think that one thing we really need to start thinking about is whether fiber to the home should be considered a utility.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   To really make sure that this is available to everyone because right now it's only available to folks that have good bandwidth.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:56.460]   I think the 5G can do whatever it's going to do but I think that we really should be considering fiber as a basic utility that all Americans have.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:03.460]   A one-gip connection is something that we should be... It would change their economy overnight to make sure that that was available.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:12.460]   Once we get an FCC that is actually interested in doing that as opposed to interested in picking whatever studies they can get to pretend that they're making that mandate.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:19.460]   But another thing that you bring it up, it's interesting that the cable companies and broadband companies were saying,
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:26.460]   "Oh, well, we have to have data caps and we have to have limits on data speeds because our poor little network can't possibly sustain it."
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:32.460]   But now that they switch that off for the duration of the crisis, gosh, you seem to be doing okay, guys.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:47.460]   They're doing okay. They're not doing great. We just want to be clear that you're seeing caps in Europe especially where the infrastructure simply can't handle it.
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:57.460]   We do see a lot more, from a live stream perspective, we're seeing a lot more what we call internet storms that are going through that are just cascading failures
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:01.460]   where suddenly everything goes red for a couple hours.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:08.460]   What I would say is that they are up against the outer limits of the capacity of the system, which is not where they want to be.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:17.460]   It's expensive for them to be there. But they can do it. I don't know if they could do it indefinitely at the price that they're charging.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   Okay.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   Well, and it's different in Europe than it is here in the US.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:31.460]   I haven't seen that in California, for instance. Comcast has terabyte caps, which are lifted.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:36.460]   I know people are a lot more online. I don't see any degradation in the performance at all.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   We're seeing it across. We're studying it a lot because of our shows.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:50.460]   I'm not saying that we're losing connectivity. I'm seeing that we're seeing system-wide issues occurring a lot more frequently than we did before
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.460]   because it's really on the, I believe, on the outer edge of what, and it depends on the network.
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.460]   I think Comcast has a much better network.
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.460]   Here in the Bay Area, they have a fiber ring. They have so much capacity. They don't know what to do with it.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:11.460]   Yeah, but I think that the issue is that we see other internet providers that are not, don't have that infrastructure and are really coming apart at the seams.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   So it's not all equal. I think Comcast is a lot further ahead than most of the other providers.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   They went further ahead with bandwidth caps as well. Isn't that interesting?
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   Right. The only thing that saves me is web precision, which is the... I have a fiber... I'm not a fiber.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:35.460]   I have a microwave out. I'm on top of my house that goes into Nevada. That's the only reason I... because otherwise I'd be out of band.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.460]   You're kind of in a rural area.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.460]   You're right. We don't really know what's going on inside those network operation centers.
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.460]   Everything seems to be okay. So it could be that they're struggling.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.460]   We don't know. Can we say goodbye to the butterfly?
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   You had a piece or another verge had a piece saying the saga of Apple's bad butterfly MacBook keyboards is finally over.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:04.460]   Do you think Renee that from now on all MacBooks will feature these nicer keys?
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.460]   Yeah, I mean, until they decide to change them again in 10 years.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.460]   Yeah, I wouldn't keep improving them though. I mean, if they do, like, generations,
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:21.460]   I would love for everyone to be super happy. Like, right now, it feels like the people who really love the stability of the butterfly keys are okay with these
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.460]   and the people who like the old scissor keys that click the clackiness is not quite there yet either.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:33.460]   But the level of love... And I would like... If Andy would just like, festoon this with adoration and whoever liked the butterfly keyboard would like,
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:40.460]   yeah, this is great for like, if they could just iterate second gen third gen so that 80% of people are really happy with it.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.460]   I would say, you know, chef's kiss. There you go.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:48.460]   Yeah. Yeah. I think if it's the same keyboard as when I tried on the larger MacBook Pro, it's adequate.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.460]   And that is... For me, that's better.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.460]   It's better, but not perfect.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:57.460]   Exactly. My difficulty and I won't go into the whole thing again because we've all heard it,
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:03.460]   but it was a keyboard that I absolutely couldn't use versus a keyboard that I can simply accept.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:10.460]   I don't... I like the ThinkPad keyboard so much that for a limited time,
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:14.460]   they actually put that keyboard into like a Bluetooth and a USB.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.460]   And I happily bought multiple copies of it because it's such a great keyboard.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.460]   But I don't have a right to expect my favorite keyboard and a machine that has to make everybody happy.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:29.460]   But the problem as I think Rene said it that it should not be... This should not be a divisive issue.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.460]   You should have a keyboard that everybody thinks is at least an okay keyboard.
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   And finally, we're back to that. Like I said, I didn't... It would have been nice if somebody on that team had to run a gauntlet
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   and a paintball in a paintball court without armor.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:52.460]   Again, not... But just to sort of make a cult but the fact that they switched,
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   just as we've seen, Apple never admitted that the iPhone 4 had faulty antenna.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:03.460]   They simply had another revision of it that I don't know, it didn't have that problem anymore.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:07.460]   So that's all we're asking for. We're asking for results and at least we got it.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.460]   I have to say that this is finally one of my biggest war reasons now off my head right now.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:18.460]   I do feel as though if at the end of this year I felt like a MacBook Pro was...
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:22.460]   I still needed a premium laptop and that a MacBook was going to be my best choice.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:29.460]   I would now have no issues buying this one. Whereas before it would be okay, sorry, Lenovo, you're up.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:39.460]   Well, and as an example, the Magic Keyboard for the iPad is really quite usable compared to the smart keyboard
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:44.460]   cover that Apple used to sell. It's roughly the same, right? It's on the MacBook Pros.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.460]   And I feel like that's transformative. Jean-Louis Gessain, his Monday note,
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:57.460]   said finally I can use my iPad without suffering as a full-time computing device.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:02.460]   Well, again, when I'm not doing video production, I prefer my iPad.
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.460]   I mean, I take my iPad out frequently by itself.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460]   Take it all up by itself.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.460]   Do you have the... I feel like I need to have a laptop?
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.460]   Do you have the new keyboard? Do you have the trackpad and everything or no?
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.460]   I don't have it yet, but I'm going to...
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:17.460]   Because I'll tell you what, it's not just the keys which are nice.
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.460]   It's that trackpad really transforms the way you work with the iPad.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:25.460]   And I think it's... I find myself more and more for instance writing on my iPad,
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.460]   whereas in the past, I really didn't want to do that.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   And I've written most of my... Even on the last iPad Pro, I've written most of the articles that I've written
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:36.460]   in the last six months on it. Because I actually like... I liked it.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.460]   I like to be able to take it to a coffee shop or take it outside.
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:43.460]   That's the sad thing. You put this new keyboard on there and it weighs more than a MacBook Air.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:47.460]   But... But... It's still portable.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:54.460]   And I guess I would say the one thing that's so different is the fact that you can draw on it for me,
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:55.460]   that I can switch modes.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:00.460]   Yeah, you're a visual person and you're an artist, so yeah, for you having a pencil on some device.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.460]   Well, even when I'm just trying to think out thoughts and it's not necessarily artistic,
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.460]   it's just like a sketch. I'll be working in pages and I'll just draw something out.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.460]   I'm going to put something here. I know that I want to have a picture here and then I keep on typing.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:19.460]   Or I sketch stuff out. It's not that it's artistic in the sense that no one's ever going to see it other than me,
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:26.460]   but it allows me to very quickly annotate what I'm working on, which I just find an incredible combination between the two.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:35.460]   And what I always wanted from the MacBook, and now that the iPad is reaching to the point where it's almost as good for content generation,
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:41.460]   maybe not in the video in the 3D that I'm doing, although my plan is to get the iPad with the LiDAR soon.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.460]   So I will be able to play with that.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:49.460]   It's time to go to sixcolors.com, Jason Snell.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:56.460]   And look at the graphs once again because Apple has come out with another quarterly report.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   Top-level analysis, Renee Ritchie.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:05.460]   This was a quarter that was up only 1% year over year, but up is up.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:13.460]   Yeah, I think given everything that's happening, almost any company could have been forgiven for a really, really bad quarter.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:19.460]   And I think that Apple, they were down in some areas, some important areas, but they were up in other areas significantly,
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.460]   like services, a little bit in wearables.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:27.460]   I think this is the version of a blowout quarter for the way the world is right now.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:34.460]   His company still made billions and billions and billions of dollars in water, probably the harshest conditions,
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.460]   aside from maybe next quarter.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.460]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.460]   There's really only, it was January, February, March, so there's really only a month of COVID in there.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   At most, it's going to be very different.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:50.460]   So the first month they thought it was going to be an exceptional quarter, and then it hit China,
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.460]   and then they thought it would be a hard quarter, and then it hit the world, and I thought it would be a disastrous quarter.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.460]   So it ramps down significantly through that quarter.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.460]   But still, they managed to pull it out, I think is.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:06.460]   I think what Tim Cook has done, I think he's underrated as a CEO, as weird as that is to say,
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:11.460]   but last year when the problems in China hit, and he had managed to diversify Apple's business,
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:16.460]   including wearables and including services, to the point where even when the iPhone, for the first time,
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:19.460]   dip below half of earnings, Apple was fine.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:23.460]   It wasn't as great, and people were super angry about the iPhone, but Apple as a business was solid,
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.460]   and that's only grown.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   So when you look at wearables and Apple watch and airpods and those things now,
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.460]   they're becoming increasingly stable even when the iPhone fluctuates.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.460]   I think that's all key to how he's been managing that business.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:43.460]   Yeah, if you look at the services revenue, 13.3 billion, very steady climb over a couple of years,
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:49.460]   I wouldn't be surprised next quarter if there weren't a big jump in services, because we're all home.
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.460]   We're presumably using Apple services more than ever.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.460]   Maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:01.460]   Seventy percent revenue growth in Apple services duplicating last quarter.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:08.460]   Wearables, you know, this we should point out, this is Q2, so as you can see, there is a pattern
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.460]   with the spikes in Q1, and then the drop in Q2.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:17.460]   This is all very predictable because of Apple's seasonal selling when there's a new phone,
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.460]   they make a lot of money.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.460]   Profit $11.2 billion.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:26.460]   Year over year, that's 1% growth, that's good.
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:31.460]   Actually, more than that, it's 10% growth, it was 10 billion.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.460]   Actually, 11.6 billion Q2 2019.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:41.460]   So a little bit of a drop in profit, but not anything to worry about.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.460]   It's really going to be the next quarter that people are going to kind of wonder about, right?
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:54.460]   Yeah, I think most of Apple included most of the calls this week focused a lot on here is
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   our long-term strategy and why decisions that we made last year have been paying off for us.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.460]   In Apple's case, here's why we've been moving to services, and here's how well our wearables
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.460]   market has been going, because that's been making up a lot of the money that's been lost
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.460]   in the past month for other types of sales.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:17.460]   But everybody, it's odd for a guidance-oriented call to so specifically say,
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:22.460]   "We will have no guidance for you for the rest of the year because things are changing so rapidly."
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:25.460]   It's got to be very relaxing.
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.460]   What they're doing is they're getting used to the fact that we're not going to give you any guidance,
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.460]   and then at the end of the year, they're going to be like, "Yeah, we're not going to do that anymore."
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:33.460]   We're done with that.
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:37.460]   Alex is going to do these Zoom calls every morning, and we're not giving you any more guidance.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.460]   It's a new world.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:45.460]   I would like to point out that Disney stock keeps on going down as we relate to Apple
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.460]   needing to solve other problems.
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.460]   Why would it?
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.460]   Who left the Apple with the bike?
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:55.460]   Apple would bike Disney and make Alex the impression.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:23:01.460]   No, I'm saying you put Alex in charge of the integration, and then I think everybody wants to talk about it.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   Apple's a good.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:08.460]   But yeah, when you think about it, you don't have anywhere for people to go visit and go to the rides.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.460]   Oh, right, and they can't go to see movies, and there's no strikes.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.460]   Parks have got to be dying.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.460]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.460]   It's all of it.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:16.460]   It's all on Disney Plus.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   The whole burden for the company is Disney Plus.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.460]   There's definitely...
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.460]   I'm from maybe maybe Yoda making revenue, but...
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.460]   I forgot about that.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.460]   Yeah, there's very much of an in-person amazement company.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:37.460]   If Apple continues to do okay, and Disney does not, it creates a market opportunity for Apple.
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.460]   Apple's never going to back Disney.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.460]   If Apple buys Disney, they will own 95% of my childhood.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.460]   Like the limit of the amount of stuff that I love that Disney owns is almost uncomfortable at this point.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.460]   Except for Star Trek and DC Comics.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.460]   They'll never get Babylon 5.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.460]   This is true.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.460]   No, Strazinski might sell cheap.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.460]   Don't say that handy.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:02.460]   No, no, because Warner Brothers would rather let it die than actually give it to anybody else.
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.460]   But yeah, no, it is incredible that...
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:09.460]   Nobody at Disney could have...
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.460]   Everybody has to be forgiven because...
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.460]   What if I don't know?
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:17.460]   There's no movie theaters open so we can't open any of our movies we've already paid for.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.460]   And we can't open any of our theme parks.
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:20.460]   The whole summer.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.460]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:31.460]   The next quarter earnings call is going to be most interesting because I think that there's going to be a bunch of forgiveness for everybody.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:42.460]   Particularly because I think anybody who is managing these portfolios who has announced a sense were making moves already in anticipation of what's going to be affected very, very badly.
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:50.460]   But now we're going to be talking about long-term health of these companies that, okay, yes, Disney, you were caught on a wear unprepared by this.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.460]   But now you've had three or four months to make some moves.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:57.460]   Including stuff that's less interesting than operating theme parks.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.460]   The actual financial moves that keep your company healthy.
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:08.460]   What are you doing to make sure that as the planet starts slowly opens up again, you will be in a position to actually continue to thrive and survive?
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:12.460]   Well, the hard reality of that is what most companies will do is lay people off.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:16.460]   Yeah, I mean, that's your number one cost typically.
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.460]   It's also weird that AMC is banning Universal, but not Disney.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:23.460]   Like, you know, the Disney Universal is the exact same thing and AMC is super cranky in public.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.460]   It's because about Universal and not going to Disney.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:29.460]   It's because Disney didn't do a press release talking about how good their movie went.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.460]   I mean, that's what it is.
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.460]   I mean, Universal did, you know, they want to show what they're trying to do.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:38.460]   Universal is trying to talk to their stockholders and saying, "Hey, we have something that's actually working.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:41.460]   We're not completely in the tank."
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.460]   And then the theaters, of course, are terrified.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.460]   This is possibly the end of theaters as we know it.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   You know, like, this is, like, I don't think people realize, like, how terrified they are right now.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.460]   So they're terrified.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:56.460]   And they know that if movies move to day and date, it's over.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.460]   Like, it is like, you know, so what Universal did is the most terrifying thing that all,
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:08.460]   you know, that's what keeps everybody up who owns a theater is the idea that these guys will come out of this whole dilemma saying,
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:11.460]   "Well, we have to have day and date because we figured out how to make money with it."
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.460]   And so that is, that's why they reacted so swiftly.
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.460]   It's to shut everybody else up.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.460]   Like, you can release those movies anytime you want.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.460]   You just can't talk about it.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.460]   And it's a silly.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.460]   It's silly because we're moving to day and date.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   I mean, and the number of screens we have is way more than we need.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:34.460]   And, you know, what we need is about 3,000 or 4,000 really nice screens that only do, you know, event films.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:42.460]   And this is an opportunity for a lot of old habits that are probably destined to peter out anyway to go away.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:49.460]   I think it was just last week the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences finally relented and said that you no longer have to do that.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:57.460]   You no longer have to open a movie in an actual physical movie theater in Los Angeles in order for it to qualify for the Oscars.
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:01.460]   Now, Apple can premiere a movie on streaming.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.460]   Netflix, all these other services can premiere movies on streaming and they will still qualify.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:17.460]   All they have to do now is make that movie available for the private Academy-only streaming service that's used just basically to screen movies for consideration.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:26.460]   And even that might be an interesting change because remember, Spielberg himself was opposed to Netflix being able to get movies considered because,
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:30.460]   oh, this is a, this was just, I know they opened in a theater, but this was a streaming movie.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:43.460]   One of the arguments that they were making is that they can't, a movie that was designed for theaters to, for, and have like a six-month window of exclusivity before hitting big, big, big poor being available to home video.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:49.460]   It has a natural, it has a natural disadvantage because people will see it if it's on Netflix.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.460]   We're asked people will not see, well, maybe not get around to seeing it if it's, if they have to go to a theater to see it.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:11.460]   So we might see, people were joking earlier about how the Harley Quinn movie, the Birds of Prey movie, oh, well, if the only movies that are, that will be entitled to Oscar consideration are the ones that opened before March,
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:14.460]   Harley Quinn might be the best picture nominee this time.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:26.460]   But we might have, but the great thing is that if we are leveling, if we're creating a field where the medium through which most of the voters are seeing these movies is the medium through which most people see movies,
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:32.460]   we might stop seeing, oh, here's a historical drama set 30 years ago in Hollywood.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:33.460]   That's now the hot contender.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:41.460]   No, maybe the Avengers movie or the Star Wars movie that everybody actually saw and loved has a better chance than before.
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.460]   So it's, but Alex is right.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:54.460]   The idea of people getting out of the habit of going to the movie theater to do stuff is a super dangerous and probably not reversible of effect that this could have.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:08.460]   One, and again, I was at it before, I mean, I don't think it's worth it unless it's going to be near perfect video and audio, which is the only thing that I consider worth it as iMacs and the Dolby cinemas and really just always cinemas at this point.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.460]   And so what about the V with booze and snacks Alex?
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.460]   Does that entice you?
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.460]   Oh, I hate that.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.460]   He brings this up.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:19.460]   No, the thing is, it's so hard to be like Lindsay gets the movie theater.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.460]   And I usually withdraw people who won't turn off their phones.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.460]   That's worse.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.460]   No, it's so easy.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.460]   If I want booze and snacks, I stay home.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.460]   I have a, you know, you have a nice system and you just stay home and watch it.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:37.460]   If you want to watch a movie and experience it, I go without, I still get popcorn, but we usually finish the popcorn by the end of the previews.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:41.460]   And so, and, but I think that we have way more theaters.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.460]   The bottom line is we have way more screens, not more theaters, but way more screens than we need today.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.460]   The kind of movie that succeeds no longer needs a small screen.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:56.460]   So those little screens that you have that they play on the second, you know, three weeks or four weeks or six weeks of a film.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:07.460]   Those screens just get rid of all and have one or two great, great screens that are maybe turning faster, you know, so that aren't changing every week, every two weeks, every three weeks.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.460]   Like if you look at the cinema one in, in, in San Rafael.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.460]   It only has one screen.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:13.460]   Incredible.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:23.460]   Now it's hard because the problem it has is that with the contracts that they have currently, what, what theater owners need to do is move towards being able to turn faster.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:28.460]   So one of the things that happens is when they sign a contract that says, I'm going to take Star Wars, they have to keep it there for x number of weeks.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.460]   You know, that's part of the deal, right?
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:37.460]   And, and so, and they, the way that they get charged for is the movie studios get the lion's share of the money.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.460]   If you pay 12 bucks, I think the movie studio gets like $9 or something out of it for the first couple.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.460]   That's why popcorn is so important.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:51.460]   It's for it to the theaters is because, because they don't make any money for the first couple weeks of a film, because all that money goes back to the studios to pay it off.
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:31:01.460]   Now with this day and date happening, you know, the big negotiations going to go on back and forth is, you know, the theaters might carry it, but they're going to want more money up front.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.460]   And then they want to turn that faster.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:09.460]   The reason they hang those, they hang on to those movies for a while, so they don't make any money for the first two or three weeks and then they make money on the, on that tail end.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:18.460]   They make a lot more money. And so, what they need to do is be able to make sure that they're making money on the first three weeks or the first two weeks, and then they turn it every two weeks, you know, instead of keeping it there.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:23.460]   And that's an entirely different math, but that's when you're seeing AMC doing what it's doing.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:27.460]   You see Universal doing what you're doing. You have to remember that this is a, there's a big chess game going on.
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:32.460]   This isn't like guys being, you know, they're all, they're all negotiating for a better rate.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:40.460]   So, you know, there, you know, there, this isn't as emotional as it may look. Everyone's trying to, trying to get something out of it.
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:46.460]   And so there's, it's a, it's an interesting puzzle that'll be more interesting over the next 18 months.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:50.460]   Tim Cook must have a very good staff writer, speech writer.
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:59.460]   Like Daddy writes his own speeches, but if he does, Tim kudos to you. He gave the commencement address at the Ohio State University.
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:04.460]   I thought it was really moving. If you get a chance to watch it, it's up on YouTube.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:10.460]   The first line, it can be difficult to see the whole picture when you're still inside the frame.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:17.460]   But I hope you wear these uncommon circumstances as a badge of honor. I really, I really like everything he said.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   He said, fate comes like a thief in the night. The loneliness I felt when we lost Steve was proof that there is nothing more eternal or more powerful
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:37.460]   than the impact we have on others. Those of us who can look back on this time and remember inconveniences and even board them can count themselves lucky.
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:42.460]   Many more will know real hardship and fear others still will be cut to the bone.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:50.460]   And while we turn to our loved ones and friends for comfort, think hard about those whose impact on your life is more distant, but no less meaningful.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:59.460]   It's really a beautiful speech from Tim Cook in his Ohio State polo shirt, not wearing cap and gown, but recommended.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:03.460]   Isn't there a rumor that Aaron Sorkin tried to help Steve Jobs with his famous Stanford address?
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.460]   Steve just wrote over everything.
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:10.460]   Yeah, but Steve's Stanford address also iconic and never to be forgotten.
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:14.460]   And I think this might be also one of those. I'm really impressed.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:20.460]   A lot of celebrities have been doing virtual commencement addresses and stuff, but I'm very impressed with it. Tim.
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.460]   Yeah, I wish you could be all kind of.
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:25.460]   He loves like Kennedy and Martin Luther King and a lot of the real classic.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:32.460]   He'll be a Airheart T.S. Eliot Franklin Roosevelt. Yeah, he brought it all in there. It's a really well done speech.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:43.460]   And it really is a great opportunity for those of us who watch these companies because if it's not 100% written by the marketing department, and this certainly does not sound as though it was even partially written by the marketing department.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:52.460]   It's an unusual opportunity for a CEO to express what his broad thoughts, his or her broad thoughts are.
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.460]   Yes, yes.
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:34:00.460]   And even outside of a keynote, outside of a marketing, outside of a results call.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:07.460]   Yes, obviously it's a keynote to graduates. So there are parameters that you need to stay inside unless you're late night comedian.
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:24.460]   But it's sort of like here is in a broad sense what I would like to say to my own kids, particularly like earlier generations where here's what I'd like to say to my kids, but I'm a man and I'm not allowed to speak of my emotions to even to my children.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.460]   So yeah, this is something to be observed very, very closely.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.460]   Yeah, I think he's a deep fellow.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.460]   I think we've known that for a long time, but this absolutely confirms it.
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:42.460]   He also is very patient. Apparently spent 11 hours teaching Warren Buffett. How do you use an iPhone? Oh, no, no, hours, not 11 hours.
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:45.460]   It's an apple care support call.
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.460]   Okay, Warren.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:56.460]   I love the fact in the end, they pointed out that Warren Buffett didn't bring his iPhone to the interview for that because he said it might ring and I don't know what to do with it.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:01.460]   I still use it like I said, I quite understand the process. So it's hysterical.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:19.460]   It's nice because there's so many CEOs who are like just utterly destroying themselves on social media, not just the big ones that we know of, but just so many of them that are showing an absolute lack of compassion and insight and consideration and caring, or just the wisdom to have a communications team sit between them and an open microphone.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:31.460]   And then you have people like Tim Cook and even like Bill Gates is retired, but there are others that show you that these people can put humanity before their own ego for short periods of time.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:37.460]   You get that feeling about Tim. He seems like a very humane and deep person.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:43.460]   Let's wrap this thing up with your picks of the week speaking of deep and humane.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:47.460]   Renee Richie, what's your pick this week?
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:59.460]   So I didn't have my link ready, but there's a new, this is weird little game out from impending. Phil Ryu does a lot of really good, really famous games behind the scenes, but he made a little app called Hello Kitty for his daughter.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.460]   We've been playing with it. We played with it on iOS today. It's hysterical.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:10.460]   Oh, I missed it. Yeah. So yeah, he just coded it together. He was you talking about your kitty? Yeah, here kitty. Sorry.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.460]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   I don't want to get him in trouble with the Hello Kitty copyright.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:19.460]   No, no, no. So the idea is, and it's for kids, but you know what? I'm going to do. Don't tell Lisa, but I'm going to spoof her.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:28.460]   So the idea is you put this on your phone, you give it microphone and the speaker access, and then you hide it somewhere, face down.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:34.460]   And then when you say, when when somebody goes, Kitty, here Kitty, hit me.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:43.460]   Yeah, but it's meowing somewhere private. Kitty. Oh, I lifted it and it just said, you found me in nine seconds. I have to put it down again.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:48.460]   It's just a small, subtle. It's the bestest game ever. Yeah. Yeah. You're kidding.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:55.460]   I kind of want to have the goose go after it and see if the goose and the kitty can become friends. Kitty, Kitty.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.460]   You're kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:01.460]   Where are you? Kitty, where'd you go?
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:14.460]   And if you don't know Phil, he's been the graphics power behind really famous apps like Camera Plus and some famous talk show hosts hold on their head and all sorts of really top shelf, top quality, top grossing apps.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:20.460]   So when he does something just for fun, it's like when cables, as soon as something for fun, you know, it's just it's a work of craft.
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.460]   It's perfectly good. It's like the beautiful list.
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:39.460]   I would love to see an AR version of this, particularly when we have been, but we're like the person who hides it will actually just like drop an AR kitty, sleeping, napping, napping very peacefully and comfortably like behind the sofa.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:49.460]   And then you with your AR version, the app have to like not only like listen for the meows, but also like look, look with the AR with the AR portal to try to find the kitty.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.460]   I'm surprised by how much I was interested I was in this app because it's really cute.
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:58.460]   Like it is it is like a perfect little object.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.460]   It is perfect free.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:12.460]   I don't know if you saw it, but Matthew Panzerino retweeted this link of a person who made an AR kit app where you scan a plant with your iPhone, put it over in front of your Mac and the plant transfers over to the document you're working on on your Mac.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:20.460]   And then you scan something else and the picture of that thing goes into the stuff they're doing with the AR kit now is just so imaginative and amazing.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:24.460]   But this didn't need a our kit because it's going to be under your sofa.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:29.460]   So yes, you just have to hope your kid gives you the phone back after the way they have a new toy.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:37.460]   Or that they find it before the battery runs out and you forget yourself forget where you put the phone and now you're kind of stuffed.
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:39.460]   It's really he must have a little kid, right?
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.460]   Yes, he did it with his daughter.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:46.460]   Here he is with his little daughter.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.460]   Oh, that's a divorce.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:53.460]   Let me let me let me fix the sound so it's coming out of the right speaker here.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.460]   It's got to come to the HDMI.
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.460]   Now you can hear it.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.460]   So listen carefully for me.
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.460]   I was just.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.460]   She's.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.460]   Oh, that's so cute.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:11.460]   Oh, you found kitty.
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:14.460]   That is so cute.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:22.460]   Something to do with your kids.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.460]   It's such a great idea.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.460]   Just to make you smile.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.460]   Just to make you smile.
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.460]   Isn't that sweet?
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.460]   Again, again, again.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:30.460]   Again, daddy, again.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.460]   That's when you know you got a hit when they say again.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:36.460]   That's five stars in the app store.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:37.460]   Immediately.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:42.460]   Mr. Andy, you're pick of the week, sir.
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:45.460]   I've got a pick that I've really been enjoying for the past few weeks.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:57.460]   I'm going to preface it by saying mental mental health thing just because you're isolating does not mean that you are required to learn a new skill or get a project done or anything like that.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.460]   You're only required to help yourself and the people that you're around.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:03.460]   That's it.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:08.460]   I happened to get really bored a couple weeks ago and checked out blender once again.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:20.460]   Blender is a free open source 3D rendering system that the last time I checked it was way too hard for my poor little pink brain and it wasn't very, very well documented or supported with tutorials.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:26.460]   But the version that I installed a couple weeks ago, it's still it's not a for fun Z's sort of app.
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:30.460]   It's for people can do real professional up.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:35.460]   Excuse me, Alex can correct me if I'm wrong, but can do what looks like really good professional work with it.
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:44.460]   But if you want to start learning how to get on how difficult would be to model this room or Gee, I wonder how difficult would be to just make a donut and then and then all of that.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.460]   Exactly.
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:53.460]   And and the their tutorials now online that are really that my favorite one by a channel called Blender Guru.
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:57.460]   That is actually their tutorial like I'm going to teach you how to make a donut.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:09.460]   And the first one we're going to make is going to be like a very, very stupid looking just going to be basically like a tire, but we're going to learn how to put how to give it color in background and put and put frosting and put sprinkles on it.
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:17.460]   And then you start to go nuts and start thinking about Gee, I would actually kind of like to like build a version of I like to build this room.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:27.460]   I'd like to build this spaceship. I would like to. I'm starting to think about Gee, I kind of what this I took this kind of okay photo of a landscape last year.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:34.460]   And the lighting was great and the colors were great. It really needs a death star right there in that corner right there to really set it off.
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:42.460]   And it is now at the point where if you if you have some time to learn how it works, you can actually have fun with it and play with it.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:58.460]   And it is one of those creatively enabling tools, things that whether you want to do animation, whether you want to do still images, whether you want to doctor up photos where you have fewer limitations now and what you want to do versus what it takes for you to actually do it.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:07.460]   There's a learning curve, but I found myself failing in interesting enough ways that encourage me to keep working.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:22.460]   Like I said, it's free. Just download it and download it and give it give it a try. If you if you can't get through the donut tutorial, you all you lost was three, four hours, which means you got three, three, four hours more of more of a techno episodes of Colombo to get through from your binge watch.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:30.460]   I think it's an incredible value. I mean, they've come a long way too. They it was one of those things that 10 years ago, it was pretty hard.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:47.460]   Yeah, just blender. And and now, especially in their partnerships with real time, you know, some real time platforms and so on and so forth, they are have really accelerated the ability because people just want some version of something that they can they can build assets and and publish those assets.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:56.460]   And so a lot of the tools have gotten a lot better incredibly quickly. And so so I think that blender is a great place to do exactly what Andy was talking about.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:05.460]   I mean, I, you know, I use him before D because it's really pushed towards broadcast, you know, and graphics and those types of things and and I've used it for a long time.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:19.460]   But but I think that, but blender is an incredible value for, I can't believe what they're giving away at this point. So if you don't definitely want to get explore 3D and to start, you know, figuring out whether it's something you might be interested in.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:29.460]   And it has a lot of scale. You can do a lot of complex things. And I know a lot of folks that are using Maya, but if they want to show someone how to do something, they're going to use blender because they know that person can download it.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:37.460]   I mean, that's the other advantage. If you're working with other people, you may have that Maya or cinema 4D or something else like that, but they might not.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:46.460]   And so being able to coordinate with lots of people all over the world that may not have those assets, being able to open it up and actually work with it for free is a great value.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:44:04.460]   So I would highly, I would highly second to Andy's recommendation. That's great. We were talking about playing with kids. Well, the my closing, my closing convince is going to be there are lots and lots and lots and lots of tutorials on how to turn a stick in a kid's hand into a lightsaber.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:08.460]   Now, now, now just do it. Now go to it.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:11.460]   Alex, Lindsey, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:20.460]   So we have an alum, someone in our alumni that has an update. And so I want to make sure that we recommend it or talk about it a little bit.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:30.460]   Emory Wells are, you know, in episode number one of Macbreak, Emory Wells was one of the hosts and his company is Frame.io.
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:40.460]   And he is just hitting, that company is hitting at all cylinders. So this is Frame.io, what they released today and they released just a couple hours ago.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:46.460]   It's Frame.io transfer. So this is something that lets you actually transfer your files whole file structures.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:52.460]   Before it was just kind of like put up an image and we'll review it and you can have a series of those. But now you can put up whole folders.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:58.460]   It doesn't get that far away from being able to, you know, not far away from Dropbox at that point, we'll just say.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:04.460]   So, you know, so you're really being able to store a lot more of your footage up there and interact with folks.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:12.460]   They're now allowing for people who do what I do, you get worried about people sharing the content. So now when people look at the content, you can have a watermark on it.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:22.460]   And so that's going, that helps a lot as far as security. You're always worried about passing that footage around and making sure that people don't share it.
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:29.460]   And you, turns out you put their name on it, they share it a lot less if it's burned into every frame. You know, it takes all the fun out of it.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:39.460]   And so invite only access for enterprise, which helps a lot. You can now download stuff onto your phone and, you know, work on it on the plane and put it back up after effects integration.
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:48.460]   So these are all the things that came out today. And it is the app that everybody I know is, that is doing review, review processes.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:57.460]   If you're working in post, this isn't a live app, this is a post app. If you're working in post and you want reviews from your partners, from your clients, I did it with my parents.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:06.460]   I was working on a project for my dad and I just threw the videos up. And if my parents can figure out how to log in and start adding notes to it, I think the UI is pretty well developed.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:17.460]   They're not the most, my mom just moved away from a flip phone to a screen like three months ago. And so while she was still stuck on the flip phones, she was already using Frame.io.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:24.460]   So this is just an incredible app. And the big thing is as a Mac user, it just feels like someone who's really paying attention.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:29.460]   I mean, Emery definitely pays attention to just how it feels and how it works.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:35.460]   Obviously it's got great functionality, but it also feels really good. It's really intuitive, easy to use.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:42.460]   And every once in a while, I just want to remind people it's out there because, again, within my industry now, it's become the standard for post.
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:51.460]   That's how everybody is getting reviews back and forth between each other. And the integration with Premiere and Final Cut, now After Effects, and Avited Seamless.
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:56.460]   It's nice because you can download not only original content, but low quality proxy content.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:04.460]   So if you have limited bandwidth, but you want to see the video, you can do it without eating up a lot of bandwidth.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.460]   It's very focused on the task at hand. I like that.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:10.460]   Oh, absolutely. You can draw on it. And the great thing is you're in Final Cut.
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:12.460]   You say, "Just export it up and it just pushes the whole thing."
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:15.460]   You don't have to figure out how I'm going to render it out and how I'm going to stick it in.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:19.460]   It'll just push it all out there for you. And then integrate the notes back in.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.460]   It's totally tied into the apps.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:24.460]   So they have their own cloud. It's stored on their cloud. Is that right?
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:27.460]   Yeah. I mean, I don't know where their cloud is.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:30.460]   It's free. What does it cost?
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:38.460]   It costs, I believe it's $14 a month for maybe one person to use or something like that.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:44.460]   It's not...or $19 a month. You get a seat, which means that you can put stuff up and people can look at it.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:49.460]   But you can kind of work on it solo. And then you start making teams at about 50 bucks a month.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:53.460]   So it's across a little bit. You do have to be professional to want to use it.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:58.460]   That's right. But I mean, for the price, it's amazing.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:01.460]   Yeah. You know that you can do this. So it really helps a lot.
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.460]   Frame.io on the web.
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.460]   It's so good. Oh, you use it too?
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.460]   I don't use it as much because I don't edit with a team yet.
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:15.460]   But whenever people like when I do collabs with the YouTubers, more often than not, now I get frame.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.460]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.460]   Yeah. They work so easily.
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.460]   That's what you want. You want to get all the YouTubers.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.460]   I mean, this is really the standard. It's become something that everybody's using for this kind of work.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.460]   Oh, that's great.
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:28.460]   Well, good for everyone. That's fantastic.
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:33.460]   And it's not some big company that made it something everybody's using. It's just really well done.
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.460]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:36.460]   That's exactly what you need to do.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:42.460]   I will be a little self-serving and just remind people that we have a new short show.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.460]   We're doing a bunch of hands-on shows.
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:48.460]   And if you're a Mac break weekly watcher, you might want to watch hands-on Mac.
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:49.460]   It's so much fun.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.460]   Oh, you're very kind. I wouldn't expect it.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.460]   No, it is so much fun.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.460]   You're knowledge to do.
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:56.460]   But this week we did Spotlight.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:02.460]   And so I was actually, it's fun for me to do because I learned all sorts of extra stuff that I never had any idea.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.460]   The things you could do with Spot.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:06.460]   It's like watching the lab with Leo and the old shows again. I love it.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:07.460]   Thank you.
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:11.460]   And we are going to be doing starting next week.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.460]   It's going to be a little bit interesting.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:16.460]   We're going to do Homebrew and then do Broof files.
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.460]   So we're going to get a little hardcore in the command line.
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.460]   So go to twitter.tv/hom for Hands-on Mac.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:27.460]   And don't you love Anthony Nielsen made some great album.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.460]   It's so nice.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.460]   It feels so retro and lovely and vintage.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.460]   Hands-on Mac.
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.460]   That's perfect.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:35.460]   Thank you for letting me plug it a little bit.
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.460]   It's brand new.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:41.460]   We only have seven episodes out, but we have a couple more coming in the can and more all the time.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460]   Supa!
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.460]   Supa!
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:47.460]   There is some last minute news and that is the new AirPods Pro firmware is out.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:50.460]   So if you were trashed by the previous one and tried to roll back.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:51.460]   I don't know.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.460]   I don't worry yet on how well it works, but the new version is out.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.460]   Would you do it via the iPhone, right?
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.460]   You have it on the iPhone and then you copy it over.
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:02.460]   Some people had active noise cancelling problems after the last firmware.
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   It was fine, but a lot of people were really ticked off by it.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.460]   So hopefully this fixes it for them.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460]   Interesting.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.460]   We did.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.460]   I haven't updated my AirPods Pro.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.460]   So I guess I dodged a bullet there.
[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.460]   Wait, wait for the early enough.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:22.460]   Renee Richie's new video channel is youtube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:25.460]   Must watch, subscribe, ring the bell so you get notifications.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:31.460]   The only thing I'm doing that with, by the way, is Renee Richie's fabulous show at Renee
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.460]   Richie on the Twitter.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.460]   Great to have you, Renee.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:38.460]   Is it still freezing in Montreal or has it started to dry up?
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:40.460]   It's not this morning, but it was really hot the day before.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.460]   So I think it's trying to confuse us.
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.460]   Maybe it's trying to put out those cell power flyers.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.460]   Maybe that's what they're doing.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.460]   I don't know.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.460]   We'll see.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.460]   All right.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460]   We'll stay warm or something.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.460]   We're going to have 87 degrees on Friday, so we're getting hotter and hotter.
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:56.460]   Which is not good because that's when the fires begin.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:51:00.460]   Andy Enaco, you can hear him in WGBH Boston Thursday?
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:03.460]   Friday, probably 1130.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.460]   When the mayor decides to break in, it's usually at noon.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.460]   So we've moved up to 1130.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.460]   Does the Boston mayor sound like Mayor Quimley on the Simpsons?
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:20.460]   If you're not going to be Kevin White, then you're not going to be anybody's behind.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:26.460]   When I was growing up, you had Mayor Kevin White, who else, you always talk about the great
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:31.460]   Shadia Boston, and like, oh, that's a bad list, okay?
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:34.460]   He should sound like Mayor Quimby.
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:38.460]   If he doesn't, he just missing the boat because he's got that great bass.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.460]   No, you want the, that's the posh Kennedy accent.
[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:45.460]   Who spends time in Europe?
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.460]   Again, you want Kevin White who's going to go down, fix that MBTA.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:54.460]   If you don't got a token, then don't jump the time style, okay?
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:57.460]   We keep those prices low for a reason.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.460]   Everybody support them.
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:00.460]   By the way, Andy, you were --
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.460]   Give me a scratch, take a narrow, dunk a donuts.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.460]   You were stellar on our Twitter after hours broadcast.
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:07.460]   Now on Fridays, we're doing all sorts of things.
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:14.460]   Last week, it was a perfect for you because it was a cooking competition with Aunt Pruitt,
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:20.460]   Michael Sargent, and Jason Howell, and you and Mary Jo Foley were our judges, our celebrity judges.
[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:25.460]   It was wild, especially when Anthony decided, "I'm going to take 10, 15 minutes out of the timer
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:28.460]   and see what they're doing here," which was pretty wild.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:35.460]   And he gave them very difficult ingredients, including snails, pickled cactus, dragon fruit,
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:38.460]   and the Alton Brown would be a great beef.
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.460]   I'm just going to say that.
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:40.460]   And dried beef.
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:47.460]   No, I was -- again, I decided I almost buzzed my hair and made a bow tie to be more Alton Brownish.
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:52.460]   But then I decided, "Let's go more chopped," because I tried -- I tried started to hand so a bow tie,
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:57.460]   and I realized that I could either spend the next three hours doing this or the next three hours reading up
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:59.460]   on the theme ingredients and knowing what I'm talking about.
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:00.460]   You were perfect.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.460]   It was so -- it was so much fun.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:03.460]   I'm -- because I'm such a fan of chopped.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.460]   I've been watching that show for like 20 years.
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:12.460]   And I was really surprised at how quickly just I was able to just channel that, "Okay, well, it looks like you're preparing your pan.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:15.460]   Is that pork fat or is that butter?"
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:17.460]   It was so good.
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.460]   It was so good.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.460]   It was fun.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.460]   It was fun.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.460]   Thank you so much for whoever thought to invite me, because I had so much fun.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:26.460]   You couldn't have been more suited to the job.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:28.460]   And it's on our events feed.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.460]   I think that's twit.tv/events.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.460]   I'm going to guess.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.460]   Let me see.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:34.460]   There it is.
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.460]   Twit after hours.
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.460]   And it's also on our YouTube.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.460]   We're going to do another one.
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:39.460]   There they go.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.460]   There's Jason and his girls.
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.460]   There's Micah.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.460]   There's Ant.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.460]   I won't tell you who won.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.460]   But it was definitely down to the wire.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.460]   It was wild.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.460]   Yes.
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:48.460]   Wild.
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:49.460]   And you dressed so nice.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.460]   I was glad.
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:58.460]   Again, I thought that if it was either going to be, I either have to be Alton Brown or have to be dressed like one of the judges on Japanese Iron Chef.
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:02.460]   I almost asked them, "Please introduce me as lower house member, Andy at our good."
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.460]   I'm glad we take it seriously.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.460]   And look, Micah's just adorable and everything.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:07.460]   Oh, it's so cute.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.460]   This was such a fun show.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:11.460]   And Ant was like, "Hurr, hurr, I'm going to win this one."
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:12.460]   And he did, maybe.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.460]   Everybody wanted to win.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.460]   Everybody took it seriously.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:15.460]   That was my only fear.
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:19.460]   I said, "Oh, look, I'm missing in Pop Tarts and cold cereals."
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.460]   No, no, people were serious.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.460]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:22.460]   No, it was like, "No, they wanted to win."
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.460]   I don't know.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:26.460]   I wonder if Micah's chihuahua is over-helping him under the counter.
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.460]   No, but Sebastian came in at the end to have a...
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:29.460]   Because you had to have a taste.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:35.460]   He was obviously Andy and Mary Jo couldn't taste it, so you had to have third party tasteers come in.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.460]   And I don't think, honestly, there's an uppolillo.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.460]   Sebastian really liked the escargot that much.
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.460]   He was kind of a no-one escargot.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:50.460]   This week, we'll be doing the match game with Dick D. Bartolo, who's famous for having saved the match game
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:52.460]   with his amazing questions.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:54.460]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:55:00.460]   4 p.m. Pacific on Friday, 7 p.m. Eastern for Twit after Hours.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:04.460]   This is another one of those things we'll probably keep doing after COVID because it's so much fun.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:05.460]   We just really love it.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:10.460]   And thank you to the team that's really putting an extra effort to make it interesting and fun.
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:16.460]   Are you telling the contestants to make sure you're good and buzzed a half hour before airing, just like in the real match game?
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.460]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:25.460]   Gene Rayburn, you know what Dick said, the problem was they would do 5 in a day, and so they do a couple and then have a lunch break.
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:29.460]   And it was always the second half that were a little bit different.
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:32.460]   You can always tell the ones that came later in the day.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.460]   After lunch.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:37.460]   Even as a little child in the 80s when it was on syndication every day,
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:42.460]   they'd be like, "Gee and Rayburn, well, Richard Dawson is a lot more funny now.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.460]   I don't know why."
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:44.460]   It's a lot more dirty.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.460]   And Dicty Bartolo was the guy who, match game was really boring with normal questions.
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:50.460]   They were about to cancel it.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.460]   Dickey Dee was invited.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.460]   He was writing for Mad Magazine at the time, and he was invited to come in and write some crazy questions.
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:02.460]   He was the one who came up with Dumb Dora and all of those and all the innuendo, and it saved the show.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.460]   And it gave it many, many, many more years of life.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:06.460]   So we should have a lot of fun on Thursday.
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:08.460]   That's going to be my match game on our...
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.460]   Sagan?
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.460]   Friday.
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:11.460]   Not Thursday.
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:12.460]   Match game after hours.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   No, no.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.460]   After hours, Twit.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:16.460]   With the match game.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:17.460]   I don't know.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.460]   Mark Goodson, Bill Toddman, production.
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.460]   And of course, Alex Lindsay.
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:28.460]   He's up at 6 freaking AM to do a Zoom call with everybody.
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:33.460]   If you need to hire the best team in the business, 090.media,
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:39.460]   follow him on Twitter, Alex, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y, and of course, youtube.com/AlexLindsay
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:41.460]   to find out more about the Zoom event.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:44.460]   There's a link there at the bottom or in the comments of the video.
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.460]   Anything else you want to plug, sir?
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.460]   Nope.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:48.460]   No.
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.460]   I'm just happy to be here.
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:50.460]   I miss you.
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.460]   I haven't been here for a while.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:52.460]   Yes, I know.
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:53.460]   We miss you.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:54.460]   It's good to know.
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:55.460]   Folks at home, tell me what you think.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:58.460]   Am I on a green screen or is Alex on a green screen?
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:56:59.460]   One of us is...
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.460]   Is Alex a green screen?
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.460]   Is Alex a green screen.
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:03.460]   One of us is on a green screen.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.460]   Ready?
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.460]   Ready?
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:07.460]   Oh!
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.460]   Such a good green screen.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:12.460]   I guess that's not Zoom you're using.
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:18.460]   You can tell the real pro because the amateurs will shave their heads
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:20.460]   so that they'll mat better on the green screen.
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.460]   That's right.
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:23.460]   It's the pros that keep their normal hands and heels.
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.460]   Alex shaves the real world.
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:28.460]   Well, the funny thing is that I'll say one little thing about it.
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:32.460]   This is why I think it kind of works is number one is that...
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.460]   That's your real studio.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:36.460]   Well, that background is actually my living room.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.460]   My wife has allowed me to put the...
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:41.460]   I know, allowed me to put the rack here.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.460]   That rack actually is in the living room because it makes too much noise in my studio.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.460]   In my office.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:46.460]   I can't have it there.
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.460]   So it's right around the corner.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.460]   So it's actually right there.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:50.460]   Right?
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:51.460]   But anyway, so shot with the...
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.460]   People are thinking about backgrounds.
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:57.460]   It's shot with the same camera, same height, same angle, same lens, same focus.
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:00.460]   So they're all the vanishing points and everything else works.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:09.460]   So that takes away some of the disbelief that you have with virtual cameras is getting the image to match up with the foreground.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.460]   And then...
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:13.460]   So that's a piece of it.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:20.460]   And then what I'm actually using for the key is a black magic constellation, which is a big switcher.
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:24.460]   But what's important is to know is that this little box here, this little...
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:25.460]   Let's do it.
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:27.460]   This has the same...
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:29.460]   This has the same key as the one that I'm using.
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.460]   So...
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:32.460]   Now we gotta get it.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.460]   What it does differently is that it is not a chroma keyer.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:38.460]   It is a linear keyer that is based on the Ultimat.
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.460]   So, you know, black magic bot Ultimat.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:41.460]   Wow.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.460]   And so they...
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.460]   Now the Ultimat 12 is amazing.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.460]   I mean, the best keyer I've ever seen live.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:53.460]   But they took a simplified version of it and put it into all the way down to this little mini.
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:58.460]   So this mini is like the best keyer right now for the price ever made.
[01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:01.460]   And so it happens to do switching as well.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:05.460]   So I'm talking about the black magic 810 mini, which is only 300 bucks.
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:07.460]   I'm gonna be using it in my home studio.
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:08.460]   Yeah, you gotta...
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.460]   Yeah, I was lucky I got it before COVID.
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:11.460]   Unobtanium.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:12.460]   Unobtanium.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.460]   But so I'm gonna...
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:14.460]   Basically, we're gonna do the same thing.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.460]   I'm gonna bring my cameras in, we'll shoot all the backgrounds.
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:20.460]   And then I'll just go home and you'll never know where I am from now on.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.460]   You're totally gonna make that work.
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:25.460]   Get that front camera there.
[01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:26.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:27.460]   You can do the whole thing.
[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.460]   Yeah, we'll talk.
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:29.460]   We'll talk.
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:30.460]   We'll figure it out.
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.460]   You know what I really need?
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:32.460]   I don't have a green screen.
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:33.460]   I need to get a green screen.
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:36.460]   And then I need lights 'cause you have to light the green screen completely flat.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:39.460]   Well, the funny thing is I'm actually not really lighting the screen very well.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:42.460]   If you look at it, it's...
[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:44.460]   It's got all kinds of shadows and everything else.
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:45.460]   It is uniform.
[01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:50.460]   The trick there is that it's a Lycra green screen made by a company called Composer Components.
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:54.460]   And the only ones I know that make these Lycra screens, you can stretch it, spray it with
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:56.460]   water and all the wrinkles go away.
[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.460]   I should've got it.
[01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:58.460]   I literally have...
[01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:01.460]   I bought piping at the hardware store to do it.
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:05.460]   So it's literally just not lead piping, but you know, just...
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.460]   It's stretched.
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.460]   Yeah.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:08.460]   And it's just stretched out against it.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:10.460]   It's like a 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]   And I just stretched it out.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.460]   How did you hold the fabric?
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:14.460]   You have clips or...?
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:15.460]   No, the fabric.
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:19.460]   So I use garter belt, the little garter belt ones with the little...
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:21.460]   Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:28.460]   Yeah, so anyway, so you latch those on and then you just spin them around the pipe.
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:29.460]   Perfect.
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:31.460]   And it allows you to pull them really tight.
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:34.460]   And if you do it correctly, you can pop them off really easily too.
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:37.460]   So anyway, so that's what I use for...
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.460]   I have a...
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.460]   As you know, I have a predisposition towards real sets like you have Renee.
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.460]   So I've been dressing my office.
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:45.460]   I would've.
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:46.460]   My issue was I just...
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:47.460]   I also thought it's good as Alex.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.460]   Well, I was delaying doing this for probably six months.
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:54.460]   I had parts of it built and everything else.
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:57.460]   And when this COVID thing hit, I was just like, "Well, I gotta start doing something."
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:59.460]   And I didn't have the set to do it.
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.460]   I didn't really have a budget to do it either.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.460]   So I was like, "You know what? I have a green screen laying in the garage.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.460]   I'm just gonna put the green screen up and I'm gonna figure it out."
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.460]   And I figured it out.
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.460]   But it wasn't what I planned.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:11.460]   And I like physical sets too because I feel like there's a lot...
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:14.460]   Like this kind of works with the other cameras that I have, but it's...
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:17.460]   You know, it's a little...the rest of it.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.460]   I bought new furniture, but I do need...
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.460]   We must have extra lights lying around, right, John?
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.460]   I mean, nobody's using that set or that set.
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.460]   I'll be able to bring some lights.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.460]   I do happen to own a few things.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:29.460]   I can bring some lights home.
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:30.460]   Totally can.
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:33.460]   Just mostly what we're worried about is not COVID.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.460]   We're fine doing this studio.
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:39.460]   But the fires, which will probably come back to Northern California in a few months.
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:45.460]   And our power was out for a week in last August or September maybe.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:51.460]   And I expect that to happen again, so we need some remote locations.
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:56.460]   I think a lot of people are trying to figure out remote locations.
[02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:57.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:58.460]   It's a good time for a lighting room.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:01:59.460]   Except if you don't have the gear.
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:00.460]   If you have to get the gear, forget it.
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.460]   You'll never get it.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:03.460]   I'm waiting for...
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:08.460]   It's gonna take me two weeks just to get the little dummy battery to put in my A7 so I can power it.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:10.460]   Even those are back ordered.
[02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:11.460]   Good Lord.
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:15.460]   It took me forever to get an AC adapter for the C500 because Canada decided not to make one.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.460]   Oh, nice.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:17.460]   Well, that's probably good.
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.460]   You probably saved money by getting a third party one.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:22.460]   Renee Richie, thank you so much.
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.460]   You got to watch Renee on YouTube.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:27.460]   Alex Lindsay, thank you so much.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.460]   You got to watch Alex on Zoom.
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:32.460]   And Andy Enoco, thank you so much.
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:35.460]   You got to listen to him on WGBH and Boston.
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:38.460]   Thank you all for joining us every week for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:39.460]   I love doing this show.
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:43.460]   It's so much fun to get together with my friends and talk about Apple stuff.
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:44.460]   I hope you enjoy it too.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.460]   We do it every Tuesday, right after iOS today.
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:51.460]   So tune in early, 9 a.m. for iOS today, 11 a.m.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:53.460]   That's Pacific time for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.460]   That'd be about 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:58.460]   It'd be about 1,700 UTC.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:02.460]   The live streams are always available on our website, twit.tv/live.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:04.460]   There's audio and video there.
[02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:06.460]   So you can just tune in, leave it running.
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.460]   But you know, you can even do that with your voice assistant.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:15.460]   You can say echo, play Twit Live, and it'll just play it, or Google, or HomePod, and just say play Twit Live.
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:20.460]   Sometimes you have to say on iHard or on TuneIn or some other thing, but usually get those going.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:23.460]   If you want to hear the latest version of any show, same thing.
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:24.460]   Just say the name.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:28.460]   You could say echo, play Mac Break Weekly, and it'll, or sometimes you have to say podcast.
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:31.460]   I can't understand why it sometimes gets it and sometimes doesn't.
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:36.460]   Of course, you can get on-demand versions of everything we do at our website, twit.tv.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:40.460]   This show is at twit.tv/mvw.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:44.460]   We also put it on YouTube. You can watch there. That's fine. We love that.
[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:47.460]   Best thing, though, the thing I would love the best is if you would subscribe.
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.460]   That way you'd get it every week. The minute it's available, you don't even think about it.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.460]   Just listen to it when you're in the mood.
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:58.460]   Pick out Pocketcast or Overcast or Apple's Podcast, whatever podcast client you like, and subscribe to Mac Break Weekly.
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:03.460]   Thanks, everybody. Time to get back to work because I'm sorry to say break time.
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:04.460]   So bye-bye.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:17.460]   [Music]
