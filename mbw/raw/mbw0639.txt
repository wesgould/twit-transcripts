[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.520]   Leo LaPorte you may know him because he usually sits in this chair and hosts this show, but he is out
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.180]   I am Megan Maroney and I am joined by the regular gang
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   Let's start with thought leader Anion Akko from WGBH in Chicago
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.480]   Welcome thought leader. I hope you are going to lead us with your thoughts
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.160]   This year calf tans only worn as scarves
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   And also Renee Richie

[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.240]   Thank you so much for having me again
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.120]   It's great to I'm sure Leo is off doing a tasting menu in some country in some city in some fabulous restaurant somewhere
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   But we're holding down the fort
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.480]   I'm I'm worried I'm worried that he's jeopardizing his restaurant reservation because he heard tell of a Pokemon somewhere nearby
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.560]   That's only available for the holidays probably and let let let let we not list we not forget less
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.360]   We're not gonna forget you Alex Lindsey
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   I use thought leader and youtuber
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.200]   Influencer of all the rest of the stuff Alex Lindsey from pixel core
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.720]   Hey, how's it going? It's got salt influencer. That's what I'll call you
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.560]   It's all about
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   2019 is all about bamboo
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   So I've never hosted this show before and I asked Carson before like what order do I go in?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   Do I go in the order you tell me to and he said I could do whatever I wanted so
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040]   Let's power. Yes
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.400]   Yes, whatever I want so let's let's start with
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   The feed the 5g story that came out yesterday
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.960]   Apple plans to wait until 2020 before releasing an iPhone that works with 5g
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.600]   This was according to Bloomberg Mark German's and friends
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.440]   Bloomberg is this a big deal? I mean this is what happens all the time right when we go to 3g and 4g
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   Apple waits a while right
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   Yeah, there's a conservative
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   Am I supposed to call on you guys?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:52.800]   I was gonna say Apple has historically been super conservative when it comes to radio technology like you mentioned
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.880]   There was no 3g in the first iPhone
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.600]   They didn't go to LTE the same time HD seated and as someone who used the HDC thunderbolt that lasted all of two hours on full charge and
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.680]   Maybe melted its way through a table or two
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.880]   It's usually because the initial chipsets are big and hot and power consuming and just aren't as good as a second and third
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.520]   Generation chips so Apple typically waits and also by the time the second and third generation chips come out the technology is actually deployed
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   Where a greater percentage not even a large but a greater percentage of people can use it
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.440]   One of the things that's really important is understanding how complicated 5g is going to be
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.760]   So a lot of us are talking about it and 5g is going to come out very slowly for most of the country
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   It is a the density of the transponders that are required and you know, it's two every 250 feet
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.160]   And so there are lots of little there are little transponders
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.400]   But there's lots of them and it is going to be very difficult to get those out past the center of a lot of cities
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.920]   And so it's going to take it's probably the most expensive rollout
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.200]   It's probably it's also why we're seeing such a push to get rid of
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.360]   Net neutrality is because of how much money is about to be spent on getting 5g rolled out now once it's out
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320]   There's a lot of opportunities, but it's not going to happen by 2020
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.680]   And so there's where we're going to see 5g and where we're going to feel left out if if anywhere is going to be at large event spaces where
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.760]   They start to really push that so a Moscone and arena
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   You know, those types of things are probably going to see
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.560]   You know that because it's there's a lot of
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.720]   Point of sale opportunities that are going to be new for 5g and so we're going to see those there
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.520]   We're going to see them in dense populated areas
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.880]   But as soon as you get out, I mean literally not even get out of San Francisco
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.680]   As soon as you get near the bridge you're probably going to go back down to 4g
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.920]   For the foreseeable future and so I think apple is probably it's probably a great investment on theirs or a great noninvestment on there
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.400]   Is to wait probably until 2020 or even 2021
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.120]   What is feeling left out look like like what does that look like if we're you know, is it?
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.120]   Are we really need that much faster?
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.360]   Yeah, that's really fast
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.040]   Like it's faster than your faster than your cable network, you know, like it's it's they're talking
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.440]   I mean the the raw speed of the network is in the terms of gigs
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.000]   You know, they're definitely going to be able to serve you
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   High high hundreds of megabits per second
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   Latency is a big deal because it's going to be much lower
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.960]   The latencies can be in the sub 10 range although it probably in working in reality probably won't be that quite that low
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.080]   But it's it's a completely different it's it's as fast or faster than your home network
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.960]   I mean what we're really looking at is for 5g is eventually getting to a point where you don't have cable at home
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.080]   And a Wi-Fi network and it's probably why apple
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.840]   My guess is why apple might have let go of Wi-Fi
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   Because I think that you know five people slowly take over that that whole era where you're not really and that's why
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.200]   The advantage for t-mobile and the advantage for a lot of other folks is being able to move into that market
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.600]   The the traditional cable cable tv market
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   But of course what they need to do is
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.680]   You know, there's a lot of wrangling that they have to do number one is getting that density number two is
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.760]   Probably negotiating zero rating for most of the uh media
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.200]   Organizations, which is again why they probably want to get rid of uh net neutrality more than anything else
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   They just want to zero rate a lot of things
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.840]   um
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.360]   And uh, and so there's uh, there's all of that's going to be a wrestling match that's going to happen over the next two or three years
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   And so I apple
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.440]   To the point that in the rename aid all the chips will be expensive. They'll be power hungry
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.920]   Um, they they won't integrate. Well
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.840]   Second third generation is going to be a lot better the market the the infrastructure that they're setting into is going to be better
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   We will hear people complain about it by 2021 of
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.640]   You know, I went to there's all these cool things I could do with the stadium with my samsung and I couldn't do with my my iphone
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.680]   Um, but we're pretty far out. It's going to take a long time and a lot of money to get the 5g
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.040]   um
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   Market, you know set up
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.160]   And d
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   Right now the problem is that 5g is a solution for one of a problem
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.520]   uh, one of the reasons why lte really took the uh really
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.320]   Took everyone by storm is that it solves so many problems or people with phones are like god
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.680]   I really I can't why can't I watch netflix on the bus or why can I uh, why can't I uh, why can I uh upload this like
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.480]   1080p video uh to uh my friends and to my feed uh and have to
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   What why do I have to like wait like an hour for this thing to upload whereas with 5g
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.680]   lte is fine for everything that people do with mo with mobile right now
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:28.240]   So what it's going to take is for someone to come up with the killer app or the killer product whether it's
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.560]   wearables that are
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   constantly communicating what you're seeing to someone else and constantly having to receive what other people are seeing
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   uh, or whether it's just simply the idea of
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.760]   Uh cable companies wanting to stop having to lay new cable and wanting to simply build towers instead
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.080]   Uh, it's it's going to take a long time for anybody to adopt even the the uh, motorola
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.240]   I think was bragging about how
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.840]   Uh, this this this new phone that they're selling is going to be the first one that will be 5g compatible
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.920]   Because that what it's that model that they have where it has pogo pins in the back so you can slap on like a camera slap on a battery
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.320]   So they're promising that sometime in the future. They're going to build like a 5g thing you can slap onto that
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.720]   Um, sam sung to has said
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   One 5g phone next year and you know that they're pretty much planning that they're only going to be selling it to people who are in the business
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.120]   Who need to test out 5g networks? So yeah, this is it could take a few years for the it's this to become important
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.640]   And even when it becomes important it might not be important for a phone to have it
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.240]   So, uh, let's move on to what I think is one of the biggest stories of last week
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:44.400]   Uh apple music is coming to echo devices. This is very exciting and super interesting because everyone's saying like oh amazon and
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.960]   And apple are now friends, but it really makes you think if people I mean if apple really just at some point just realized they're selling more apple music subscriptions
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.480]   And they are home pods
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.320]   I looked at the numbers a little bit. There's
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.080]   At last check there's around 50 million apple music subscribers and also 50 million echo devices. So it's like around the same
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.480]   Number, uh, andy, what do you think about apple music coming to the echo?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:16.160]   That's a really really big deal of mind. Why usual complaints is about apple is that it really it's not impressive impressive to me that you've
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.920]   Apples created an apple service that runs on apple hardware. That's running apple operating systems
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   Uh, the big deal is when you try to make something that appeals to everybody even the people who paid
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.480]   $29 on black friday to get this cute little echo dot
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.560]   Uh, so for everyone who's who's subscribing to uh apple music
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.360]   It makes the product that much more valuable
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.280]   That now that they can use it on the stuff that they've already got and i'd have to spend 350
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.040]   Just to listen to their playlists in the kitchen while they're cooking
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.360]   So yeah, it's it's a huge huge step for the
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.040]   For the usability of apple music and I hope
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.000]   I hope that apple starts to fail in more hardware segments so that they start to open up like iMessage and they start to open up
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.280]   Other things uh to to other users because they have great stuff and I just wish that people who don't necessarily either not chosen
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.040]   Or can't afford apple hardware could get access to these wonderful software and services
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.640]   Andy, what do you think
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.560]   I mean apple music has historically been different from apple when they first launched it
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.360]   They bought it from beats and it ran on ios and android and the surprise of some apple didn't
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.680]   Cancel the android part of it
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.440]   They actually deployed a whole new apple music version for android
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.680]   And I think the thinking at the time was there are going to be people who get a family plan for this
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.400]   And they are going to be cross device multi device households
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.880]   I'll have some ios people some android people and it creates better value for them if they can play it
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   On any of the devices regardless of what the kids have what the parents has all of that
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.760]   And I think this is very much that but taken to the the new level of popularity that home assistants have and if you get
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.920]   An apple music plan and you have a home pod or you don't you have iphones
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.040]   But you also have echoes this just makes that plan way more valuable to you and I think it behooves apple
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   And their position in the market to make apple music especially family plans
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.720]   Not just as convenient but as good an experience as possible for people
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.680]   So do we all subscribe to apple music?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.400]   I do yes and spotify
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   No
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.440]   Alex just recently convinced me
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   To to subscribe to spotify because he just I just did the numbers and I thought like
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   I'm not able to listen to the music that I want to listen to on all of my echo devices
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.760]   And you know really another $10 a month is at that big of a deal
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   But now I feel like why would I have it at all because I now I know how to transfer my playlists back and forth
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.160]   I mean is there any reason to keep are you guys going to keep spotify the two of you that still have it?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.000]   I
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.960]   I still haven't figured out I have a lot of playlists on spotify
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.440]   And I've I have not I have yet to get one playlist that has more than 100 songs get from what get from spotify to apple music
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.640]   Successfully, you know with with all the different import tools. I'm like how hard could this be? It's a it's a band
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.320]   It's not even like that rare. It's a band and a song but evidently that's a very complicated thing for these guys to do and so
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.600]   So I haven't completely changed over
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.000]   There's something about the spotify playlist building process that I find I can't quite put my finger on it that I just find
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.320]   Uh more seamless and I can't I can't exactly figure out so I have a tendency not to
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   um think that I'm gonna
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.200]   Do it mostly for app for me apple music is so that I can just say hey play this
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   You know that's that's the service that I that I needed to do and it seems to do that pretty well
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   But I don't build any lists there
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.800]   I feel like spotify thinks I'm cooler than I really am like the music
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.120]   It recommends to me is like oh that sounds good
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.680]   Whereas I don't know maybe just apple music and itunes is so like my recommendations are so old
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.840]   It's still be like a lot of
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.800]   Music that I made my kids listen to or that my kids made me listen to so that is um, you know
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.320]   Just suddenly um Megan trainer pops up a lot
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.200]   That's not me. I mean it might be me, but it's not the me that I want to project to the world spotify knows
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's interesting. Yeah, I think that's interesting because I don't listen to anything that it recommends
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.560]   I mean, I don't I don't ever try
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.360]   I mean I just I guess I have all these playlists and if I hear a song
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.440]   Usually my and I think this is why apple was good. It was a good buy to buy shazam
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.880]   If I hear a song that I like at starbucks or it, you know some somewhere else or or I'm you know
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.920]   Someone's playing it on the on a car. I'll I'll shazam it and then but then I put it in my spotify list
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.480]   But I don't I don't really expect spotify. I'm not like I never was one of the people that liked pandora
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.720]   You know, I don't really need a I guess i'm too picky m too like I don't like that and so uh, so
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.840]   It's never really worked for me to go to go down that path
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.360]   Well, you brought up um and he brought up like maybe bringing iMessage to android like that
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.840]   I mean, I know you were kind of joking, but that that's not the next step, right?
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.280]   Because that would mean that they you know, I mean iMessage is sells iPhones, right?
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.600]   Don't you think they're never gonna open that up for a whole bunch of reasons. They're not gonna open it up
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   I don't think that's a it was a
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.560]   Talk about but sorry
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.800]   No, I said it keeps people on iPhones, but it's always very careful like bbm blackberry messenger kept people on blackberries for a long time
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.880]   It is either like a sign that you worked on wall street or wanted to wanted to be near people who did but then what's app just
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.400]   Cloned everything about bbm went cross platform and took all the value out of it end up being worth 10 times more than blackberries a company
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.960]   So there's a fine line between proprietary services and when you need to take them open and I don't think apples anywhere near that line yet
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.160]   But it would be something interesting to watch in the in the years ahead as apple services business becomes more important
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.560]   I think that it's more for them. They just don't want to support something else like they don't want to have to deal with it
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.240]   Um, it's well, there's no business right there's no way to monetize it because they're not going to sell ads against it and sticker packs
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   Are not going to do it and it's adding a billion users. There's a lot of server activity
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.080]   Well, yeah
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.960]   You're going what about a subscription service. I mean somebody joe don't twitter that nobody'll pay for it though
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.440]   Yeah, I mean I joke because I would pay 20 for the one woman in my book group that
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:05.520]   That still has a pixel or that has a pixel because it's just and I feel like I have one in every group of
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.160]   Big group chats that I have and it just ruins everything you can't rename the group
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.960]   And you can't every every message that comes in is like so and so like this so and so love this
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.480]   Maybe iMessage for the web though like instead of android and windows and whatever support
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:28.240]   I just having iMessage for iCloud could be a way to sort of do enough just enough like they do with i work to get people over that hump
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.800]   Yeah, well because it's so I find go ahead
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.720]   I just said I find that if I if I have someone that I other than probably Andy
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.000]   But almost anybody that's a green message on mine. I find some other platform to talk to them
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.680]   Like I just don't like I don't like if they say if I see a green message
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.200]   They're gonna start getting messages from me on messenger or on LinkedIn or something else because you know like I I'm like
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.360]   I'm not gonna do that like I just the cross phone thing as soon as I see green message
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.920]   I mean I I go back and forth with Andy, but that's I think Andy's the only one that I talked to with a green message
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.640]   Yeah, I think uh Jason howl and florin's eye on are my green message people and you're right
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.000]   I found other ways to communicate with them, but they're technical people
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.120]   Like the you know women that are my close friends are not always as technical
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.360]   Which means most of them are on iPhones, but then there's the occasional person that's been convinced into a pixel and
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.560]   You know, I guess my only choice is to not be friends with them anymore
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.920]   Yeah, like Alex that defaults to facebook messenger for me very quickly and all my friends all my family use iMessage
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.960]   But there are people in my community that I have to organize things with and then it just defaults to messenger because everybody has it
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.360]   We're gonna talk more apple stuff Renee delve deep into the mystery of where the airpower
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.600]   Is why we haven't seen it. I want to find out about that and apple announced its best of 2018
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.200]   Uh, we are not on it, but um that is okay
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.240]   Uh, I'm all for the frog dissection app that is on it and we'll talk about that too
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.840]   But first I want to thank our sponsor for this show privacy.com
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.720]   If you listen to this show or really any shows that leo host you probably
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.840]   Have tons of subscriptions you've signed up for everything and then you go and look at your credit car bill and think oh
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.440]   I'm still paying for that. You don't want to do that anymore and I have a way that you can stop doing that

[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:47.280]   So why use the same credit card number when you shop online privacy.com generates a brand new virtual visa card number
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.680]   For every single purchase that you make online and it's just one click
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.360]   It doesn't take a lot of time virtual cards are locked to a merchant

[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:09.840]   All righty, uh, let's see. Oh, we were talking about getting uh about the home pod and how you know
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.200]   It's much more expensive than the echo devices
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:21.280]   Uh, and I guess it's more expensive for a reason and uh apple wanted to prove that so they um just released this really long
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.840]   Uh, there's a lot of math in it along white paper about what's inside
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.520]   Uh, the home pod. Alex. What did you think of uh of that?
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.400]   I thought it was stunning
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.520]   So I I uh, I I read it a couple times and we we spent a little time talking about it someone that works with uh, with me
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.880]   Um has spent a lot of time doing a very high quality dsp work. So, um
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.600]   And so the two of us talked about it a little bit and it is it is really fascinating
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.920]   Uh, what what they're doing there. It's not so much that it's you know, they're all of it is there
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:01.360]   Uh, it's just understanding how complicated it is when syria doesn't react to you to understand like what syria has to do to make that actually work
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.480]   I think is fascinating. So there's you know, you basically have this
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.720]   Um, you have a multi channel echo cancellation, which is the mcec
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.920]   Uh, and then you also have the residual echo suppressor, which is the res the spp
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.320]   Which is the speech presence probability the mcwf, which is the multi channel
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.280]   Weiner filter, which is actually a thing
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.840]   And the uh and the dnn
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.200]   Uh, which is the d neural network and so basically the what they're what they're doing is is that that what
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.960]   Uh, all of those things those are all in the paper here. Um, it's not you know anything
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.720]   We anything we know does not have any part of this, but it's a weiner filter. It's it's a uh, um, but the
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.520]   Basically it has to make a decision. So there's a bunch of things that that the speaker has to do
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.480]   And a lot of what they were talking about is being able to handle your you know, be what what it's looking for is
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.160]   Ask you know, hey, you know, so the hey, c'mon now the hey, c'mon by itself is complicated because
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.240]   You're in a different place in the building. Uh, you you meet all over the room
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.960]   You might have an accent. You might you know have uh ambient noise
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.120]   So it has to go through and and get rid of all of those things. So there's some basic noise filtering
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.520]   Uh, that's sampling, you know, what's out there
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.040]   It's it's distinguishing you but not only does it have to distinguish you but it has to distinguish you from many other voices
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.920]   So it's probably making you know what they're talking about is making decisions about
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.680]   You know which channel to look at, you know, as far as it's it's picking up all these different voices and it has to model that
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.440]   Now the the reason that that command is so important is because that is actually much easier when you're talking to
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.040]   We're going to have this for quite a few years until we have more powerful chips
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.880]   It's important that it is a specific thing that you have to say to it because then that that marker that it's looking for is
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.840]   Is smaller but around that when you say hey
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:50.160]   Or hey, whatever I shouldn't say that on the on the air, but none of my device went off which is confusing that they didn't
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.520]   Um
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.400]   Uh, but the uh when you say that command
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.120]   Uh, it then has to start separating you out from everything else is that that's there
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.400]   So there's an array of six mics those are there
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.920]   It's it's it has to deal with the reflections of all the audio in the room
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.240]   It has to model what that what that looks like it's talking about moving knolls around to decide okay
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.880]   I'm going to ignore these areas. These are the the areas of uh of that are most problematic
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.680]   And so there's an enormous amount of work. I mean it was just
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.160]   Fascinating it's not that none of it makes sense. It's just that when you look at it
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:30.000]   It is and it's it's amazing at the enormous amount of processing that's going on just so that it can respond to you
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.240]   And all of these speakers are doing something like it
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   Um, but what they're you know a lot of what they're doing is you know doing heavy, you know a lot of training using the
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.560]   You some of it's off site where they're they're training these uh, you know training the model
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.480]   And some of it's constantly reacting and dynamically responding to your uh to your room
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.880]   So it's you know, and then the hardest part is when you they're talking about when the music is playing
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.840]   Your voice may be 30 or 40 decibels
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.800]   Lower than the and 30 40 decibels. I mean just be clear 30 40
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.640]   40 decibels you can barely hear it
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.240]   So 40 decibels is a long way back behind the music
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   Um for them to be able to pull something out of that uh is is kind of uh, it's amazing
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.000]   Uh, we've we've had we have to deal with a lot of noise suppression in what what I do
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And so um watching you know looking at that breakdown was was fascinating
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.120]   You could probably spend a week just studying that paper and all the papers that it's can that it that it references
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.360]   And you'd learn a lot about you know audio processing it. It's a if you haven't read it
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.840]   I I had to read it and then I put it into speak mode
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.320]   Like speech mode and I listened to it and read it again
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   It took me a little while to kind of dig through all the little all the things that they're doing
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.720]   And I think I still need to read it a couple times, but definitely worth the read
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.320]   Um, it's it's it's it's a really great little window into how much work it is to have these things be
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.800]   Relatively effortless
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.000]   What did you think Renee?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Yeah, I thought exactly what Alex said in terms of the raw technology that they were bringing to bear and when apple first announced that at ww
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.880]   DC
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.560]   And krak fedderik he said he could whisper across the room and and it could hear him
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.000]   You know, there were a lot of guffaws because syri does have a bad reputation
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.320]   Uh when it comes to just detecting voice in general, but this was apple's first real farfield device
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.200]   It's plugged into outlets that had a beamforming arrays of microphones that was doing everything that
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.120]   Living room devices like the echo had been doing for a while. So they had to figure out farfield syri
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.760]   We've got air pods which are near field syri and phones, which are kind of near to mid range
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.480]   But this was a device that could be across the room around the corner up the stairs all of those things
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.240]   But I think what's even more fascinating is that apple published this apple
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   Is not a company that usually opens a kimono and shows off how it does things
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.920]   But they've had this tension with machine learning and artificial intelligence experts
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.360]   Who really want to be and want to have their work in the public eye
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.680]   Not just because they want to build up their credibility though
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.600]   I'm sure they do but because they want to share the information they're part of academic communities
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.320]   And they're part of larger efforts to sort of work out the big challenges in artificial intelligence
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.920]   Machine learning computer vision natural language processing all of these monumental tasks
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.240]   And it just it's it's great that apple
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.120]   Has the I don't want to call it confidence because it's not that but has the willingness to sort of let all this information out
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.040]   And I hope they really continue the machine learning blog has just been sorry the machine learning journal
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   It's just been fascinating to read
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   I mean, I do really appreciate that about the home pod, especially now that i've used
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:34.000]   It more and more for home automation as you know, I've got my all my house set up now on uh smart plugs
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.280]   Uh, especially for the with all the holiday lights and it's so nice to be able to just be anywhere and talk to
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.880]   You talk to the home pod. I mean the home pod is usually who listens
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   I recorded a video of myself because I was so excited about being able to turn my lights off and on with my voice
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.360]   I know i'm sure most people have already been able to do that, but I was very excited about it
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   Um, but then I don't know what you know people complained because they were I was turning their tree on and off
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.800]   Uh when they were playing the video because I included the you know, hey
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.120]   Siri well, you can I mean
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.280]   If you set up a shortcut that was just yo siri ho ho ho and all your lights came on me again for like the christmas tree
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   That would be amazing. I
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.120]   I can do that. I have the power. I could do that right now. Yes
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.360]   Shortcut to a diehard christmas
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.600]   Uh, yeah, so that I thought that was really interesting. I thought it was interesting that um
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:34.160]   That all of that came right on the heels of uh of opening apple music to um
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.440]   To amazon echoes because it it felt like apple is also saying like yes
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.240]   We understand that our home pod is really expensive and this well
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.560]   It's also super interesting because it came right on the heels of amazon starting to sell all of apple stuff
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.720]   Yes, it goes to the deepening of the relationship between those two companies in the mutually beneficial deepening of that relationship
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.600]   But are they selling home pods? Isn't that the one thing they're not selling?
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.360]   No, they're not selling home pods, but they are selling iPhones iPads and they're getting
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.640]   Almost like first name. What do they call it? Alex first first citizens treatment?
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.160]   Yes in class. I think the only thing we're missing now is being able to order books on audible
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   We still have the apple tv it looks like I forget someone tweeted yesterday that you can add hbo on the apple tv
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.760]   Uh, maybe it was ben tomsen like they are deepening the hooks that they'll have between the two companies
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   So maybe these are just first steps
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.320]   I can I have the hbo go. Oh never me. Oh, so I have the hb o go not hbo now
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.280]   But you can do hbo now on on the apple tv, right? But there was a there was a prime
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   Functionality because you can I think also get it through prime and there was a little boxing
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.320]   Do you subscribe to prime or do you want to subscribe to hbo through prime?
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.640]   Which is not normal on an apple tv?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.280]   Moving on nine to five mac has a story about an all-new design for the air pods
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.960]   But that's not until 2020 but apparently we might get wireless charging first
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.960]   Uh in 2019 and the in the case will be upgraded so that that's how we'll get the wireless charging
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.200]   um
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.880]   Andy, what do you think about a new set of air pods? Do you need them?
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.640]   Uh, well the old the thing the thing with the earphones of any kind is that as long as they work
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.840]   So not so long as they sound good for the person who's using them
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.760]   And I'm not the person
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.320]   I'm not the person who's buying like 800 dollar headphones
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.440]   I'm the person who's using like 80 dollar headphones and the air cup is starting to come apart
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.320]   And I should probably spend 10 dollars on a new pair of ear cups
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.680]   But I haven't gone around to it yet because it doesn't affect the sound and in one bit
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.880]   And as long as the connectivity works long as the bluetooth is still good
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.840]   It's not a huge priority. Everyone's really waiting for uh for wireless charging
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.920]   So I think that most people who are looking to upgrade their air pods are air pods waiting for that as for uh
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.520]   Other updates. I don't know. I think I think that the the only thing that the only disadvantage that the current air pods have
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.920]   For some people is that you still have that sort of like candlesticks sticking out of your ear
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.880]   Whereas in the past couple years all the other truly wireless earbuds that have come along
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.560]   Are actually kind of like earbuds. So they'll be nice to see something that's more uh more discreet
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.640]   It would also be nice to have something with like more tap sensors on it so that you can interact
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.560]   A lot more with your device with it volume up volume down track skip
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:24.800]   Siri instead of having to just choose one thing to put to adjust the tap to it'd be nice if
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.040]   Uh, I could simply it could be sort of like an apple watch for the ears
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.680]   Uh, so I'd be really excited to update if they did that
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.360]   Uh, but I think most people yeah huge priorities going to be get wireless charging if only to save face
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.840]   To actually ship the darn thing
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.760]   I don't I think if you already own air pods, I don't see any reason to buy new ones
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.360]   Unless the unless the connectivity works much better. There's a better range
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.600]   I noticed that the one thing I have learned is that
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:58.400]   My air pods do not handle polygamous relationships very well. So they uh, you know, you start
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.480]   Yeah
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:07.280]   Mostly will mostly will dull. Yeah, so so the the the uh, when I mean by that of course is that if you start connecting into lots of things
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:14.160]   I got we're not judging if the relationship works for you. So songs is communication and honestly
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.600]   Big blue tooth love
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.640]   Yeah, sorry
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.600]   I
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.680]   I felt I felt like some some of our listeners might have felt like they've been targeted or judged. I want to
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:29.040]   Yes, I said personally me if this my experience. Yeah, yeah, exactly
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:35.280]   Yeah, so I I started connecting them to a lot of uh different devices different iPads and my my computer and my
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.760]   And now they're just confused. I had to reset them. You know, like really reset the whole thing and say, okay
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.440]   I don't you only have to pay attention to this phone
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.400]   So so I think that maybe being able to manage that a little bit more effectively would be great
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.520]   the
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.960]   I I do think that uh, they do flip out every once in a while
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.160]   It seems like in the new operating in the new the newest updates to the phone
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.920]   They don't seem quite as stable as they were which they were rock stable before
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.200]   So I think they're they're probably working through something there
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.680]   Uh, but I think that overall if you have the air pods unless they make some radical change
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.720]   I I don't think they're going to get rid of the the carrot stick or the little stick coming out of your ear because I think
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.640]   uh, it is
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   Dramatically improves the quality of your voice when you're talking on the phone
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.240]   I mean most of the ones that are that are pods that just go into your ear
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.960]   If you really committed to just listening they work great if you actually want to use them for the phone
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:31.200]   Uh, they don't they don't work nearly as well. So so I think that those that you know, that's probably the why they're going to
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.760]   Remain that way. I don't I don't expect any kind of major
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.200]   Form change. I think uh, if you didn't have them before this will be another good reason to get them if you have them
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.520]   You'll probably wait for something radical
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.880]   For me, there's a couple things that are super interesting like the you'll probably be able to get just a charging case
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.760]   So if all you want is the wireless charging you'll probably be able to get those for your first gen air pods and keep going
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:57.120]   Uh, it does depend on your battery life because they will they will degrade in battery life over time and after two years or so
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.960]   Maybe maybe you want to refresh if you travel a lot, but I think otherwise for a lot of people the sweatproofing will be beneficial
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.800]   Especially people want to wear them to work out
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.040]   I know not everybody and it's not a large scale problem
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.760]   But some people do sweat a lot and over time continued exposure either to rain when you're running outside or to sweat when you're working out inside
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.080]   Does have a dilatarious effect on the electronics
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.720]   So that that will be great for some people on board series depending on the status of your internet connection or whether the devices you have with you
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.200]   And eventually, you know, as as you start looking towards 2020 and beyond
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.320]   If you start having on board apple music for example where it can just attach to any wireless network
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.800]   You've already attached to the way an apple watch could two generations ago before it got lte
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.760]   And you don't even have to have your watch with you anymore when you work out
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.800]   Those will probably be the features that people like I agree with Andy that the stock still looks funny
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.320]   But I've tried the other ones too and they really aren't good for capturing
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.520]   Not just for phone calls
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.080]   But if you want to use your air pods when you're recording video if you're if you're running gunning it or things like that
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.560]   I know that's a niche need but for some people it's
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.280]   Yeah, for some people it's still important for me though
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.400]   I have one ear that's great for ear pods and the other ear is so mangled from jiu-jitsu that it just it isn't great
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.360]   So if they could figure out um a way to cater to a slightly wider scenario of years
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.760]   I would love them it long time as well. So you're wearing one air pod right now Renee
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.560]   I almost always do I can wear too. I'm not usually listening to music. I'm usually listening to podcasts
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.160]   Or I'm doing video recording and stuff and I only need one air pod and this year is fine
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.000]   But the other ear has been mangled even worse
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   So it doesn't it just doesn't stay in as well
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.560]   Do you have the other air pod because one of my air pods is broken but yeah that one so if you could send
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.480]   I usually last just long enough for me to have to switch the you know for the
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.720]   Uh, yeah, I think mine are still covered by apple care
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.640]   This is the second pair that I've had because the first ones just stopped working and then
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.960]   Uh, I sent them back and they sent me another one. I don't know I might be out of apple care
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.040]   But they don't um I have weirdly shaped ears both of them and they just don't stay in unless I'm sitting very still
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.320]   So they're way better like I cannot wear traditional air
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.920]   Uh, the headones at all they will pop like they were literally pop out as if they're popcorn
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.880]   So this is a huge improvement for me, but we're just not all the way yet
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   And this kind of a big deal that that's why I do wear like the over the ear muffs because my my ear my ear hole endurance for
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:21.440]   Uh, air pods or the even the regular wired ones is about 45 minutes to an hour and usually we record for like at least 90 minutes
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.240]   And that's one less thing for me to worry about so it's such a particular thing, isn't it?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.880]   Yeah, I'm not supposed to be working on the headphones too. So we'll have a choice eventually
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.280]   Right. I do find in my limit for the air pods is mostly when the battery dies
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.680]   I just leave them on I forget that they're there. I'm just kind of like doing away and then I hear that
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.760]   You know how many times are you gonna hear the little dude to to warn you that you are
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:52.400]   About sensitive. I'm a sensitive little milk toast. I I have delicate ears. I don't I don't have working man's ears like you do
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.720]   Well, I think if I use ears have never known a day of hard work in their entire life
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:03.040]   I just think I have I have I have bees in my in my ear so often and then I have in ear like everything that I've had for the last
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.000]   10 years has all been stuck in my ear and in different way shapes or forms
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.040]   So I think that it's I'm uh, I'm a I've course years
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.800]   They don't they don't care anymore about any of those things. I do I am surprised at how quickly I got used to I thought that I would never give
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.080]   up my wired
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.720]   headphones because you know they're they do block out the sound more I use these little edamatic
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:27.280]   Wired wired headsets, but the only time I use them now is when my air pods batteries died
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.760]   And uh, which doesn't happen very often because I'm a little neurotic about about charging them
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.280]   But I I never thought I'd get to that point where I didn't want to use the wired ones
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.040]   So Renee where yes is the air power is it like where's Waldo?
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.800]   Like we're not looking hard enough if we looked harder. We'd find it where is the airpower?
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.760]   I mean, it's it's in Cupertino, California
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.320]   I mean where it's always been it's just that it hasn't gotten to the point where apple can ship it yet
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.840]   And it's one of those things where apples usually a company that doesn't pre-announce things
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.640]   But they're also a company that when they do make a radical change
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.120]   They like to have some sort of technological accessory to go along with it
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:09.920]   Just sort of seal the deal to show off a little bit like air pods were when they went when they got rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.480]   They were like we're gonna make wireless headphones better
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.320]   And then they got rid of the metal back and they're like we're gonna make wireless charging better
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.240]   But it turns out wireless charging is is okay on its own
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.160]   But when you want to start wirelessly charging a phone a watch that uses a different kind of wireless charging more magnetism
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.680]   Magnetic based as well as inductive and air pods things that have different capacity requirements as well
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.080]   That gets super complicated and they just from all all the stories
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.040]   We're hearing they just were not able to make that a functional product
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.080]   At least as originally designed and at least not yet
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.560]   And I mean, I guess they deserve some base level of credit for not shipping a terribly broken product because that would literally be
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:55.840]   Even worse, but it's just they were they were hoping to get it out. I think early 2018 then summer 2018
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.440]   Then fall 2018 and if you read all the articles and all the stuff
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.320]   They bought companies to try to fix some of the problem
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.480]   They they hired really smart people to try to fix the people who are confident they could
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.560]   And it just is not working up to the standards of a shipping product
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.760]   And I think the lessons we take from this one is that just you know as much as you might want to pre-announce
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.600]   You should only ever pre-announce when you're you know weeks away not when you're months away
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.800]   Uh, and two, you know some it is better not to ship and to ship really bad things. So
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.440]   Uh, maybe maybe 2019, but will they be the same product is the bigger question?
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.800]   And I think there's some pressure. I think the problem for apple is is the idea of of saying well, we couldn't do it
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.680]   So we have released something different is a pretty difficult conversation for that company to have
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.600]   As much as it is to say that we haven't gotten to it yet. Uh, it's it's it's all
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.200]   Public though. I mean in private they reboot over and over and over again, but this one went public way too soon
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.520]   I don't think that they're gonna do this like the idea of announcing something that far out
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.080]   I mean they did it with the home pod. They did it. You know, they've they've done it in the past with the iMac pro
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.040]   You know, so there's there's been a track record of doing that more recently than they did before
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.600]   But I I think this is a this is a pretty good lesson. I think the hard part for them is once they get past the yes
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:14.640]   I think ces we're probably gonna see a lot of different wireless charging solutions and uh, it'll be an uphill battle in the same way that they
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.160]   It's an uphill battle for them to make penetration where where the echo
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.760]   Uh, and the and the google home are already implanted
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.800]   Uh, they're gonna have a hard time making this really worth it after uh after january of hip wry
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.560]   So when they go ahead also, I think I just quickly I think that wireless charging is kind of special because
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:40.640]   It can never be perfect because all you can do is make it easier to line up the device with the right pad to make charging work
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.920]   I mean if it was the the platonic ideal of wireless charging is literally a bowl
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:52.160]   And you just drop what you want into this beautiful like bowl. That's not this beautiful johnny. I've designed bowl
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.640]   That's on your nightstand and it's somehow
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:02.160]   It somehow finds like electricity inside the bowl and so you got two phones and you got to watch and it just plain works
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:10.240]   But so long as it's always going to be it's it's it's a it's it's not a lateral improvement over plugging in something into the base
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:18.320]   Uh, but it's almost a lateral improvement to having like a phone stand where it's almost as easy as dropping it in to make that connection
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:24.480]   So I I would be really really pleased if apple focused on features rather than simply wireless charging like
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.480]   Again, like I said to make it sort of like an apple watch for the ears to make it so that you can interact with your phone or your watch
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:37.600]   For things that don't that shouldn't even require you to even raise your wrist to really get the computers inside there
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.520]   Figuring out that actually I think I can predict and plan what this person
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.280]   Uh would want to say or how they would want to respond to this notification
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.440]   So i'll just give them a yes or no question
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.040]   Uh that they could then figure out or just a tap that they could simply navigate through
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:58.000]   So that's that would really set them apart from all of the really really excellent 170 dollar true wireless bluetooth buds that are out there
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.800]   There are also two two big areas where uh like air pods did change the game a little bit for wireless headphones
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.400]   Because of the w1 chip and the instant pairing a lot of the features that they provided
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.840]   But airpower wasn't really going to change much because they're the two big revolutions
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:19.360]   We need in wireless charging are ubiquity so that every starbucks and coffee shop and restaurant and uber and lift and airplane that you go
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.400]   Into as soon as you put your things down, they just start charging and that's that's something that just time and scale
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.880]   We'll solve but also lack of contact like to andy's point a little a little device that you put on your table
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:38.240]   And then anything within six inches of it just charges is way better for people than having to line up things and put them on a mat and put them on an area
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.360]   And those airpower doesn't address either either of those things
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:48.560]   I will admit that i will admit the flaw in my in my bowl plan because immediately like the cat would sleep in there and then
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.920]   They either get super powers or the electric cat
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:58.880]   Well, I think the problem is is that is that the problem the problem with all of these for me is that it costs a lot more money to put
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.480]   These in different places and for me what keeps my stuff charged is the fact that every place I sit down regularly
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.160]   I have some way to charge stuff and so i've got uh, you know some version of three or four or five
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.520]   uh
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.600]   outputs of usb that i'm kind of plugging stuff into so anywhere i'm going to sit down
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.920]   Whether it's my car my office my where I go to bed by the tv
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:26.000]   I just have places to set it down. I don't want to invest in a wireless charger for each one of those locations and to be honest with you
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.040]   I think it would be a pain in the neck because a lot of times I want to charge it while i'm using it and so so i don't
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.520]   I talked about it a lot. I just don't know even if they come out with that i'd be hard pressed to even buy it
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.760]   I just I don't see how it improved my life at all
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.800]   I'll just i'll just say that the if you because it's all
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.800]   All based on the cheese standard you can buy cheese chargers for 10 15 right 20 dollars
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.480]   So so so it's not the same thing as these like, uh,
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   Hue light bulbs that now i've replaced every light bulb with my house
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:00.640]   You start off by putting buying a charger wireless charger for the one or two places where it makes the most sense
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.760]   And then two years later you look around say wow I actually do have a wireless charger like everywhere
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.320]   I'm likely to sit down and drop my phone. It's excellent
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:17.040]   So I have one last question about this when they say it wasn't working was it an issue of it not charging or was it like setting fires to our bedside table?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.760]   So there was like three different issues that have been talked about one is that yeah, it was overheating
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.280]   They weren't able to get control of thermals because basically it had to be a little computer
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   It ran a stripped down version of ios so that it could communicate and handle and understand the different charging and provide the messages because
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   They created a whole interface where it would show up on your iphone when you put your watch down when you put your
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.000]   Your headphones down it was super ambitious and therein, you know lies lies the problems
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.880]   The other one is I believe someone said they're having communication problems
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.440]   Although I find that harder to believe because they're in such close proximity and bluetooth is a is a known thing
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.840]   But the last one I forget what it was but it's need to do with the way the coils
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.240]   Were picked because it involved like 21 different coils order to handle all the different possible
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:03.520]   Positions and devices because you could have two iphones or an iphone and air power air pods and an apple watch and just the level of
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   Complexity introduced too many problems
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:12.320]   Well, I want to talk about apples announcements at the best of 2018
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.760]   But before we do that, I want to talk about the best toilet of 2018
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:24.560]   Is the toto wash lit you don't even have to get a whole new toilet. You can just get the top
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:31.920]   Leo talks about this all the time. So you if you have heard of leo's toilet now you're going to hear me talk about leo's
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.320]   Toilet it's revolutionary
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.960]   There are no cameras on it. Don't worry. Everyone's always like, I don't need a iot toilet
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.520]   I don't need someone taking pictures. There are no cameras on the toto wash lit
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.640]   It has auto open and closed lid and a seat that's good. That's healthy for germs
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.000]   You don't want to touch stuff imagine walking in your bathroom and having the toilet seat
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Lid open to greet you and then close when you're finished completely hands-free avoid arguments about leaving the seat up when it automatically
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   closes for you
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   You will look back if you get the wash let you will look back and wonder how you ever got by without it
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:14.720]   Everyone needs that it's an electric bidet toilet seat. It was designed to provide a higher level of cleanliness and comfort
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.920]   Enjoy a comforting heated seat that feels like you just wrapped yourself in a towel straight out of the dryer
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.120]   Or you can turn this feature off entirely during the summer months
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   With a touch of a button a wand extends from under the seat for a soothing warm water cleanse
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.200]   The automatic deodorizer will circulate the surrounding air over a filter to neutralize odors
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.640]   Certain models even feature cutting edge technology that will keep your toilet clean including a pre-maced spray
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:47.600]   That will spritz your toilet before use and afterwards models with e-water plus electrolyzed water will spray your toilet bowl that do it for you
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.280]   Many washlets also feature additional advancements like a nightlight
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:57.840]   Remote controls also on-demand water heating means you never run out of warm water
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.560]   And don't forget that you will be reducing toilet paper and helping the environment
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.160]   It will be the newest and most popular small home appliance in the coming years
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.600]   You just wait and see everyone's gonna say that we saw it at Leo's house
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.120]   And we needed to get one of our own everyday more and more people are experiencing the clean revolution
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.240]   So it here's what you do if you if you're excited about this and I know you are

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:10.400]   All right, the best of 2018 according to apple is here. So they every year they rate apps. They rate podcasts movies
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.360]   They rate books
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   And audiobooks and it's interesting because the best book
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.040]   According to them was also the same best also the best audiobook. So what do we do?
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.600]   Do we read it on my books or do we listen to it? I don't know
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.720]   Their best book by the way was american marriage. Um, and it is a great great book. I highly recommend
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:35.600]   So let's see who wants to go first andy. What did you think of this year's list so far?
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.480]   Uh pretty good
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:46.000]   I kind of wish there was more stuff that nobody had ever heard of because like people have heard of black panther got a fair amount of press good for them
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.840]   But there's ways like little documentaries and little movies that
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.680]   Were part of some sort of of a package deal
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.800]   That just got just got added to just got added to the movie store
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   Um, I just it'd be such a great opportunity to make people get people to see their first ozu film
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:12.480]   Or to again something that is they're not gonna ever hear about unless somebody decides to put it on a featured page
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.880]   And also, it's really really great when you see all these
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.160]   It's it's it's it's a much bigger deal for the
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:29.040]   Highlighted apps than four movies because again if you if you're successful enough as a creator that you've got your movie for sale or for streaming anywhere
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.320]   You are so much further ahead
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.600]   Uh in getting your getting your vision out there than anybody else
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:42.000]   But the app developers that's still probably one of the few that that's still one of the very very few mass media
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.920]   Sort of kind of publishing where it really can be all the work of one person or two people
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:53.280]   So when you have one person who gets that surge of sales for december and suddenly they can they can afford butter instead of margarine
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.560]   In february, february, that's a really really big deal. So i'm glad they're doing this because this is people really do pay attention to this sort of stuff
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.160]   Was there anything on the list that anyone anything not on the list that people were upset about?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.320]   I mean besides this podcast obviously
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.440]   Totally
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.400]   I think you know, I'm amazed at how far pixel mator pro has come
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.080]   You know it from you know being like oh, it's pretty good to now
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:26.160]   I generally open it before I open photoshop and that's saying a lot because I I use photoshop for the last
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:32.640]   25 years or more and so but I'll open it up because it actually is faster
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.400]   Uh to do a lot of things and it looks nicer and more responsive
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.720]   And so I think that they've come a long way. It was good. I'm glad that they got the props here
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.000]   I
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.040]   Was glad to see that the app trend of the year is self care
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.920]   Because I'm always pushing the self care apps on ios today and leo always makes fun of me, but um
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.560]   That's how you live your best life with self care apps
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:58.640]   You put you put the oxygen mask on you first magan and then you help the children you put it on you first exactly
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.280]   Exactly
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.240]   Best self care
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.640]   I love that that procreate pocket
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.520]   Because the procreate for ipad has gotten so much attention, especially with apple pencil and you ipad pros
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.960]   But procreate on the iphone is just such a nifty implementation
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:20.240]   Especially considering the constraints of size and the limits of digital like you literally have to use your fingers
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.440]   To use it and they still james, uh kuda and his team just did such a fantastic job with it
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:32.800]   I also found it interesting that the best podcast of the year are so different than the most downloaded podcast of the year
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.440]   And like I get it that with apps it's often, you know, you look at the most downloaded apps and they're kind they can they can tend towards
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:48.080]   Garbagee more garbagee apps, but I always think of podcast as being um, you know more of the the best is going to rise
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.040]   To the top, but I guess maybe that's not true anymore like they're just very different
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.880]   I don't think anything on the best podcast nothing on the best podcast of the year was also on the most downloaded podcast of the year
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.720]   It's it's a hard it's a hard one to call because when you when they're endorsing a podcast
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:10.160]   They are implicitly released. I'm sure apple fields are implicitly endorsing all the content of that podcast
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:17.600]   So maybe they can't maybe they they are focusing on this is a when i'm looking at the list. There's not a whole lot of
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:23.920]   Uh, there's a lot of these are very very specific like a very fatal murder
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.080]   uh
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.680]   The this american life is is a constant, but again, it's a very very highly produced podcast serial is by its name
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.320]   Pretty much one story going on 99
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   Invisible is another one where you know exactly what this person is a high level of content year after year after year
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.400]   I think it would be a little it seems like it would be a little bit difficult on apple's part just to
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.480]   pick a
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.760]   To pick a podcast that might have a wider variety of content people who might be sometimes
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   Able to be very very angry with things
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.440]   and
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.520]   And flag it as something that is that wants to be one of these what 10
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.320]   Podcasts that they can put on put onto this list. I mean, it's this it's kind of
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.680]   Yeah, it's it's going going on and on and on about this about these these selections
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.000]   Like I said, I mean, they're they're they're they're good kind of sales guides. I don't know if they're
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.800]   the best at
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:26.400]   Helping people finds stuff that they wouldn't ordinarily find like drake as artists of the year
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.840]   I'm really really glad that drake and carty b are
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:36.720]   finally getting some attention maybe at on christmas christmas the when their their parents have the usual when even
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.600]   carty b going to give up this
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:46.240]   Failed music career and finally get a job at your uncle's lumberyard. He's offered you that that office manager job and kept it open for you
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:53.680]   It's like but there are other performers who really really need that shot in the arm both economically and also just spiritual
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.440]   Spiritual is the wrong word, but I don't know what where I actually mean here
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:05.360]   But the the idea that's sometimes it's nice to have some sort of external sign that hey people are noticing and people who are not me
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.320]   Are related to me or who owe me money are telling me that this is good and worthy of other people's attention
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.080]   It's interesting because I don't know if i'm stealing all of this from Alex from a previous show
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:20.240]   But there's been this sort of tension in the academy awards as well where it feels like they deliberately ignore the big successful movies
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.040]   For the smaller more art house movies
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:29.840]   Which are sometimes better but aren't always better and some people would want them to go all in like why can't black panther or infinity
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.000]   Awards be movie of the year, but instead they're gonna pick something you know obscure
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.600]   I have a list of why infinity wars can't be moved the year, but that's not the spot
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.400]   No, but you know, but the the well I would argue that was sir
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.320]   but Thanos is actor of the year is high up there for me as well, but
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.120]   But I think it's hard to sort of mash those like to to make sure that you are honoring everybody while
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.520]   Give me attention. I don't know if that needs extra categories or not
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.240]   And I really don't know if I just all this from Alex on a previous show
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.960]   Well, but the difference here is that with with the academy
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:06.000]   One of the reasons why it has a certain amount of integrity is that you've got 3 000 people
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.200]   That tends yes, mostly towards older white men
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.680]   But but all you can say is that these 3 000 people voted this way and it doesn't really point to a trend or anything
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:21.120]   But this is how they voted when you have something like the golden globes or apples best of 2018
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:29.040]   How is does where the academy doesn't control how who wins best picture
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:35.280]   It's always about how those 3 000 people choose to vote in that year with in reaction to that lineup of that year's releases
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:43.760]   How does whereas the apples best of 2018 can really be we have chosen that we want to spotlight these 10 movies these 10 CDs
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.240]   albums these 10 podcasts
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:53.920]   And so you don't know what the reasoning is. So that's why again, it's nice, but it's promotional rather than
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.720]   a celebration let's say
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.200]   So we don't know who picks these is it the is it the app store the editorial teams
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.960]   Uh for the different for the app store for the movie store. They have a group of editors for each of those divisions
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.280]   And they get together and work on them got it
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.960]   Well, it's interesting too because like the best iPad of the year is the frog apedia
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.880]   Which is the one where you dissect a frog and that one was like highly featured with the latest ipad or maybe last year's ipad
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.800]   I came in the keynotes. Yeah, maybe right squirm made me virtually squirm
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.440]   Yeah, so it's sort of like well that's surprising that you know, I like you know like Andy said
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.240]   I want to hear about something I haven't heard about already
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   Well, and I think that I think that apple
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.640]   whether with the frog apedia or or the
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   One of the things if you're a app developer
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.640]   I think it does help you if you look at where the apple's trying to take the platform and you build something that
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.800]   Really takes advantage of the new technologies and takes advantage of that. There's definitely something apple is looking for
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:56.320]   Uh, it doesn't mean that you're going to get something but if you you know, expend the energy and do something that's really
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.600]   Groundbreaking in in that direction. Of course, they're going to pay more attention to it
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.040]   And so I think that was a good example of really showing AR and education
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.520]   Which is definitely something that that apple is interested in and so and it was well executed
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.760]   I mean it doesn't help you if you do it and it's not well executed
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.240]   But it it was well executed and I think that I think it is good that beyond just the what's most popular that that apple is doing
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.040]   Some work to help take stuff that may be more creative and giving it a shot in the arm
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:29.040]   I know some developers who have said getting these kinds of recommendations from apple or showing up
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.600]   In an apple ad or showing up even on that front page when you show up is worth
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.240]   And just an incredible amount of revenue, you know, it just really makes a huge difference
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.440]   When apple kind when that kind of uh that that appears
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.200]   And so I do think that you know, it's a little opaque
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.920]   You don't really understand exactly what's going on there to make that work
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   But a lot of things like that are opaque
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:55.120]   So the raw charge though, I think the pure democracy of the raw charge does not necessarily
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.760]   The way we want to make all of our choices
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.200]   Okay, let's move on to the tenor
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.840]   Uh, I want to know is it is it selling or not?
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:09.760]   I feel like I cannot tell by reading the the headlines apple vp says it's the most best selling
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.320]   iPhone ever, but then of course, uh, mark bloomberg
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.520]   Mark german says you can call him mark bloomberg now
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.520]   Mark
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.080]   Mark mark
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.680]   The worst is this is we're never gonna know we're never gonna know whether it was the best
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.120]   Because they're not gonna tell us they're not you know, they've they've decided we're we've separated all of these out and we're not
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.320]   I mean, we're not gonna. No, but they never they never told you which device
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.280]   They never broke down numbers by specific sub they said iphone
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.400]   They never said which model but they will often tim cook will often say
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.480]   During the conference call like I think he said the seven plus for the first time outsold the seven
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.920]   And then he with the ten he said the ten was the most popular phone weekend workout
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.920]   And it's the first time since they split the line that the most expensive one had been the best seller
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.000]   And jos we act great jos we act who runs product marketing for apple said the iphone tenor
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.200]   Uh, it has been their best their best seller since launch so they won't give you the numbers or the percentages
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.560]   And it might be like I think Andy said on twitter might be they sold two instead of one
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:10.160]   Put them over the top, but you know, they when an officer of the company does say or you know, an executive
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.880]   The company does say those things. I think they're pretty safe to bet on
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:21.840]   Well, why I mean it feels like an important question to answer like are people buying the cheaper phone that is very similar to the more expensive phone
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.440]   Looks like
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:30.080]   I don't know if I were an analyst. I might have a different answer, but this is not something that affects consumers
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.800]   it's uh, it's
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.080]   Interesting the the only way we know how well something sold is
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:43.760]   Are they going to continue to make it next year do is there a brand new version of this wonderful peach colored plastic phone?
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.240]   The the exuberantly plastic phone they introduced what three or four years ago
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:53.200]   No, there is not which meant that the market just didn't apple didn't see a reason to continue it because people
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.920]   Worked it weren't voting with their wallets for it
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.560]   But otherwise there's so many reasons why so many people could want people to think that it's selling it incredibly well
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.320]   And other people who really want people to think that's not selling so incredibly well
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:13.700]   And that goes all the way down to part suppliers and so much business politics that I am glad i'm not a business analyst
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.220]   This is why i'm someone who goes up with cameras and six phones
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.580]   And that's what instead of like looking at spreadsheets and looking at projections of cost of parts and stuff like that
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.620]   And I think that I think that's hard
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:31.620]   The the x and the x and then now the xs, uh, you know have or the ten s have
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:36.420]   They they've taken some of the handcuffs off anytime you build a product you you have to decide okay
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.420]   I'm gonna I want all these I want this long list of features and all these cool things that we could add to it
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:46.020]   And then this is how much is going to cost to make it and and and you have to decide what that price point that target price point is
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:51.620]   What your target margin is what you're all those things have to be calculated and that limits what the designers can do
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:57.140]   And I think that one of the things that having a less expensive phone has allowed apple to do is take some of those limits off
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.900]   I mean they haven't taken all the limits off
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:04.180]   But but they have definitely taken a fair number of handcuffs off a number of shackles off of the
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:09.140]   iPhone development to allow them to kind of push the outer envelope of what they can do with the phone
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.420]   the r gives them that option of giving
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:18.020]   Letting people still have a lower cost one and the older the older phones
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:23.140]   Allow, you know folks to have you know has something that is still very very good
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:30.820]   But but you know allows them to keep on stretching forward with something that might be only what a handful of people
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:35.620]   And you know and I would expect they are to be what would sell the most as far as pure numbers go
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.620]   I don't know if it's going to be the the highest revenue generator, but it definitely
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.100]   You would expect it to be the in the meat of the of the of the development
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:49.860]   But it's hard to tell I mean I think that a lot of apple users are the ones that want the two lenses and want those other bits and pieces
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:54.180]   But I think that there's a pretty strong market for the folks that don't want to spend quite that much money on a phone
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:02:00.180]   There's something else too, which is interesting and apple doesn't always get the man forecasting right and it's a very tricky thing
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.060]   Like with the iPhone se they didn't make enough because they thought it would appeal to people who wanted less expensive phones
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.260]   They didn't realize how much it would it would appeal to people who wanted smaller phones
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:13.380]   So the market was roughly double what they thought it would be and now with the iPhone 10r
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:18.340]   Last year they were very careful to make an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 10 because they knew for some people
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.620]   It like despite how much the internet always says um boring
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.220]   You know if if the same thing looks the same way two years in a row
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:29.940]   A lot of people flying comfort in familiarity and they wanted people to be able to get a new iPhone with a new camera
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.860]   And a new processor that looked and worked the way their old one did and this year
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.980]   They didn't do that the new iPhones are only on the 10 stream
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   Which means like no no home button
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:42.580]   And there are some people who believe that the iPhone 8 is selling incredibly well now
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:49.300]   Because there are people who are ready to upgrade but they're still the iPhone 10 is still or the 10s and the 10r are still too alien to them
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:55.620]   And they find comfort in the home button and they can save even more money by going to an iPhone 8 from an iPhone 6s
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.940]   Or because most people don't change most people aren't like us nerds
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:02.660]   They don't change their phones every year so they're looking at it two years out and they're thinking you know, I understand this
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:07.300]   This is familiar to me. I'm going to get this and that might not be something that apple had in their demand forecast
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.420]   And they would have thought that people would choose between the 10s and the 10r and now a lot of people are also choosing
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:16.580]   Uh, there's a third candidate in this race and a lot of people are also choosing the 8
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:23.060]   But this stuff it just it happens every time and almost every time so far every single time it has been wrong
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:28.500]   It has been a blatant attempt between media and market manipulators to short the stock drive it down
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.460]   And just and literally cheat normal people out of their their money out of their apple stock
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.220]   And it's worked quarter after quarter, but there's been a lot more attention on it
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220]   So I don't know if they've ramped up
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.380]   They've ramped up the rhetoric in order to keep doing it because it makes so much money for them
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:50.420]   And we've sewn jim cramer before literally admitting to this on tape saying how he spreads a rumor and the apple publications are more than happy to run it
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.780]   And it it brings it drives the stock down and it makes his quarter for him
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.500]   And we've seen it happen over and over again last time it was the iPhone 10 wasn't selling turns out it was the best seller
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:02.820]   All the reports were wrong and this quarter they might be right absolutely possible they might be right
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.900]   But I think given the history you have to look at those with incredible skepticism every year
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.300]   And I don't think the reporting on it always reflects that
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.780]   Yeah, you're right
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.660]   Well, speaking of uh upgrading every year or not upgrading every year
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.220]   I I believe none of us need to upgrade
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:26.180]   Every year, uh, and if you have a battery that gets a cheaper upgrade the 29 dollar phone battery replacement that'll end
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.460]   At the end of december so get it while you still can uh december 31
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.740]   After that apple's going to charge 79. So any of you taking advantage of this for any of your yes
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:43.140]   That was you Renee. I yeah, I took I took my success and took my god kids two successes in
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.300]   I took everything in that I could take in
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.340]   And so you actually took them to an apple store you didn't ship away
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:48.580]   Yeah, yeah
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.980]   I signed up and I got yelled at for making one appointment for three phones that are three appointments for three phones
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.860]   And I said I was terribly sorry and they helped me fix it up and they gave me three separate appointments and took all the phones
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:04.420]   Went back very very contriately. I went back and and they fixed them up and they're all the 100 percent battery out now
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:10.100]   They are like three years old phones. Yeah, they're great for people like you and I who hand your phones down to people
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.020]   You know who don't you to younger people who can get a perfectly, you know
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.140]   They they will complain about the battery, but it's pretty easy to upgrade that
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.900]   Yeah
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.860]   Yeah, and the cost and how is it lower than cost so take advantage of it while you can and I think the program goes up
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:29.140]   It doesn't go up to eight yet. I think it goes up to success or seven already, but just take it in and have it checked
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.860]   I thought it was the se to the to the 10
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.380]   I don't think the 10 qualifies for the cheaper replacements though
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.980]   I think the 10 is 10 and eight have been moved to and people that upset about this
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:44.180]   They've been moved to part of the battery management, but they need so much less battery management than previous generations
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.900]   That I don't think anybody will notice even if they're on full-on
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.380]   performance control mode
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.820]   But I believe up to the seven and maybe the seven is only halfway but
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:06:02.500]   iPhone se iPhone 6 iPhone 6s all of those you can get and especially those they've gone through what 200 charging cycles by now
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.100]   Maybe more depending on how you use them. It's well worth getting the cheap battery replacement
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.140]   Yeah, and that's just a good opportunity to remind people that apple has so many different like
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.500]   exchange and repair extension programs you may not know about
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:21.300]   And I'll paste into the show notes, but I go to apple.com/support/exchange_repair
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.740]   Or just google for exchange and repair extension programs
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:30.100]   And like right here it says a 13 inch MacBook Pro non-touch bar solid state drive service program
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.700]   iPhone 10 display module replacement program for touch issues
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.620]   And even just stuff that's really really old and out of warranty
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:43.220]   It doesn't necessarily mean your phone is working fine take it in and we'll give you a new parts for whatever
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.780]   But sometimes it means that
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   Something that you thought was not worth bringing in for because oh I can't afford to have the whole screen replace
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.980]   Well, maybe there's there's a warranty extension program or like rene like we're talking about right now
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.500]   Maybe there's a program in place where they will do a free swap up because they've noticed
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.900]   They've got enough numbers back to know that this is a device wide issue as opposed to just
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.820]   A quirk of people so must have dropped it and they forgot about it because it kept working
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.140]   But they unintentionally caused some damage
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.340]   So it's always it's at any time that you've got
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.380]   At any kind of an issue with an apple device
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:20.660]   It's almost always worth making appointment in a genius bar because they have the master list of everything
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.580]   And you will off
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:28.420]   Shocked by how much they might wind up doing for you plus, you know, there's there's there's frozen yogurt stands at them all
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.460]   There are things you can do outside of as an excuse
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:36.500]   On twitter some people who have been talking about the 29 dollar exchange program
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:44.180]   Tell me about how their their iphone seven was kind of like old and decrepit and they broke like the glass or whatever
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:49.220]   And so they just gave them a brand new iphone seven because of course they didn't that's not their problem
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:55.220]   It's the geniuses problem and all kinds of things where they've got much more than just a 29 dollar battery out of it
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.300]   So the worst that can happen is that they will if you if you've got a problem with the device
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:03.940]   Like let's say i have a macbook pro that has a huge kernel panic because it has a bad ssd
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.780]   Even though you've been taking really really super great care of it since you bought it three years ago
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.860]   And now you don't know what you're gonna do if it can't get fixed
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:15.780]   It's worth taking it in just in case there is like a logic board program or something that you didn't know about and say oh actually
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.340]   I know it's three years old, but we can swap out the board for a nominal fee great do that then
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:28.580]   So I think I got the numbers slightly wrong scooter x is saying the 10 s the 10 s max and the 10 are
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:35.940]   Replace that's 69 dollars and all other eligible models are 79 so it costs more if you have a older phone
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:44.580]   That's I don't know if that it varies depending on it's only only it's only the phones that were initially subject to the performance throttling
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.980]   Are getting the super super cheap battery discounts previous phones and later phones?
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:54.820]   I I think apple is adjusted their prices across the board, but they do vary based on the model outside of those those brands
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   Those versions
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.460]   And I meant to mention okay there there we go
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.540]   after
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:07.060]   Replacements batteries will be will be priced at 49 dollars with the exception of the iPhone 10 apple
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.020]   What's hard 69 dollars for an iPhone 10 replacement?
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.340]   Got it
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.340]   That's not bad either. No
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:20.180]   It's not I'm a cheaper than a brand new phone better for the invite and also frankly if I could replace it myself
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.580]   I'm buying a kit for like 30 or 40 dollars
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.740]   I would myself I would probably say I'm not
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.060]   I'm not giving advice to people saying that if it were if it were my phone I were in that case
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:36.900]   I would very likely just say you know what why don't I just take it to it's it's it's kind of cost me if I were to pay myself
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.460]   Labor for this fix
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.580]   for ordering the parts getting them correctly doing a careful job and
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:47.940]   Being responsible for what happens. I'd much rather pay 30 bucks to another person who
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:51.140]   Particularly if that apple if it's an apple store that will say oh
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:59.620]   Turned out that I should not have been eating those hostess snowballs just before using creating your phone because now it's all filled with that
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.460]   With that filling in your board. So we're giving a brand new phone. We're sorry
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:09.540]   Whereas if I did that they would just have a good laugh and people would probably post the photos on instagram about hey look at this customer
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:18.340]   There's like all kinds of like like pink pink pink coconut shirts all of them under the glass and he wanted us to fix it for free
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:23.780]   There are many ways to be an instagram influencer and there you go. It could be as long as it gets those numbers up
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.100]   So you know if that if that
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:35.140]   If you have if instagram if youtube and instagram has taught us anything so long as you're you're you're you're an a-hole
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.140]   Who gets views and clicks?
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.940]   That fits into the business plan doesn't it?
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.940]   Well, I mean come back to what you were saying
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.460]   It does usually cost the same to like order a kit for my fix it and the battery then to take it to the apple store
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.900]   Not everybody has an apple store nearby and sending away your phone
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.460]   But yeah, I mean I think 2019 is my year of fixing stuff on my own
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:04.420]   Um, I had a set of christmas lights that went out. I was so they they went out and I didn't know why and I asked birk to help me
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.100]   And there was a fuse inside and he showed me how to replace the fuse and again
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.700]   This is something that I was like, oh, this is it's it's empowerment
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.060]   So when I was faced with my kids has a old iphone 6 he was complaining about the battery
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.340]   It's gonna cost the same to get a kit for my fix it or to take it to the local place
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:25.860]   Like to me it's worth more to get the kit and make him do it himself because you know
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.500]   It's a teachable moment and ownership that
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.460]   Teach about ownership that this is your phone which means that you know how to fix it and you're responsible for fixing it
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:39.220]   Right and then you can't or it'll teach you that or you'll it'll teach you that you probably should have done that because now you have to get a new phone
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:45.860]   That didn't happen. I'm so impressed though, Megan because my 2019 is my year of breaking things myself
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.300]   I haven't gotten to the point of the fix. Well send them to me and I'll fix them. I
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:55.540]   We all have to have resolution so that that's mine
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:12:00.740]   Um, because I just you know that there's too many phones in my drawer that could be used by someone else
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.220]   HTC cha cha
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.220]   Exactly. I did have that
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:10.260]   I um meant to talk about this when we were talking about the 10r, but is there no apple
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.820]   Case for the 10r
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:17.060]   No, it's like the twilight zone. It's like the the Bermuda triangle
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:23.940]   They were apple briefly mentioned on international versions of the press release that they would have a clear case available for the iphone 10r
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.660]   But people just expected them to have all the silicon and leather cases like they do for every iphone
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:33.380]   But nothing was available at launch still not available. There's been a dearth of
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   um
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.500]   dearth of third party stuff as well, which is bizarre too because
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.900]   typically they they're way they're way ahead. I mean they were the same sort of
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.500]   uh, dummies available
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:44.980]   uh
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.820]   Pre-launch for the iphone 10r that they're worth the 10s that are smuggled out of the plants and used to make early manufacturing
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.580]   Photolives for cases and we still don't see them and it's it's perplexing
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.020]   That really is. I don't understand. I feel like um
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:06.340]   I thought I saw it well like pat and quill is one of my favorites and they um thought they had a good 10r case, but they're pricey
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.060]   Um, I just can't believe why they would not have them yet
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:16.020]   Do you think it really is because they were hiding that uh hiding that phone style from people?
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:22.820]   Yeah, it was leaked like they they everyone on youtube had like a 10s 10s max and our model they were showing off months in advance
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:26.980]   So I don't I don't get it. This is the greatest mystery of all time
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:33.700]   It's what it is is they're behind the they're behind airpower and the manufacturing key and they're just sitting there tapping their foot
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.660]   Yeah, it's like when you're in drive-through waiting for the person with a really large order
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:42.100]   Just getting done by your neck one factory the factory that's doing the airpower and the factory that's doing the cases
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.820]   It turns out to be the same one it doesn't seem like that would fit together
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.740]   But maybe that's the case and the robots don't know how to move when I head of the other on the treadmill
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.820]   Yeah, that makes sense. Um, all right. So uh
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:59.540]   Let's uh, did you know that you can add uh, say an ad to your me moji has everyone done that already?
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.300]   I I might have instagrammed it. Oh, you did?
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:09.380]   Can we pull that up? How was that today? Uh, yesterday. Oh, um
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:16.020]   How did I not see that on instagram? Um, so pretty pretty easy to do. It's just in the hat section
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:22.100]   Yeah, it was hat was white which I think nobody noticed because it's been there since launch you've been able to do this literally since
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.100]   WWDC in june
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.660]   But because the hat was white nobody really paid attention to it and off season it was the wrong brand
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:33.620]   And then a couple people on twitter noticed that you can make it green for elf or you can make it red for santa
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:38.820]   And then immediately all the will farrell and uh, and you know like that the santa clause things had it happen
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:44.820]   And it was it's just great. It's just like one of those little easter eggs you stumble upon. Mm-hmm. Oh, there it is. That's good. Yeah
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.900]   Oh, yeah, whether outside was frightful, but my memoji was delightful
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:57.060]   Uh important additions to your memoji. Okay. Is there any apple news? I missed before we get to our picks
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.260]   Anything important that we need to talk about that I missed
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.860]   No
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   Remember, okay
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:10.180]   Tim cook is uh, is is is laying down the moral smackdown on everybody though me again?
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:16.660]   I mean that that's continuing he just got an honor and award and he's he's talking about the values of privacy and dignity and civil rights and
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:26.340]   That that's important. Um, I am a huge Tim cook fan. Um, and yeah, also, uh, they're the other big
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.340]   Uh
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:34.580]   Humanitarian news this week from apple is that uh to celebrate world AIDS day they announced how much money they were giving
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:42.180]   How much money they donated to product red and really interesting article in the apple news store about where that money is going to
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:50.580]   Um, it tells the story of some uh some women in an AIDS clinic and um, it's pretty amazing and also this week only I think if um
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:57.540]   If you buy anything from the apple store a dollar of that goes to product product red project and all the apple stores have the red logos up
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.540]   Again, which is nice to see this time of year
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:08.100]   Um, all right. Well, uh, I think we covered all all of the news. Um, oh scooter x says that their apple is on launching
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.620]   Online store with 10 discount for active military. Yeah
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:14.500]   So that's uh important too
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:20.660]   And whenever we really talk about this stuff everyone's like, well, it's you know, they could do more but of course
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.900]   But my big thing is just because everybody could do more all the time. You could do more
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.700]   I could do more everybody could do more. Let's start with doing something you inspired and then do more
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:35.620]   Exactly. Just because you can't do everything doesn't mean you should do nothing and uh, if every dollar from an apple store
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.020]   Uh purchase goes
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.420]   That's a lot of dollars. Yes. Yeah
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.780]   All right, encourage other companies to do the same thing and if they are encourage them to talk about it because it really does
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:49.620]   Inspire people to do more make it competitive. Let's see which company can do the most
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.180]   Yeah, I mean, it's been working with taking uh content off of their platforms
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.620]   Pretty competitive about that
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:03.460]   Also, we we can cite the little precedent of miracle on 34th street when whether the the macy santer
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.860]   Uh decided to create this program for uh making sure that people get the best deals everywhere
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.540]   Gimbals couldn't couldn't put up with that so even gimbals decided
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.460]   And then and then they're both challenging each other to donate more for for the old h home
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.580]   So there's there's ample there's ample precedent for this sort of
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:24.260]   And I think that we're gonna I think we're gonna see as social media becomes more important as it's harder to get advertising
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.780]   I think these kinds of initiatives are going to be more and more important for corporations
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.980]   They have to and it's not something they can do just around christmas. It's something that I think apple's doing more of since
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:37.380]   Tim cook took over. I think that we're gonna see that happening a lot more
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.660]   It's it's creating kind of a a reservoir of goodwill
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:47.780]   As my my father would say uh is that you you know being out there and making a difference in the community is going to
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:52.500]   Let you get over other bumps and I think that some corporations that are having a lot of trouble
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.580]   Haven't done a lot of that. Um and so when they have bad press it's hard to
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:58.820]   You know get that over because there's nothing there
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.100]   They're just seen as big corporations and when they when things go wrong
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.900]   They do not get the benefit of the doubt if you spend a lot of time
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:09.140]   Uh doing a lot of that outreach and making a big difference or making any difference
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.100]   Uh on an ongoing basis. I think you you start developing a relationship with the public
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:18.500]   Um that gives you a little room to to work if things aren't working out
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:24.180]   Exactly and a corporate responsibility in terms of environmentalism is also really important
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:27.220]   The big environmental report that sort of got lost on that friday
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:30.420]   After thanksgiving one of the things that said was that
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.460]   Whereas like maybe some of our government programs are hurting some of the advances
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:39.940]   Environmental advances that we've had corporations are picking up the slack a little bit
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.660]   In there and they could do more but they're doing a lot
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.300]   to
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.900]   Okay, uh
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.820]   We've got your picks get your picks ready. Um get them ready right now
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:57.700]   Though I want to thank the sponsor of this show rocket mortgage if you are in the market for a house
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.580]   Whether it be your first house or your 25th house
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:05.140]   Rocket mortgage will be there for you to take some of the anxiety
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:11.300]   Out of it. I know, uh, you don't have to feel anxious about buying a house. It is
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:15.220]   I mean, we'll just say it might be the most expensive thing you'll ever buy in your entire life
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.860]   But you don't have to feel anxious about it. There might be rising interest rates
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.340]   There might be unpredictability
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:27.300]   But rocket mortgage from quick and loans
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:33.860]   Will help they'll help ease that anxiety but they're they're calling it the power buying process
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.420]   So the power goes back to you and here's how it works
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:41.220]   First you just answer a few questions. They'll check your credit for pre-qualified approval
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:48.340]   And then they will verify your income your assets and your credit and it only takes less than 24 hours
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.700]   Sometimes even faster than 24 hours and they will give you verified approval
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.180]   Which gives you the strength of a cash
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:59.700]   Buyer if you've ever been if you've ever lost out on a house and and someone said well, they offered cash
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:04.100]   I always wonder like who are those people that can offer cash for a house in northern, California
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:10.340]   But now you can have the strength of a cash buyer. You can look just like the cash buyer once you're verified you qualify for their all new
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.100]   exclusive
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:17.940]   Rate shield approval first what they do is they lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.620]   That's three months
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:24.820]   You can have three months to shop around and find your perfect home and now here is the best part if rates go up
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.900]   Your rate will stay the same while you're shopping around your rate stays the same
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:32.180]   You don't have to feel rushed like I have to buy this house before my rates go up
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:36.740]   But if rates go down then your rate also drops either way
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:42.100]   You win you win this uh anxiety trap of buying house
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:46.020]   It's the kind of thinking you'd expect from america's largest mortgage lender
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:50.340]   If you want to get started if you're even if you even have an inkling of buying a home
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:54.260]   Even in the next year go to rocket mortgage.com slash mac break
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:21:00.900]   Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30 year purchase transactions additional conditions or exclusions may apply

[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:26.180]   All righty. I am going to say Alex goes first because his name comes first in the alphabet no
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:33.140]   So my my pick is actually something you can watch on your apple tv if you have Netflix, uh, it's called brainchild and
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:39.460]   brainchild is a I think it came out about a month ago and it is just a great example of
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.060]   I don't know where I think education should go. So it is uh, it's really designed for kids and science
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:49.940]   They've got a great host hosts are important and they've added a lot of production value
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.620]   Uh to it and so it's cut well. It's fast moving
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.220]   Uh, you know, I think that when we start talking when I talk about e learning
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:02.260]   Uh, and when I talk about those those things I think that this is what i'm talking about is trying to make it fun
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:07.460]   But dealing with a lot of the technical pieces of it getting, you know, kids excited about learning those things
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:12.500]   Uh, and it's um, you know, I don't know how many episodes I think they have seven or eight episodes that are that are out in this season
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:18.580]   And and I encourage people to go watch it even if you here's the thing is that this is the this could be something that
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.380]   Uh, really if this is one little step towards this this being successful on Netflix
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:28.020]   You know in more seasons being created and and them seeing this as a model is important
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.700]   So I want to make sure that people get out there and even if you just hit play and then go mow the lawn
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:35.700]   You know get some hours in there of it. Um, but definitely show it to your kids
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.140]   Um everybody that I've talked to I've I've been out of the house
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:44.100]   So if my kids haven't since I since I discovered that it was there so i'm going to be testing it on my kids here soon
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.220]   But um, they saw that they saw the trailer and they're they're pretty excited about it
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:49.940]   So I think they're probably going to be done with the season by the time I get home
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:54.500]   Um, but it's uh, it's it's got some great graphics in it. Um, it's a lot of fun
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:59.620]   And it's really what I think that you know, this is what I think lectures should be in in school
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:02.740]   And then we can have discussions, which is the classroom time with the teacher
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.620]   But I think that um, it'd be a lot better if we went through the subject a little bit faster with a lot more graphics and
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:14.100]   Have it be a lot more fun. So um, definitely check it out. It's called brainchild and it's on Netflix and it's um free if you've got a subscription
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:18.580]   Uh, what age kids would you say like your your age kids around?
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.340]   I think that you could watch it, you know into the early teens
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.180]   You know, I I'll watch it either way because it's fun to watch but I think that yeah
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:30.340]   I think that it's probably aimed at eight to 12 is is my guess what you know watching it?
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.060]   Is uh, it's that's probably the target audience
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:38.260]   But I think it's a lot of fun to watch either way. I think there's a lot of good science in there that that's fun to watch no matter
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:43.540]   What age you're you're at if you're an educator, I would definitely uh or someone who's building e-learning products
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:49.700]   I would definitely take note that it's kind of amazing when amazon applies that amazing amount of uh
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:54.660]   Of funds that they have towards creating high production quality education materials
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.220]   So it's uh, you know, it's it's a good model
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.460]   Uh, I don't know if everyone can afford to do it that way
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:04.900]   But it's it actually to me as a step up from even some of the stuff that we used to see, you know in nova
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.380]   Which I thought was nova was something I was always like I just wanted to be just like nova
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.740]   And then I went back and looked at nova and I was like my expectations are very low
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:18.420]   I can't it's gotten better, but I I uh, I looked at the older nova's that I used to use as reference
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.220]   And I was like, oh that wasn't that wasn't it was good for the time
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:25.620]   Uh, so this is a really um some really high quality
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:28.500]   You know content so I would definitely check it out
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.940]   Yeah, my kids uh, whenever they come up with some scientific fact
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   Uh that I check and it turns out to be true. I you know, I always ask them where did you learn that and it's almost always youtube
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.940]   It's very rarely school
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.540]   And that is but they do share that stuff in there
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:47.700]   Uh, I'm friendly with their teacher who's just like oh god your boys gave me 10 youtube videos
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.620]   I had to watch this weekend and make sure they're appropriate for class and you know, it's it's great, but I wonder the
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.580]   Um the high production value. I think part of
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:01.620]   What my kids like about the stuff that they see on youtube is the kind of you know
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.540]   It's just some dude in his garage. Um, who likes science as much as they do, you know
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:09.780]   It I think it can be I think that when we when we talk about covering those subjects though
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.060]   I mean there is a little love if you start designing it and really working through
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:17.700]   Uh, well designed well thought out high high quality graphics
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:24.180]   You can make it easier to understand what you're talking about and I think that they can support that that process effectively
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.740]   I think that they I'm sure that they like the other bits and pieces
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:31.620]   But I think that they also don't have a lot to to compare it to most of educational most educational videos
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:36.420]   And materials are pretty low low production values. So I think that it is a
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.780]   You know, be able to start seeing what good production value could look like
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:45.940]   It'd be interesting to have your kids look at it and and and and let you know whether they they think it's too shiny or something
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:51.620]   I think that there's room for both of those of we're gonna just get in there and hack away and you get to be part of it
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:54.020]   But I think that there's also understanding complex
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:01.220]   Microscopic or electricity or physics. I think that there's ways to complete understand these kind of complex
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:06.900]   um, uh, in a relationships that are hard if you don't use some graphics to draw it out
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:11.060]   And and to play it out and so that you can really understand what you're looking at and create context
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:14.580]   Um, but I think that then also those videos that are much more
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:20.820]   Uh rough around the edges or or um, are useful as well. So I I don't think that there I think there's room for both
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:30.100]   Yeah, I think um, they like mostly stuff that uh that gets set on fire like that if science involves things that are about to explode
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.220]   But unfortunately that you can't you can't do everything you can't set everything on fire. You know, that's the
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.940]   Hard to learn Alex. Well
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:43.860]   You haven't seen science videos on youtube. It's all it's it's because i'm a science video
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:47.540]   But it's always about what happens if you pour this thing on this other thing
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:52.420]   Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm learning. I I'm really glad there's
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.220]   I'm really glad youtube wasn't around when I was a kid. Yeah
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.820]   Well, they just spent their allowance on like a tesla coil thing
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.180]   Um, and I don't think it's gonna set on fire
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.940]   But it might like but they're really excited
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.580]   You know, they'll put the light bulb next to it and the light bulb lights up
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:13.460]   It's kind of like what they're they're creating their own wireless charging system in their bedroom. So
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.820]   Um, when they start talking about two million volts or one million
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:20.820]   You know the difference between half a million and two million votes and the in the length of the arc then uh,
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:25.220]   Then you know you're in trouble. They've realized that they need a lot of a lot of voltage
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:26.980]   to know
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:35.140]   Um, all right, and you come next in the alphabet. What's your pick today's lesson is the natural resistance of air as a medium for transmitting electricity
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:40.100]   Exactly. It's not a question of you can't transmit electricity through the air
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:43.940]   You just have to put a lot of it because it's a very very big resistor
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:48.340]   Uh two two picks that i'm really really happy about
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.820]   Uh, one is not necessarily tech related. I will take Alex's
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:57.540]   Uh bleed and say that because you can watch Netflix on a mac or an ipad
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:01.460]   Uh, the christmas chronicles with kurt russella santa on netflix
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:08.260]   Oh my god. This is like instantly one of my favorite christmas movies of all time and i'm going to be watching it every single year
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:11.060]   uh, this uh every it's uh
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.900]   Uh, you could tell the people who are writing this
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:20.500]   Really really love this gig and they've really decided to do a great job on it
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:26.740]   Is has none of the it's great because it doesn't have the usual cliches of a holiday movie particularly a holiday santa movie
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:32.820]   Uh, it's actually a really good story. It's modern without saying. Oh, santa
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:35.140]   You you have an apple watch
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.380]   Ho ho ho of course and I have everything now my list is now in the cloud
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:44.900]   Which is like, okay, fine. That's easy. Also, there aren't like farting elves and nobody gets hit gets hit in the nuts
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.660]   That's like those are the usual things you expect when they do let's do a modern
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.660]   A modern christmas santa clause story that will appeal to like everybody
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:57.940]   Uh, but this is also kurt russell is an amazing santa
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:06.980]   He's he's modern while still clearly being hundreds of years old if not centuries old the beard works the the the costume works
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:10.740]   The hair works if you don't get the santa right you don't got no movie
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.220]   Now, uh, i'm highest recommendation
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:19.060]   But one of the real reasons why i'm glad i get an opportunity to recommend it specifically is that i have to tell you
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.460]   the first 20 minutes
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:22.660]   Saaah
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.660]   Fuck with a capital sah
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.820]   It's terrible if not for the fact that a friend of mine recommended it highly to me
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:37.060]   I would have absolutely bailed because the first 20 minutes are strictly like lifetime made for tv christmas movie quality stuff
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:39.380]   Not as bad as the christmas shoes
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:43.700]   But you are if you see if you if you have survived a viewing of the christmas shoes
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:50.500]   You are right to be cautious and dump out of it just in case you're about to be walking into another christmas shoe situation
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:57.860]   So stick with it kurt russell shows up in about the first after about 20 minutes after that it's nothing but absolutely wonderful and
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.260]   Highest highest highest highest recommendation
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:05.460]   The other the other one is uh, it's also christmas related, but this is one is mac related
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:13.380]   Uh barebone software the maker of bb edit they're having their 25th anniversary year and they're closing out the year by opening the bb edit merchandise store
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:19.700]   So now you can get like be the classic bb edit t-shirts with the bb edit logo and the classic slogan
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:22.180]   Still doesn't suck
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:25.140]   You can get like uh, you can get the bags you can get
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:30.340]   Uh, sweatpants they have a brand new t-shirt, which I got a pre-release copy of
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:36.420]   Reinterpreting their one of their famous slogans as a rebus
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:42.260]   And I don't know if you can figure that i'm gonna give you the best the best chance possible by
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   Getting it there that's great. I don't know what's the first thing the first item is a still still
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:54.980]   Still saving why or still saving your
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.460]   Yeah
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.060]   Got it saving your donkey
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.100]   Yes, exactly saving your saving your pack animal
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:09.220]   Because you know we have a great time at the grand canyon, but do we ever think about the welfare of those poor animals?
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:13.060]   I do nothing but but shuttle american tourists up and down those paths or
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:18.500]   Fortunately the good people at bare bones software. No, it's I don't think any of this money is going towards any charity
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:24.340]   I think it's going to towards the charity of helping the people at bare bones continue to make really really great software
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.260]   Uh, so it's it's cool stuff
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:33.700]   I I predict that anybody at wwdc next year who is not have do who does not have something from this fashion collection
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.740]   Included as part of their clove at wardrobe for the week is definitely going to be not on trend
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.180]   So I've already they they sent they sent me the t-shirt
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:47.540]   But I'm buying like another t-shirt and a pin because I think I need a BB edit pin for bags and hats and stuff
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.220]   Love it rene. What's your pick?
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:58.740]   So I decided to go for it anyway, even though leo is not here and we cannot spend 10 minutes putting andy and Alex to sleep talking about it
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:04.980]   Pokemon announced their player versus player long awaited player versus player trainer battles
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:10.580]   Today I did a whole long video on it for people who are really in-depth interested in it
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:16.820]   But the gist is you'll be able to challenge anybody in person or your ultra or best friends over the internet
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:19.460]   You'll be able to battle up to three times a day for rewards
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:23.940]   You'll be able to battle the gym leader the team leader. Sorry for rewards. You can keep battling beyond that
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.900]   You just won't get rewards anymore, but it's just another thing
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:32.260]   They've added to the they've added to the game from weather to raids to the new gym system
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.820]   Uh to a lot of other things that even though I've been playing now for over two and a half years
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.900]   And I've done almost everything that you can do
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.820]   They just keep adding more and more stuff to it and they do it in a way that is
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:49.860]   That is like a fitness focus like you get you get rewards now one of the latest editions is the more you walk every week
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:55.460]   The more the more bonus stuff you get so if you pass, I think it's five kilometers 20 kilometers 50 kilometers
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:33:01.060]   I was at 49.8 last week's I was really bummed. I got to get to it you get more stuff
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:04.100]   And also now they're trying to promote a lot more social interaction
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.100]   So it's not just learn about your neighborhood
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.940]   But actually you know talk to your neighbors
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:11.460]   And I know it kind of sucks that we have to have a game and gamification
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:16.660]   To make us do that in our post industrial now post maybe information age
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:22.500]   But if not that then what if not now then when so i'm taking i'm taking everything that they will give me
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.220]   It has it hasn't shipped yet. It was just announced today could ship as early as next week
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:30.100]   I think they probably want to get all the bugs squashed before they roll it out
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:33.620]   But it should be a lot of fun and just in time for the holidays
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:38.900]   So I walk around a lot do I have to have the pokemon app out?
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.940]   Um, no, so they added this
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.180]   I'm ready. Rusa is right there, but I have no balls
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.500]   Uh, you can get yeah
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.300]   Well, I mean just spin some stops and then you'll you'll get some more balls
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:52.340]   But they added something called health sink a two or three weeks ago
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:58.980]   Where you can connect it to android health or health kit the health app on ios and then it'll just be use the built-in
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:04.580]   Um, sensor fusion hub on your phone to sort of track how far you've gotten how many steps you've taken
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:10.020]   And give you credit for them even though you're not in the game and it'll even let you hatch eggs and do other in-game stuff
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.620]   Uh, while and i've got the the pokemon ball that I suggested last week
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:18.980]   For uh for the nintendo switch and you can set that up and it'll it'll spin the stops for you while you're out too
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.140]   So instead of having your head down looking at a phone
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.020]   I'm just walking around enjoying nature and it's just giving me treats along the way, which is great
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:34.900]   Um, I have two quick picks one is um, I didn't put this in the dock. I guess you can't really see my screen. Can you?
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.940]   Um, uh, carsten. Oh, there we go
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:46.500]   Uh, it's the this is the test the joy tech music tesla coil arc plasma loud speaker wireless transmission experiment desktop toy
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:50.340]   And the reason why I show this is not necessarily that you should go out and buy this one
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:54.660]   But i'm pretty i feel that my kids overpaid for this that's $69.99
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:59.220]   $70 but when your kids save their money and they want to buy what you think might, you know
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:07.060]   Have only three customer reviews. So really if anyone has another tesla coil that would work that would be less than $70
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.660]   That, um email me at megan at twit.tv
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:16.500]   Um, so just just just make sure you have that conversation with your kids first that some toys are okay to lick
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.100]   Some other toys are only okay to lick sometimes
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.620]   So what would happen if i'm sure they've already licked it like what
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   They're 13
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.580]   Um, what happened to you?
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:31.220]   Set your tongue on fire just heard a little
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:38.660]   I've never tried I did I did stick a key into a power outlet when I was five years old. Uh, it wasn't terribly unpleasant
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.060]   I though you know, it didn't kill me at all could have
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.780]   Uh, but uh, I that that basically taught me to again some
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.220]   Electricity is meant to be played with some electricity
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:53.860]   Like a tesla coil perhaps i'm not gonna let someone else tell me whether you can lick one or not
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:55.940]   Okay, that is the biggest question
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:02.020]   Why uh where the airpower is why there's no, uh, tan r case and can you lick a tesla coil
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:07.140]   And my uh, my final pick is the lyric section on apple music. Um
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:13.620]   Which I recently used because I don't know if you guys have read the lyrics recently to baby. It's cold outside the song
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.340]   Um one of my children going in
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:22.500]   Out that it's kind of um, you can't really see unfortunately, but all the songs have lyrics, right?
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:28.580]   You know if you open them up and they uh, I don't mean to um, bad mouth lf. It's here because she's one of my favorites, but um
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.620]   Yeah, it is a little bit. Um
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.420]   Shall we say?
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   As my son pointed out, it sounded a little rapey
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:41.860]   So, um, I tweeted this out got a lot of responses people like I never listened to that and then a lot of people saying
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.540]   Well at that time it was just uh, a woman
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.900]   That a woman was never allowed to stay out late. She was always seen
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:54.180]   Uh as um, you know, she had to always go home and it was just her trying she really wanted to stay so
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:59.860]   I just want to you know, it's up to you to decide. Um none of you are commenting and that's okay. No, no, no, I'm saying
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:03.060]   Okay, go ahead. Again. It's uh, it was uh, a friend of mine
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:14.820]   A friend of mine posted on the blog a the original version of this which was written kind of like as a party piece for the composer and his wife or maybe their co composers
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:20.100]   That was so popular that like they would get invited to parties just to sing this duet together
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.700]   Uh, and it's exactly as uh as you were told that it was like
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:26.820]   Uh, I have to I have to be I have to have an excuse
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:33.620]   You say oh why why was when you when you when you go back to your apartment and the house mother is asking why would you why did you come home?
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:40.420]   Oh, it was it was so cold and so snowy outside that I it was just unsafe. I felt unsafe
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:45.780]   That's why I stayed until out until past 10 p.m. Last night with that date that I was on
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.780]   So yeah, but it does one one of the things that's kind of interesting about
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.180]   New understanding is that
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.780]   Intent is
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:38:00.580]   Not as big of a factor as people crack it up to be doesn't matter that this was written at a time where it met something totally different
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:04.100]   The intent was certainly not hey, I'm about to commit a crime here
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:09.220]   Uh, but the fact that it's now 2018 and people are going to hear it much much differently
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:13.860]   It doesn't make it a bad song. It doesn't necessarily mean that everybody should ban it
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.860]   But it does mean that some people are going to think
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:21.860]   Maybe it's a good idea for us to take this off the playlist because again the intentions of
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.540]   Speech
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:28.500]   Are not the entire story. It's how it's the effect that they have on the listener
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:33.940]   That has to be really really thought of it's not not the not the old not the only part of the discussion
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.980]   But the fact that oh well, this is this was not written that way
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:40.020]   That doesn't end the discussion. It's how people are listening to it
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:44.020]   If you're if you're having a bunch of people over for christmas for a christmas party
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:47.780]   And you don't want a discussion about it then don't put it in the list
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:52.980]   If you want a discussion about it then throw it right in there and maybe have it come up every 10 songs
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:58.020]   You know and and you eventually someone's going to realize between their eggnogs that you're playing this song and then no
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:00.980]   Then the uh, it's the family christmas everybody
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.380]   I would not I would not know. I would just say it's not like it's it's not like
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:09.620]   It's not like the pippy lapu cartoons and Warner brothers where now
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.140]   I
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.380]   I didn't I didn't think twice about it when I was a little kid watching it on saturday mornings
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.460]   They're still really funny, but yeah, it really is about a guy
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:26.900]   Trying to mash on a lady who is throwing every sign whatsoever that she would rather be left alone and perhaps
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.300]   For that reason
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:33.860]   There's so many things that we watched that we watched that were just horrible
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.860]   People like I was in the cartoons
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:41.700]   Well, I was like I was like, oh, so like why don't any why doesn't anybody uh play johnny quest on tv anymore?
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.900]   Because I love johnny quest. I mean that was like my that was my show
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:50.980]   You know, it was all you know, it was it was geeky and it was whatever and I uh and I went ahead and got some of them on
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:55.940]   On, uh, I think on iTunes or whatever and and I watched it and I was like, oh, I can't what I can't show this to my kids
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.740]   Right
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:02.420]   Funny they're they're reboot or they're launching it. It's good on youtube
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.060]   There's a new series of like popeye cartoons
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:10.180]   Uh, and so you can't and so I could see the the fact that okay
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:14.340]   You can't have like the original like 1920s 30s version where he's always got a pipe in his mouth
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:20.660]   But now they have just for no particular reason to always walking around with a whistle in his on the corner of his mouth
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:22.900]   That's like kind of like the shape of a pipe
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.060]   Maybe it's a rape whistle
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.060]   Oh, you brought that all the way back around
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:36.020]   That's a professional keeping it on message. Yeah, yes
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:42.820]   Um, well, thank you guys. It's lovely to have this discussion with you and um, you know, I go

[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:59.620]   Sometimes side by side sometimes one and the other because i wanted a better sense of what the upgrade cycle looked for somebody who actually didn't work in tech
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:04.020]   And didn't have the massive problem of upgrading from a ten to a ten r every year
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.900]   So i have a video on that hopefully up tomorrow
