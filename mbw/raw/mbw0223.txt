[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, here he is in studio with us, Mr. Alex
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.160]   Lindsey, fresh from his arrest by four CHP officers.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.480]   No, you weren't arrested.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.240]   I wasn't arrested.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.360]   They were escorting you.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960]   Yes, they were escorting me to the prison.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.640]   No, no.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.400]   We were doing a camera shoot.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.480]   So we did live streams on Saturday and Sunday,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.400]   one from a camera car and another one from a studio
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.240]   through the live U-Box.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760]   But we were watching it this time.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.480]   We were watching it.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.080]   It was so cool.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.760]   It was really fun.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.880]   We had two witness cameras attached to Kelly's
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.000]   all-in-one truck as a big camera car.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.120]   And so we had them going into an HS2000, which
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   is a data video mixer.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.560]   And then that was running into the live stream.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.600]   And then we were streaming that live.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480]   And people saw cops.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.880]   So if you're shooting and you want
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   to stay within the parameters of the law in most locations,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.400]   you need to get a police escort to make sure
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.240]   that you don't hit somebody else's car with a jib.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.960]   Makes sense.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.280]   It's the little things in life.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.840]   So we hired four cop cars.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.800]   You need to.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040]   But the chat room didn't know that ahead of time.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.920]   So I'm watching it in the chat room.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920]   And we're doing another show.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   He's getting arrested.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.320]   And they said, oh my god, he's getting arrested.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.840]   Because we didn't have any audio.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.480]   And then I saw the next day I was watching,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120]   well, beautiful jib shot in the studio.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.400]   That was gorgeous.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.040]   We really were doing more and more of these streams.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.360]   And we're having so much fun with them.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.400]   Pixelcore.com.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.480]   But follow either @pixelcore or @alexlindsey.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.760]   And you'll tweet when they're shot.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.720]   And right now, because it's still kind of really cutting edge
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   for us to be doing this, we're kind of telling people
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.800]   like a half an hour before we're doing it,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   or right before we're doing it.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.160]   Hey, we're turning the cameras on.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   Eventually, as we go into next spring, especially
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   because we get the new studio area,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.120]   we'll be giving people a lot more warning
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.200]   that we're streaming live shoots.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800]   But right now, you just kind of have to follow us on Twitter.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.440]   And then we'll tell you what's happening.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   Yeah, it's really fun.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.800]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.360]   Also with us today, really glad to have him back.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.040]   Mr. Ray Maxwell, formerly of Maxwell's house.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.640]   He's our resident expert on anything and everything.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.400]   Aye, Leo.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.160]   It's good to have you Ray from Vancouver.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.200]   And you're bundled up.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.280]   So I suspect it's a little chilly now.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.040]   And the 3-1-worse.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.080]   We had record lows in November.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   We got down to minus six Celsius.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080]   Wow.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.600]   That's cold.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.520]   Which is really unusual for Vancouver.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.840]   Yeah, that's chilly.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.520]   Well, great to have you back.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.680]   Ray, also with us from--
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   I imagine it's a little chilly in Dedham right now.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.080]   Andy-- not Dedham.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   That's where Paul Thorade is.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.600]   But Dedham area.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.680]   Andy and I go.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.720]   Dedham adjacent is what we call it.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.600]   From people who can't afford to live in Dedham, Massachusetts.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.960]   Well, we can dream.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.640]   And we can scrub the toilets of those
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:17.280]   who work in Dedham and afford to live in
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.480]   No pepper ball in this part.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.980]   That's called The Whip, when they do that in the television.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.560]   You know I haven't really been following the Mac News.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   Anything happen lately.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.380]   I'll tell you one thing.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.720]   The iPad got eclipsed as the most adopted consumer electronics device of all time.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.080]   Can you guys guess what new consumer electronics device sold more in its first months than
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.740]   the iPad with be the Xbox or the Connecticut Kinect?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.740]   I'm I'm I'm.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.460]   I can't say it because it's a gift for somebody, but I'm getting one.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.460]   Not for me.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   It's pretty fun.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.460]   I don't know.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.280]   I still don't know if it's got if it's got that we issue where you it's really cool at
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.200]   first and then you kind of get tired of it.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Right.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.880]   But it's pretty fun to play.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.520]   I've talked to folks in the Xbox team at Microsoft and that's they're different from
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   the normal Microsoft people like you'll talk to somebody.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   Because they not only do they have great ideas, but they actually do things with them and
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.400]   they know what they're going to be doing with them a year from now.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.440]   They don't just do the one demo.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.060]   And so I haven't reviewed it yet because I'm saving it for I'm pretty sure that pretty
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.260]   soon there's going to be that you're going to be able to do more than just a box with
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.260]   it.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.560]   I think they're going to really try to make use of to elevate the Xbox from a game console
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.260]   with certain like home computer features to a really interesting way of interacting with
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.260]   the computer.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.780]   Not to make this the Microsoft show, but that there is that rumor going around now.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.860]   TechCrunch has it this morning that Microsoft is working with on deals to make it a television
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.860]   device.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.600]   I just feel like in five years from now or maybe 10 years from now they're going to
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   go.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.280]   Yeah, that company used to make they used to make the software for PC.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   What's an opera assistant daddy?
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   Well, good good on.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   I'm saying read.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.260]   I've got the I think the new phone is is is pretty competitive.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.480]   I think the connect is obviously competitive.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.200]   Two and a half million units sold on the fourth first month.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.880]   Not that the iPad is not hugely successful.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.720]   In fact, Cyber Monday yesterday.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.620]   I don't have the numbers in yet, but the stories are the very strong sales.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.500]   I think that they're saying that the iPad right now is averaging out at 1.2 million
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   units a month.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   That's what I read.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.740]   So we're going to get very close to 10 million for the end of the by the end.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.820]   And let's point out that that was really an unknown product.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.140]   In fact, if anything, the only thing we knew about tablet computing was it was a flop.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.860]   It had been a flop for a decade.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.700]   So you know, I remember Gruber and others speculating, well, there must be some secret
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.180]   sauce in here because there's no way that tablets going to going to be worth apple
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.960]   putting any energy into it.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.560]   And here we are in still it.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.080]   Still in the first year for a few more months of the of the idea.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   We have to look back.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   I think we made predictions.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.400]   I don't even what my prediction was.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.880]   I had a your bet.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.720]   I had a bet with the John C. Devorek that it would sell in the first 12 months, five
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   million units.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.520]   And I think a lot of people thought that was very bullish.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.320]   I think mine was like eight points.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.480]   I think you were in the eight's.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   I don't remember what Andy said, but I was little.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   I was under five.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   I didn't.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.680]   I thought that it was going to be like the Mac 128 where it would definitely establish
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.660]   a beachhead that you could launch the 2011 invasion off of.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.740]   But I didn't think it would be selling 10 million.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740]   Boy, was I wrong.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740]   Yeah, amazing.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.920]   I mean, really a success.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.680]   We all were under even the extremely bullish 8.8 million.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   Yep.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   Was low.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.480]   Well, it has it has completely changed my reading habits.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   I mean, I I am now.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.180]   Were you a kindle guy in Ray before?
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.780]   No, well, remember Kindle was late coming to Canada.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.780]   Right.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.920]   And so I had the iPad by the time Kindle came to Canada.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   So I got the Kindle app on the iPad and I have to say, I love it.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.280]   I mean, I read a lot and chapters bookstore that's just two blocks from me doesn't see
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.680]   me very often anymore.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.160]   Yeah, I won't buy paper anymore.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.320]   No more paper, no more plastic.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.840]   You use Kindle, right?
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   I use Kindle on the iPad.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   I don't use a Kindle.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.360]   Well, I use where Kindle has a real advantage because you can buy it on one on all the devices.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.920]   You don't have to buy multiple copies of a book.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.360]   I mean, what I found is a lot of the technical manuals because some of the companies haven't
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.000]   been able to sort out their rights issues with Apple or their sales issues with Apple
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.240]   that a lot of the technical manuals that I want are only available on the Kindle and
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.040]   not available on the iBook store.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   So I'm still buying stuff on Kindle and it's mostly technical manuals.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.160]   I don't even consider the iBook store because if it's available on the Kindle, I'm going
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   to buy it on the iPad.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.680]   Well, I think that it's a much better experience.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.880]   I have a couple of really like the iBook better.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   Andy, it's a better software.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   I enjoy the reading experience better than that.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.720]   I enjoy the note taking experience better than that.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.960]   I do wish though that iBooks are available on more devices though because I think...
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.760]   Actually, the biggest limitation is though, is that if there's a book that's out that
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.440]   I've heard of, chances are about 10 times better than I'm going to find it on the Kindle
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.160]   store than on the iBook store.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.240]   So that's the first place I look but I will almost always wind up buying it on Amazon.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:02.320]   The other big plus there is if you buy it on the Kindle and you buy a new device, it
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.640]   moves with you.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   Right.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.360]   And I find that...
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.120]   I don't know when this actually happened because for a long time I didn't think I could really
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.000]   view PDFs very well.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.520]   When it first came out with the iBook with iBooks and now if I'm in Safari and I download
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.240]   a PDF, I can say view it in iBooks and it just immediately puts it into that library
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.240]   automatically.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.440]   Which is what I do when we do in production, I make sure that the iPad has all manuals
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.560]   for every piece of hardware that we have.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.040]   Which is that's changed the entire reality of what we own.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.280]   I've been playing with Ruby and Ruby on Rails learning.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.880]   I've learned it before but re-learning again.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.520]   And I had a lot of old Ruby in Rails books and Ruby and Rails are both of them updated
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   considerably.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.000]   I didn't even consider buying them in hardcover or paperback.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.960]   I just wrote right to the Kindle store.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   Almost all of them are available.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.640]   And it turns out that's a great way to do is put it on the iPad next to your Mac.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.440]   I mean it's a good way to do technical.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   I still like to be honest, listen to Audible, I'll prefer to actually listen Audible and
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.200]   read but if the book is not available on Audible, then Kindle, then paper.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.600]   For me, fiction is movies for me.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   Nonfiction is Audible and technical is Kindle.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   That's how I view my stuff.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.000]   Apple stores on Black Friday sold 8.8 tablets per hour.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.680]   Each store.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   Each store.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.360]   8.8 per minute or per hour.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   No, no.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   Each store.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   Oh, each store.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   Okay, store.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.920]   You can't sell eight tablets a minute in a store.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   You can in the San Francisco store.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.600]   Yeah, you might be able to.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   Places packed.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.120]   Also, according to, this is to Gene Munster, Piper Jeffery analyst.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.840]   He said his team's watched Apple retailers for seven hours and came away with this conclusion.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.720]   This is an interesting statement and you know, these guys are looking for that, you know,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   soundbite.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.200]   The Mac, the iPad is the Mac of the masses.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   It's a good soundbite.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.000]   I don't know what it means.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.120]   Yeah, no, that's something that I thought of a few months ago because I realized that
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.720]   I realized that a few pictures.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.960]   Okay, I got a picture in my iPhone roll that's dated because I was writing a piece of fire
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.400]   and I was at the pizza place that I often set up shop at first first lesson to people
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.200]   who are in like food retail.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.480]   If you open up a pizza place and the pizza is good and the there's unlimited drink refills,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   don't add free Wi-Fi because you're going to lose tables.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.320]   You know, there's going to be this guy.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   Exactly.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.400]   I'll buy my two slices and then I'm there for four hours.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.120]   But anyway, so I was there and I had my iPad on the little Griffith stand.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.160]   I had my Bluetooth keyboard and I'm actually doing real work on it.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.000]   I suddenly like look at it and I realized that what does this resemble more than a 128K
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.080]   Mac with that little like that form factor, the one that's good point.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.280]   But the same size, I wound up like downloading a picture of like the original Mac 128 Hello
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.720]   promo pick and putting that on the screen and then just take a picture because it just
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.120]   reminded me so much of you.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.160]   This is also also when you think about the original goals of the Mac that was supposed
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.400]   to be a computer that everybody could afford that would cost way, way, way, way, way less
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.760]   than a thousand dollars.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.200]   The priorities that Steve Jobs put on it were going to be that, okay, it's not going to
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.440]   matter that we can't expand it.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   It's not going to matter.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.560]   There's not a whole lot of apps for it because this is a sort of device we're trying to make.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.280]   And so they've succeeded in making for most people, throw in, you know, a hundred bucks
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.640]   for the keyboard and an easel.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.720]   Now they've built a $600 to $1,000 computer that doesn't run every app out there but doesn't
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   have to.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.120]   And once you buy it, that's pretty much all you're going to do with it.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.040]   But it's making a lot of people like me really, really happy.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   That's the goal.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.240]   Twenty years later, twenty-five years later.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   We finally met it.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   I actually said that.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.480]   I'll take credit for that.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.280]   I said that Leo LePort said that.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.200]   I remember sitting in front of the Apple announcement of the iPad and said, "This is
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.000]   the computer Steve Jobs always wanted to make."
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   If he could have made this instead of Mac 128, this is what he would have made because it
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   is.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   It's the computer for the masses.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   It's very easy.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:09.200]   I actually would retract that today because while it is a great accessible computer, it's
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:16.320]   quite a replacement for a computer.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.880]   I think it depends on who they are.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.120]   Of course it depends on who.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   But it's not a full replacement for computers, my point.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   No, I don't think so.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.760]   But I do think, yeah, I look at the way my...
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.560]   So if they had made this instead of the Mac in 1984...
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.280]   It would have changed the computer.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.840]   It would have changed things and I don't know if it would have changed things for the
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   better.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   No, it would have been...
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]   This is an accessory.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.800]   Well, remember what the world was like in 1984.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.680]   I mean, first of all, Reagan was president, so everything's going to stink.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   Second thing though.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   There we go.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.680]   Hello.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.880]   See, I thought that we get a little peppa ball.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   San Diego letters.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.440]   And then I'd go.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   From sea to shining sea.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.200]   But yeah, I mean, at least they can look at the most of all in which you really...
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.640]   Your entire computing world was there on your desktop.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.320]   If you did not have it there on your desk with you, you could not do it.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.280]   And the rest, the iPad can do what it does and do it so inexpensively because it can
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.400]   live off of getting things off the internet and having an app store that's elsewhere that
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.600]   you don't have to really find some guy who'll mail you a cassette tape and a pad and envelope.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.200]   So yeah, something like this would never work.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Remember that for 20...
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.480]   When was the first time that you heard about like Elson or other people trying to develop
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.640]   like network computers?
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.640]   These thin computers that do nothing but run apps that are hosted by a remote server,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.320]   none of them were able to work, chiefly because again, you needed to have everything there
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   on the table with you.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.880]   Well, I am thinking about an iPad for my wife because she's due to replace her computer.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.480]   She has a very old eMac.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.120]   And I'm saying, you know, you got to get a new computer.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.800]   It's a power PC.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.680]   It's really out of date.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.120]   And rather than get an iMac, I have considered because all she does is browsing on the web
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.680]   and email.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:11.440]   If I get her an external Bluetooth keyboard so she can compose things, it really does almost
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.200]   everything she wants to do.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.800]   My wife's parents, she was like, "Oh, she's thinking about getting an iPad and then she
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.080]   wasn't sure if she wanted to get an iPad because she was looking at the way her parents used
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   it."
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.640]   She goes, "Well, they got files everywhere."
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.680]   All they do is text documents and surf the web.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.520]   And I was like, "That's the perfect person to have an iPad.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.400]   It's going to put your files, keep your files from getting all messy because they're all
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.000]   going to go into one little place."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.120]   And all you're doing is making files.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.440]   I thought that too with my wife because she doesn't know that there's a desktop.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.000]   Remember I told you, I closed some of the apps and she said, "What's that?"
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.560]   I said, "Well, that's your desktop."
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   She said, "What are all those things?"
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.120]   I said, "Well, those are all the things you've saved under the desktop."
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   She said, "Oh, she doesn't want a file system.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   She doesn't need a file system."
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   Now interesting, I got her an iPad.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   No interest in the iPad.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.320]   She's still using the 13-inch MacBook.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.200]   So I guess I don't know.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   She likes a keyboard.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   But there you go.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   Go ahead.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:12.480]   One thing that was interesting to me, this is the week earlier today that I packed up
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.760]   like the finally Apple's 11-inch MacBook Air.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   And it kind of maybe modified some of the things I've been saying about the iPad a little
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   bit.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.000]   I know now that a lot of it was just the simple fact that it's a powerful computer that's
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.760]   really light and really thin.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.520]   Because I did find that I was leaving the house without my iPad a lot more frequently
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.120]   over the past month than I had when I didn't have that nice tiny little 11-inch MacBook
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   Air handy.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.160]   Now, to be fair, there are more instances which I was leaving the house with both the
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   MacBook Air and the iPad because the iPad will always be my book reader and always be
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   my "I'm on the train.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.400]   I want to read something or do something while I'm in transit from someplace."
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   But let's not discount the...
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.240]   But I really had to make... it really was an illustration for me that a lot of it wasn't
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   really the technology.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   It really wasn't the multi-touch.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.720]   It was the simple fact that we finally have a computer that's this thin and this light
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.920]   that you can just take with you that runs the Mac OS whether you want it or not.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.120]   I think it's interesting though, I do think there's a before and after there.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.080]   I mean, because I...
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.720]   As a person who owns an iPad, I keep on looking at that at the Air, which is one of the few
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.200]   Mac, a few Apple products I haven't bought.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.640]   And while I'm really excited about it, I have a 13-inch, so I already have something
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   kind of small and I have an iPad, I've got a couple of those.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.200]   And I'm just kind of like, "Oh, do I really need another computer?"
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   That's small.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.080]   It's not hefty that has 17 inches or something like that.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.920]   So I do think if you have an iPad, I think that they are very close.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.120]   I think the 11-inch and the iPad are in this very close realm where they're...
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.440]   I think if I didn't have the iPad, I would definitely buy the 11-inch.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:52.680]   A close friend of mine just got a MacBook Air, the new one for his wife, who's a lawyer
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.520]   and uses her computer very heavily.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.360]   And she had the old MacBook Air and the new one with the SSD drive, he says, is night
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   and day that the...
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.580]   While it may not have that high of CPU power, he said your experience is just lightning
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   fast.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.400]   Yeah, it turns out that's not the CPU.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   It's the I/O that really makes a difference.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Right.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And they love it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.880]   She just thinks it's fantastic.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.600]   Oh, I'm deeply, powerfully and emotionally.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.080]   I'm trying not to touch the O's very often.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   I don't want to open it.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   I don't really want to feel it.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   I don't want to know anything about it.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   I don't want to taste it now.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   I was going to taste it.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.600]   I was going to lick it, but now that Leo's licked it.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.600]   It's like licking someone's candy bar.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   I mean, you know, once it's been lit...
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.280]   Why do you think I licked it?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   I'm going to do other things too.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.920]   Then you'll never touch it.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   No, no.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.320]   It's interesting that Munster and his minions actually just sat in Apple stores with little
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   checkbooks.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.520]   I'm surprised the Apple stores let them go.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   There goes another one.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   There goes another one.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   Seven hours.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   There goes another one.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.200]   So 8.8 iPads an hour, 8.2 max in general an hour.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   Now this is per store.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.800]   How many Apple stores are there?
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   A thousand?
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   I don't know.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   How many?
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   There are quite a few.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.720]   That's a lot of max and a lot of iPads, a little bit more iPads.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.280]   He says, "Despite comments that, quote, the 11-inch MacBook Air has been flying off the
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.920]   shelves, max sales were down compared to the same thing that he did last year."
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.560]   He said Apple retailers sold...
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.080]   Oh, see, I think this is well within the margin of error.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.040]   Instead of 8.2 max an hour, 8.3 max.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Yeah, that's no way.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   No.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   Come on.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   What do you think this is?
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   A science?
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.000]   Apple will eventually release some numbers.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.160]   Sometimes they actually tell you exactly what they did over Black Friday, for instance.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   Do you think the price cuts...
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.080]   I mean, they've always been a Nemic.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.840]   The quote, "Black Friday sales at Apple.com."
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   $41 on some iPods, $101 on some max.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.120]   Kind of a Nemic.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.120]   Yeah, it wasn't a nice.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   But since they never cut, it's better than nothing.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120]   It's better than nothing.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.320]   I mean, if you're going to pick a day and you're going to do it sometime for Christmas
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.120]   anyway, it makes sense.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.320]   I don't think it makes sense to just kind of like when the furniture dealer says, "And
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.000]   we'll pay the sales tax."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   It's on the order of that.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Right.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.760]   Let's just say you're given 8% discount.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.960]   We'll pay the sales tax.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.520]   Or 9.6 in San Francisco.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520]   Well, that's true.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   It's quite a bit in some areas.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   It's...
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.040]   For whatever it's worth, I've just gone onto the online Apple store.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   And if you try to order an 11-inch online, it will still ship within one to three business
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   days.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   Not sold out.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   There's no back-ups.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   Now, have you heard reports?
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.960]   Eric Lanigan had a 13-inch and he said his screen was terrible.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.480]   He couldn't view it on an angle and so forth.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.560]   The 11-inch screen is as good as any screen I've ever used.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   It's very good.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.360]   It's just because he was wearing polarized glasses.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.760]   He was wearing his Ray Bands.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.120]   Have you heard any issues about...
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   I do think the 11 is the one you want, though.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   Don't you think?
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   I agree.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   I love the 11.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.480]   I don't think you need bigger.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.840]   The resolution on this screen is the same as on the 13.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.320]   The only difference is it's 16.9.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.520]   So it feels short.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.800]   Also, there's some apps that aren't used to that 69 aspect ratio.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.280]   For me, once you get into the price of the 13-inch, at least for me, I start to think,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.520]   "Oh, dear.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:21.960]   Now I'm really in-face with the fact that for $1,400, $1,500, I can have a MacBook Pro,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.160]   a MacBook Pro with all these extra features and it weighs a little bit more and it doesn't
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.880]   take up more space in my bag, but it's a lot thicker or I could have the same amount of
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.840]   money and give up so much just for thinness."
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.720]   Which I do.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.520]   That was a challenge on Black Friday because if you had an upgraded MacBook 11-inch MacBook
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.120]   Air, it was the same price as the base model 13.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.200]   So you could, in effect, say, "Well, which screen should I get?"
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.960]   But I think $9.99.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   Don't...
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.800]   Actually, I'd like to hear what you guys think.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.600]   My opinion is don't even put more RAM in or anything.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.320]   Just get the stock $9.99 MacBook Air 11.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.160]   I think it's going to go exactly what you want.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.160]   Part...
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160]   I don't think you need 4Gigs.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   I put 4Gigs in, but I think that was probably a mistake.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640]   On the other hand-
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.240]   How did it run Final Cut?
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   There's the problem.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   It's people like you who put Final Cut on this thing.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.640]   However, what I did is put Lightroom on it.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.320]   I just don't store the catalog or the photos on there because there's only 64 gig drive,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.000]   but I don't see any reason why I couldn't use it to control Lightroom.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I mean, I can think of one other case of where 4Gig is nice.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   Again, my friend who just bought one, his lawyer wife, has to run Windows and...
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.000]   Oh, not on this.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Don't, please.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I know.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I know.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   That's perfect.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   But, you know, but there the extra memory would be nice.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Yeah, I'm not sure I would want to really...
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Yeah, don't get...
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Yeah, I would say don't get this if you think you might want to run Windows.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.400]   Unless you run in boot camp, although I hear there issues getting it working.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.640]   It only runs it infrequently, but very occasionally because other people in their office, you know,
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.320]   the rest of that story.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   For us, Windows 100 and stuff...
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   Windows 100 and stuff.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   Windows 100 and stuff.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.640]   By the way, I just want to point this out on the 8-core Westmere processors with 8Gigs
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   or RAM.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.640]   Man, this Windows run well.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   You know, our...
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.120]   That's our standard install now is Windows.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.280]   We have Windows 7 and OS 10 on every machine.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.520]   I did a boot camp and then I put parallels or I can't remember which fusion.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.840]   And it's great.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   You know, when I pull the...
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   A lot of the apps we have trouble with either fusion or parallels.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840]   I mean, we just...
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   They're just a little bit...
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   You know what?
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   You know what?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   You know what?
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   You know what?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   You know what?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   You know what?
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   You know what?
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.000]   The good test for me is this Windows phone.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.720]   And I plug it in and I told VMware Fusion that when I plug in a Windows phone, that goes
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   to Windows.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.680]   It's running in coherence mode, so that means it just pops up the Zoom.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.200]   It's like I'm running the Zoom software on a Mac.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   You need a lot of...
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.360]   Folks, you need a lot of resources.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.600]   You need fast processors.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.600]   You need...
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.800]   And I gave four whole processors to the Windows and four gigs of phone.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   And I gave them a lot of RAM.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   But then it's great.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.400]   And this is running and it's syncing and doing all that.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.960]   And I'm not leaving the Mac.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   But that's...
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   I wouldn't do that on there.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   I think that's...
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.080]   Now, you're right, Ray.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.920]   If you think you're going to want the RAM, get it.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   Because there's no...
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.840]   I don't know if any way to upgrade the RAM.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.680]   For a while, you could upgrade the solid state drive.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.280]   But now Apple's telling the company that was...
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.320]   It's called PhotoFast.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.280]   That was making these 256...
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.520]   And I wish I'd bought one.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   256 gig.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.800]   Apple is creating a whole new push.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.080]   It used to be that when you release a product, oftentimes, you can put it out at a sale price.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.440]   Like for a limited time only when we release it.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.120]   Now, you don't even do a sale price.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.160]   If you release a product, you can just say, "Good until Apple takes it away."
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.800]   And so people are going to rush to buy this kind of stuff just because they just want
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.360]   to make sure they can get a hold of it.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.880]   It's kind of cool that you could just slot that in there.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   256 gig upgrade kit.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   That's what these guys into a monster.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.560]   You need a special Torx wrench for just the outside.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.960]   Once you're inside, it's pretty standard.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   And it also is faster because I think it had a better control of my arms.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.840]   Do you see the read right on that?
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   You can record uncompressed standard.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.600]   You're having another moment with your air right now, Leo.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   I want it!
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   Uncompressed.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.240]   8C is 100 on the screen.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Maxis second.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.400]   Not just 200.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.520]   Apple said, "Please, they called them last weeks.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.720]   But please stop selling this and they're complying."
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.320]   I think they said, "Hey, you know, understand that you are."
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.120]   "You're going to need to turn this..."
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.040]   Hey guys, if you have any leftover...
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   Just contact me.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.040]   I won't mention it.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.720]   You know, Apple hates me anyway.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   It won't matter.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.080]   We'll say we built it ourselves.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.840]   Yeah, I'll take the label off.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.960]   It looks like a SIM card that you'd snap in.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.240]   Only the connector instead of being on the bottom is on the side of it.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.920]   At what point do you really disconnect from the price here?
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   Oh, what was it?
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   It was priced by the way.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   I should have...
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   Probably thousands, right?
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.880]   But wasn't in the mid-hundred-something?
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   Really?
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.920]   It wasn't like a hundred dollar upgrade.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.480]   It was $500 upgrade.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   That's not bad.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.920]   For 128GB of storage?
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   No, 256GB of...
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   All six.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.200]   No, no, I'm saying for an additional 128GB of storage on what you already had.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   To me, that's...
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   How much?
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.800]   How many problems could...
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.640]   If I go more abstract here and I say that I want to solve every problem and every complaint
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.200]   I might possibly have with my MacBook Air and I've got $500 on which to do it, is it going
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.920]   to be I'm going to spend $500 to double the storage or is it going to be I'm going to
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.600]   buy myself an iPod touch for some things.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.440]   I'm going to buy myself an iS external drive for these other things.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.760]   Am I going to take me and two people out to a really great dinner and then a movie and
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.720]   have them tell me how wonderful my new MacBook Air is?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   No, you're right.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   You're right.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   You're right.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.400]   Four gigs is plenty.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   I did.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   I had a problem.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.520]   Well, it's plenty if you just remember it and say, "Okay, I'm not going to put all
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.720]   my music on it.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.240]   I'm not going to put...
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.600]   I have an external drive that I use for my photos.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   I'm not going to...
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   Well, and I think that some of that becomes...
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   You treat it like an iPad that can run Mac OS X.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.880]   Well, I think some of that becomes more possible as you start to have all these devices able
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   to interact with a local server in your house and in other places that you're going where
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.760]   you can stream a lot of the stuff through AirPlay or whatever where you're able to kind
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.080]   of move things around.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.360]   I know I'm kind of wrestling right now with in my house of being able to kind of get everything
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.600]   integrated so that the TVs and the computers and everything else are accessing a central
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   library of all the music and movies.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.880]   I don't have it completely finished, but like a Mac mini that's kind of serving up all
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   of that stuff.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.720]   You know, I brought...
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.840]   For my birthday, I decided to give a gift.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.600]   So a kid who's a friend of the family, he's 18 years old, he's not been feeling well lately.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.360]   I brought him an iPad.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.520]   And I didn't know what a Mac fanatic he was.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.080]   And literally in five seconds, all of a sudden I hear music coming out of his stereo system.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   He had already figured it out.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.080]   He had AirShare already working.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.160]   He said, "Well, I have an Apple TV."
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   And then he started...
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.120]   And I put 24 on here and he starts playing 24 on the big screen.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.760]   Well, I guess, well, okay, good.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   I'm glad I see you.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.520]   I feel the port and I'm a tech expert.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.480]   I told him I said, "Wow, I've been meaning to do that.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.960]   For me, that's been..."
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   It was so easy.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.400]   I mean, literally, he got it in his hands and he goes, "D-D-D-D-D."
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   And it's playing.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.840]   And that is why I'm finally going to break down and buy the new...
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.360]   I mean, I had the old Apple TV and I didn't know if I'm compelling.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.500]   If you're trying to do that.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.280]   And then you use remote on the iPad.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   So I'm getting one.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.000]   If that's what you wanted, I was blown away.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.520]   The sound was great.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.180]   The picture wasn't so great because I bought 24 back when it was a standard death.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.680]   That's how I get you.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.240]   Yeah, I have to rebuy.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.640]   Anyway, I mean, that's very...
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.880]   I'll tell you, if you want a product demo, that's a great product.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.800]   I mean, within five seconds, he's got air share.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.360]   And it just works.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.080]   I've been using the Apple TV non-stop since I got it.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.680]   And again, compare and contrast to the drawer that the old Apple TV has been in for like
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   a year and a half.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   That's what I'm looking at.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   Solid state, baby.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.640]   No moving pots.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.800]   No tubes in this one.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.320]   Oh, tubes in here, baby.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.520]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   Come back with more.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.960]   We've got the Great Ray Maxwell with us.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.840]   So nice to have you back, Ray, from beautiful Vancouver.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.600]   I'm going to start doing a regular thing with Ray on the radio show.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.520]   He's going to be, what are we going to call you, Ray?
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520]   Explainer in chief.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.160]   Explainer in chief.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.800]   If there's a technology that it does, you know, as complex, you know, I think maybe solid
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.600]   state drives would be good for the next one.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   Haven't been on.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.840]   And explain how it works.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.880]   The explainer in chief, Ray Maxwell.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.480]   Andy and I'll go here from the Chicago Sun times and also Alex Lindsey.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.680]   Our friends at Citrix have a great product for you.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.920]   We'd like to tell you about go to meeting.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.280]   Holidays would be a good time to get go to meeting if you've tried it on the iPad.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.280]   That is so cool.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.960]   I was sitting out in the backyard here because we, you know, our Wi-Fi goes out to the backyard.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   I guess it would work on 3G.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   I didn't even try that.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.760]   But I was sitting on the Wi-Fi in a meeting.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.000]   I didn't tell the meeting attendees, you know, I just, oh, yeah, I'll be at your meeting.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.600]   And what I forgot is that this has a microphone and speakers on it.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   So I didn't need the phone.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.440]   I actually hung up the phone and I'm now doing everything you need to meet in this iPad.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   They can hear me.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   I can hear them.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   It was a, it was kind of a revelation to me.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.040]   I can meet anywhere with go to meeting.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.720]   You can't start meetings with the iPad, but you can on the Mac or Windows and then your
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.200]   attendees can attend on the iPad, which is very cool.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.680]   It's a free application.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.280]   Go to meeting is online meeting made very, very easy and cross platform too, which I
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.600]   think we Mac people appreciate.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.520]   If you go to go to meeting.com/Macbreak, you can try this free for 30 days.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.760]   It does include phone and voice over IP teleconferencing is built in.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.360]   You could set up the meeting ahead of time, send them a link.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.560]   And what's great is it also, you're not remembering it.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   Once you get everybody in and you invite everybody, we use it every week and for meetings and
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.600]   once you set it all up, it's constantly sending out reminders.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.240]   You don't have to make sure that everyone remembers.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   They're all there.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.360]   They have all their login information and they have everything that they need and you
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   don't have to think about it.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.240]   And that's turned out to be a big chunk of why it's valuable to us.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.880]   I was on a conference call this morning and I admit, I dozed.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.040]   It's really easy to doze.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.800]   Go to meeting is what brings it up to the level where, oh, this is engaging.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.480]   At least I'm watching something.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.720]   If you're doing a sales presentation and you have that PowerPoint or keynote presentation,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.840]   you really want to show the client that or maybe the web design or whatever it is, you
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   can't do it over the phone.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   You got to use Go to meeting.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.560]   It really makes a big, big difference.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.720]   It gets much more engaged.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.480]   And I think that's really the key to this is keep everybody on the same page.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.640]   Keep them involved.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.040]   The move meeting moves faster and you get more done.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.960]   It's also good you could collaborate on a document.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   Both of you can work on it.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   All of you, I think you have 15 people in this meeting.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.840]   You could do product demos training.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.400]   If you don't, if you have the software in your system and they don't, but you're training
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.720]   them, you could say, okay, that's how you do it.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.080]   Now you try it and they, they're using it on your machine.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.200]   If you're doing conference calls, bring them to life with Go to meeting.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.640]   I got to remember that for this conference call that I do.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.160]   I don't start it or it would be a Go to meeting call.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.840]   It was so boring this morning.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   Oh, God.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.720]   It's painful.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.960]   But I did get quite a bit of writing done and I worked on the show.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.360]   I always just want to know when I'm on conference calls, I just want to know where the mute
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   is.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.840]   So that I continue to clean my barbecue.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   I did do it.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.760]   You know, I use the Google chat with the headphones, just like the ones, you know, we use on the
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   show.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.440]   I use that mute button and I'm typing away and go, Hey, honey, what's up for dinner tonight?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.240]   You know, they think you're meeting, you know, you know, she probably shouldn't say that
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   out loud.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.800]   It was a great, really enjoyed that meeting.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.280]   So riveting.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.920]   Call to Mac has a article on the reliability survey, the PC world.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.160]   Now you got to figure PC world.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.600]   They cover PCs.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.920]   They're probably, they're probably saying, Oh, which, you know, is it Lenovo?
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   Is it Dell?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.080]   Which, which is the best reliability and service in the industry?
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   And guess who?
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:07.480]   Guess who by like a landslide, according to a PC world, Apple smoked the competition in
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.640]   every category, desktops, notebooks, even smartphones.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.520]   When it comes to smartphones, the lowest rims, blackberries, growing worse than average
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.000]   in every ease of use question.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.040]   And they did actually, let me show you the graphic because it's kind of a, I have to
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   just drag it over here.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.760]   It's kind of a pretty, pretty graphic.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   Apple and HTC's tops in smartphone ease of use, easy to set up.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.160]   You know, it's Apple HTC and then it's down from there.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   RIM didn't do so.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   You see the browse internet?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.760]   You know, easy is really the wrong word.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:49.520]   I mean, a capable browser is the key, frankly, easy to locate and playback music and video,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.120]   satisfaction with quality of phones, I'm sorry, with phones, photo and video quality.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   And again, Apple, HTC Motorola, Paul, you know, those are Android phones, the HTC
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   Motorola's.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   Paul Nokia, Samsung, pretty low, which surprises me.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   Me too.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.320]   Because that's an Android phone.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.240]   I have two Samsung phones.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.600]   I think they do a great job of improving the Android interface.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   So that's a surprise.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   Oh, I agree.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.200]   And the Samsung focus, the Windows phone is a nice build, very high quality.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.560]   LG and RIM down at the bottom there too.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.240]   Overall satisfaction with ease of use.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.640]   It's Apple and Motorola.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.160]   I think those Motorola users are droid users probably, right?
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.720]   I can't think of one of their Motorola handsets unless they're Star-Tac users or something.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.640]   You know, I love my Star-Tac phone.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   I think these are all smartphones.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.320]   Where's Easy to Press button.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.760]   Those are LEDs really pop out at you as you dial.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.800]   That's only a matter of time.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.160]   I wish I had a...
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.600]   Why can't I just have a phone that makes calls?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.200]   Every once in a while I see a non-smartphone and it's just very odd now.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.920]   You know, like in California, you just look over and you're like, "Wow."
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.680]   And yet it's still 80% of the market.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.400]   I think it's mostly outside the US, but they're still...
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   Well, outside of California.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.400]   Outside of San Francisco.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.680]   I think we're just kind of in a bubble.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.960]   Let me ask the chat room.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.560]   There must be somebody in the chat room who has a standard old feature phone.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.560]   In our chat room?
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.560]   No, maybe not.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.560]   Candy bar phone.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.960]   But isn't it a little embarrassing when you pull it out?
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.880]   I noticed when I'm around somebody and they pull...
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.400]   Maybe it's because it's me.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.640]   And they pull out a candy bar phone.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.240]   They always go, "Oh, I'm gonna get a new one."
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   This is...
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.800]   You know what was funny?
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Go ahead.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.560]   The funny part is that when you get those text messages from that one person who says,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   "Tinks for to meet you."
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.560]   Oh, honey.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   You don't have a real keyboard.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.000]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Look at this.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.960]   I'm loaded with people who have feature phones and many of them say, "No, not embarrassed
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   at all.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   I'm proud to say I'm like..."
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.480]   Photo of you with that feature phone holding up a newspaper or a magazine or a website
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   from today.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   I call shenanigans.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.200]   You know, what's funny for me though, I was talking to a producer a couple of weeks
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   ago.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   Chewy in our chat room says, "You poor saps."
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.800]   What's off or using a chat with GE?
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.640]   No, I was talking to a producer.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.840]   And he pulled out a razor.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.480]   I realized that I made a whole lot of decisions about whether I could have him working on a
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   project.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   I was just like...
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   You're right.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   I would have the same.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   I was just like...
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.520]   He's like, "Just a word of warning if you come in here for an interview.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   Have a smartphone or your..."
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520]   I'm just like...
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   I have to...
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   I don't know if you're really going to understand our mark.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.080]   I won't hold it against him if...
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.920]   Well, K-Chepp are chief of engineering here.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.760]   He came in with the door, but at least he had a palm pre.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   Right.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   It wasn't maybe...
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   The best smartphone.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.800]   He's on his like, tenths, by the way, because they break like every five minutes apparently.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.840]   I have to admit that when you were talking to Steve Martin and he talked about doing the
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:59.120]   screenplay for Three Amigos on an IBM display writer, I immediately thought, "But there are
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:05.680]   Apple II-E's with like, Magic Window and like Apple Works and really good machines in 1982,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   1983.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   Why were you doing...
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.800]   Why are you working on a computer that was made out of like, ache and fondant?"
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   It was like...
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.640]   I posted a video of a commercial for this like from 1984 and I'm like, "This is clearly
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.280]   like a 1977 computer because it's just..."
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.280]   There's...
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.200]   By the way, our intern Alex was...
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   What is he using?
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   What is that?
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   He's showing off his...
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   What is that Alex?
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.120]   Is that a flip phone of some vintage?
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Is this your phone?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   Wow.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   It's Verizon Wireless.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   Wow.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   I haven't seen one of these in...
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   And he has a newspaper too, by the way, yeah.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.040]   Wow, it's paper.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   It's paper.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   Look at that.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   Look at this.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040]   How do you turn the papers on?
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   You know, I...
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.040]   So I got a USA Today in...
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.600]   Of course, that's because I pay them $25 a day.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.280]   I mean, it's not really fair.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   It's...
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   You know what?
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   This is in pretty good shape.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   It's like you just got it.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.560]   Now, we can laugh about these old computers, but you saw what an Apple II went for the other
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560]   day.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   Or Apple I.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.560]   Apple I.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.560]   For what?
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   $120,000?
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   Something like that?
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   $210,000?
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.280]   $210,000 for an Apple I.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.680]   So you know, we hang on to those old computers and old cell phones.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.440]   Well, that was a unique...
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.440]   There was some unique features.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.840]   It was touched by the Steves.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.280]   It was touched by the Steves.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.920]   So yeah, I think Steve Martin is not a Mac guy.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   Really?
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   Which is the last thing you'd think.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   Really?
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   How is that possible?
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.160]   I don't know.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   He says...
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   He's tweeted it recently.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   I'm not a Mac guy.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.760]   He uses Windows without look.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   Really?
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   I know.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   It's not what I would have thought.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   That's fine.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.680]   Windows is a fine operating system.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.240]   If you want to spend less than $1,000 on a computer, your answer is almost certainly
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.320]   going to be a PC.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   I liked...
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   It has to be, right?
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   Unless it's a Mac.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   And this is me covering favor with the great...
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   I'll introduce you.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   I'll introduce you.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   I'm not judging you.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.400]   I think he watches, by the way.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.720]   So he knows who you are, Andy.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   He's probably avoiding you actually.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   He's even watching it.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   I've just blown it.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.040]   I think we all have to pitch together and buy Steve a netbooker.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.800]   I mean, I mean, I mean, I think he has everything he wants.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   He has three...
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.960]   I'm totally has three iPads.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.640]   I think that we need to suggest that he thinks a little harder about everything that he wants.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   I loved it, though.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   He said, "I got...
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   If you want to move it, he's writing the three amigos.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.400]   He wants to move a paragraph.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.320]   He moves it, but then he gets up and goes out a cup of coffee because of his playwright
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   who takes so long to reposition a paragraph.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.920]   We've come along.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.000]   I think the B side to the Steve Martin Brothers album, which is I think his last album on Columbia
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.840]   is what really did it for me for his music.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.960]   As I recall, those were demo tapes that he originally made in 1969, 1970 when he was
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.720]   still pursuing the music as much as a comedy.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   He's building two albums in the 90s.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.360]   I'm not just one of these Johnny Cum lately, Steve Martin.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   You know, when you meet him, I want you to do this, Andy.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.720]   I want you to go, "Will excuse me!"
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.400]   I'm sure you really love that.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   You will.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.720]   You want me to do this so that you will seem cooler by comparison.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.760]   Steve, I'm so sorry.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   I shouldn't have...
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.000]   He'll just look at you and go, "Wow, no one's ever done that."
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.040]   Can you imagine, for probably 10 years of his life, he couldn't walk down the street without
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   some knit with shouting.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.440]   Hey, Steve!
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.120]   Excuse me.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:40.280]   I'm sorry, iPad prompts Gartner to trim PC shipment forecasts, the success of the iPad.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.520]   Now this story says, "And other media tablets."
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   But I don't really...
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520]   I guess...
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:51.600]   I mean, it's really a report that's an anticipation of this whole thing exploding in 2011.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.680]   Obviously, Apple already had a huge success with the iPad.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:41:00.800]   Once Android 3.0, which is the first version of Android that's really intended to be done
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.480]   on a tablet ships, and once all these other shoes start dropping because it seems as though
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.680]   every single manufacturer who looked as though they were going to get in the tablet game in
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.760]   2010 decided to hold off until 2011 until they could figure out what they really wanted
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.320]   to make, it really demonstrated that not...
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.440]   I think this is not so much a direct response to the success of the iPad, to the success
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.520]   of some alternative to a netbook of the teams as though it demonstrated that the netbook
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.400]   is not a perfect solution for a lot of people, it was just the best solution for what was
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   available.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.000]   And once they're more tablets, it'll become even more...
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.240]   It's really interesting how you can slant stuff with just the way you phrase it, because
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.560]   really, if you read the article, this is from CNET, the title, the headline is "Ipad
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.600]   prompts Gartner to trim PC shipment forecasts," which is absolutely true.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.640]   But they're trimming it.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.080]   This is for 2010.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.720]   They're trimming it from something like $370 million to $352 million.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.160]   The number that they think...
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.000]   So there's still money to be made.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Let's be clear.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.040]   If you read the headline, you might go, "I'm getting out of that PC business."
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.240]   No, $352 million units from $372 million.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   Why didn't you set far to our Dell Tower?
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.200]   Because I read something on the internet and I'm panicked, I'm sorry.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.320]   Well, that's the 18 million tablets they think they're going to be sold.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   They just took those out of...
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   I think those are having a direct impact on...
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.720]   It probably isn't one to one.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:29.400]   I think not every tablet buyer is not going to buy a PC or is out of the market.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.760]   Although you've got to figure, somebody spends 500 bucks on a...
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.280]   There's a limited amount of discretionary income.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.560]   Somebody spends money, a lot of money on this device, they're much less likely to spend
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.720]   that money on a PC.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.320]   I mean, if that makes sense.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   I don't know if it's a one to one correspondence, but it's maybe close to it.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:52.560]   Paul Thorett had a similar...
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.920]   Because Paul dared in his headline to say, "How can Apple fix the iPad in 2011?"
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.760]   Groobers said, "Implying there's something wrong with it."
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   It's true though.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   It is true.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.600]   Probably there's nothing to fix in the iPad.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.240]   I mean, is there anything wrong with the iPad?
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.960]   There's lots of things that I'd like to have added.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.160]   I don't know if I'd say "Fayas" is the right word.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   But that just shows.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   With one word in a headline, you can imply all sorts of things.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   Create drama.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   Create drama.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.760]   Where you get people to come to your site.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.720]   That's what blockers do.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.560]   An area that I would like to see fixed is the people who are trying to learn to publish
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.400]   for the iPad.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.960]   One example of this is...
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.520]   I don't know whether you've looked at this, but Time magazine now.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.800]   You can go to the App Store and you can buy a Time app at a time.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   It gives you the privilege of buying Time magazine.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.680]   One issue to Time for $4.99.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:00.040]   Now there are 56 issues a year which you can subscribe to the paper version for only $20.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   I think it's...
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   No.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.440]   I'm what I'm hoping to see is when we see the next iWork and a lot of other things in addition
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.560]   to cloud editing and so on and so forth.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:16.300]   I really feel like whether it's using the Final Cut Studio or the iWork is building
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   publishing tools.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.640]   You want Apple to make the tools.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.440]   Apple should be making the tools to publish it because right now it is painful to publish
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.520]   a very interactive media device.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Well, is it kind of...
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.680]   Is it kind of something that you could design and Apple should be building that?
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.800]   Isn't it kind of like the web where if you're going to make...
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   Well we'll talk a little bit about Richard Branson's new project.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.320]   If you're going to make something like that, you really write a content management system
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.520]   that generates...
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   And everybody's...
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.960]   Just as on the web there's WordPress and there's Joomla and there's Drupal.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.560]   I guess it's kind of like that on the iPad that the first step in making a magazine is
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.320]   running a content management system.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.040]   The advantage of doing it that way is these all look unique and different have different
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   capabilities.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.400]   In fact, project is quite impressive.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.840]   Popular science is quite impressive.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.400]   Time magazine is a PDF.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.120]   The New Yorker is a little more than a PDF but not much.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.440]   And when you look at something like pages, pages already let you import movies.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   It already let you import photos.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   It's using the hand.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   I'm saying the tool.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.200]   I'm saying they have all the tools there and it's just a matter of building a solid publishing
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.600]   pipe that would let you pipe...
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   I agree.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.040]   I think that there are people who are...
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.240]   Cat Fancy Magazine might use that to create a kind of standard magazine but then there
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.320]   are going to be people like Richard Branson who say, "Well I want them.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   Wait till you see project.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.400]   I want to do something that is unique."
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   But I think that...
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   And I think you can do...
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.760]   I mean I guess what I'm saying is that with those kinds of tools built in, you would
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.240]   actually get more unique views of it because it's not that...
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.360]   I'm not looking for something that funnels it all into a template but what I'm saying
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.600]   is that is having easy to publish tools that anybody...
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.800]   So if anybody could buy iWork for instance and be able to build an ad interactive features
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.400]   and clickable items and design elements and so on and so forth, you'd end up with this
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   kind of...
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.800]   The same explosion we saw went with Photoshop and PageMaker and everything else in the early
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.840]   90s where suddenly every magazine started looking different because they didn't have
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   to typeset it anymore.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.520]   And it became an entirely different bottle of wax and it was a lot of bad stuff was created
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.680]   during that time.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   And finally...
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.560]   And you saw ones that were really design heavy like Raygun was a great magazine to look
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   at.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.360]   I don't think I've ever read an article in Raygun because I couldn't.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:26.320]   But I think that that would create an huge explosion of content being developed for the
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.320]   iPad.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   I want to address this.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.880]   I want to show you Richard Branson, the new Virgin magazine.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.440]   I also, we didn't really get through these Paul's objections to the iPad.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.040]   What he thinks is wrong with the iPad and what he'd like to do.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.400]   And I'd like to hear from you guys what you think the next generation might include.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.760]   We're starting to hear some rumors, just rumors about the next gen iPad.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.080]   But I presume that they will, they're on a yearly cycle.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.040]   You know, everybody said, "Oh, there's going to be a Christmas iPad too late.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.560]   Not going to happen now."
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.040]   But I presume in either...
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.120]   Well, it may be January, maybe it's later.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.120]   They'll announce...
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.120]   March.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   Announce.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   It's in January of this year.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.120]   Do they announce the same one?
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.280]   And then they shipped in what April and May.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   So I don't...
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.760]   But they doesn't mean that the iPhone moved around.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   There wasn't any kind of...
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.000]   Not much, but it moved around a little bit on that announcement date moved around.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.960]   So we'll see.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.960]   But let's talk about that.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.400]   The future for the iPad.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.400]   What Paul Theron thinks is wrong, what you think is right or wrong, and what you think
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   the iPad should have.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.720]   And then I would like to show you this new Virgin magazine because it's actually pretty
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.240]   sweet.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.960]   Before we do that though, speaking of sweet.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.320]   WhereSpace.com.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:38.920]   I was listening to this American life there also talking about Squarespace.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.200]   It is a secret to great websites.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   It's nice to have Alex sitting here because he's a guy who has completely adopted the
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   Squarespace platform.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   I mean, you've become...
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.440]   Well, we use a space fanatic.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.600]   It's just the one that I can get stuck down on.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.960]   If I have an idea of something that I want to go...
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.960]   So if you go to...
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   Maybe this is the...
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.760]   But see, this is a content management system.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   Maybe this is the kind of thing that you're doing.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:06.040]   I mean, if you look at like border sack, for instance, which is my little blog, it's...
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040]   And I don't...
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   What is the...
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.600]   I don't add stuff to it often enough.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.840]   But B-O-R-D-E-R-S-A-C.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.640]   What's that come from?
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.920]   It's a long story.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.800]   So.com.com.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   And anyway, so...
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   Oh, this is nice.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   This is it?
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   Yeah, this is...
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.920]   And some of this is a Squarespace blog.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.240]   This is a Squarespace blog.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   So this is...
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.400]   And I put this together in three or four hours on Squarespace.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   You know, I know that story and I've told it a few times, if you're going to a restaurant
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.480]   saying you don't have a website, if you're making at the table...
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.920]   A website for them with Squarespace.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   Because you can do it for free.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.680]   And then saying, "Hey, it's here if you want it."
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.600]   And so this is some of my travel blogs in there.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   Still golly.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.600]   This is from Tanzania.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.520]   And so some of us travel, some of us, whatever I want.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.000]   But if I want to add another section, if I want to do whatever I want to do...
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.600]   Yeah, we did this a few years ago with Vox, which is the way it lamented.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   And it's gone.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.840]   But the beauty of this is it's not ad supported.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.160]   So you know they're going to be around.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.400]   You don't have somebody else's ads in there, which is...
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   There's me with a...
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   Nice.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   Me experimenting with my goatee.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   Glad you shaved that off.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   Me too.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   So my wife looked at a go...
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Oh, yeah, you're going to get rid of that.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.400]   So I was going to go mustache for Movember and my wife said no.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   Yeah, it didn't work for me.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.800]   And then now, if you go to...
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.080]   If you go to pixelcore.com, is that a Squarespace blog also?
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.080]   I didn't know that.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   So just to give you an idea of what's happening...
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   It just sounds different in there.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   Yeah, so here...
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   I think got two P's in there.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   Two P's in the pod.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   Pixelcore.com.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   pixelcore.com.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   pixelcore.com.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   Oh, rps.com.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   So here is a completely different look.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   Whoa.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   Now, that's interesting.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   It looks like Comcast has taken over my searches.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   Boy, I'm starting not to like a Comcast very much.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   Okay, so try Pixelcore.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.080]   We'll talk about that in the number one.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   But this is nasty.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.080]   I'm getting off of that.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   So here's a completely different look.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   Once again, look at that.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   I love how you put the big image there.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   Because that's really says this is what we do.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   And so...
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   Which is...
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080]   Makeded this by the way, by the way.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   That's a...
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   So the physical mix of these molding.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Anyway, so the point is, is a completely different look.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   A completely different layout.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   And it's all out of the same thing.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   It's just great.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   As long as you type in a URL, type in squarespace.com.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   You can start your own site right now for free.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   and click the green "try it for free" button.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   All you have to do is give it a site name, a password,
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.080]   an email address for recovering the password and it in the capture.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   And you've got a site.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   Now you can start playing with it.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.080]   And I'll tell you the template.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   60 plus designer templates.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   But that's just the starting point.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.080]   Because as you design your Squarespace blog,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   the Ajax interface that allows you to modify the template
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   makes it so easy.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   You just drag margins around.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   Click on this.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   Click on that.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   Every site looks different without any use of CSS or JavaScript.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   Of course, if you're a CSS junkie or JavaScript hacker,
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.080]   you can do anything because it's completely compatible to that as well.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   So you have full control, but you don't need to have those skills
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   to make a site that looks like a pro.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.080]   And then you also know that it's not going to, you're not,
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   you're not, you're not colowing and worried about their server going down
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   or whatever.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.080]   So, you know, you throw up, we threw up some big stuff.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.080]   DV garage is also Squarespace.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   And we threw up, you know, four gigs of files.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   And we know that, yeah, people are going to start downloading them
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   for Ask a Ninja and it's going to work.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   One of the neat things is that they, it's all Java based and they use
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   a very sophisticated Java virtual server technology that makes,
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   guarantees you the bandwidth.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   You never have to worry about your site.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   It's just, it's robust, reliable as can be.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   Now you're for hosting and the software $12 a month,
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   you can save 10% if you use the offer code MAC break.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   That's not just for the first month or first year,
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   but for the life of your site.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   There are more features for more money.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   You see what you need.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   You can upgrade at any time.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.080]   But do use the offer code MAC break so you save that money.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.080]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   If you're starting, starting at your first site or if you need a site
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.080]   for a special occasion, Squarespace, that's the place to go.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   So, first let's talk about Paul Therat.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   (laughs)
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   And Paul's not on to defend himself, but he does have his own.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   And he will be talking about this, I'm sure.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   He says the iPad too expensive, too heavy, not enough power.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.080]   I would disagree.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.080]   I would say the iPad is perfect for what it, for the first generation.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.080]   Would you guys agree?
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   Would you, would you, would you say there was a flaw Andy in the existing iPad?
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   I wouldn't say so.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.080]   I mean, too, too heavy compared to what?
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.080]   Not powerful, again, compared to what.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   It's just, it was designed for a specific purpose.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   It was not designed to run every version of Windows dating back to Windows 2.0.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.080]   It was designed to run this brand new operating system that was optimized
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.080]   for tablet multi-touch computing.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.080]   He says millions of people have foolishly, (laughs)
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   I'm sorry, Paul, foolishly jumped on the iPad bandwagon too soon,
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.080]   adopting a device that is too expensive, too heavy, too big, and too limited.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.080]   That sounds like the sort of thing that Vincent Price would say
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   from high above a laboratory castle.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.080]   Millions of people have foolishly embraced the iPad.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   Well, they laughed at me in my device.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   Well, they shall start to weep tomorrow when I wreak my vengeance upon the world.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.080]   You know, how many people foolishly adopted Windows tablets over the last ten years?
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   Now, that was foolish.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   I am one of them, by the way.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   They worked well for what they were, you know, they were promoted as like a real like every person sort of computer.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:45.080]   They actually had some success as specific devices for people who need to run enterprise
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   and like specific contracted software in a tablet form.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   So like in medicine, it worked well.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   For people who are doing lighting rigs, it worked well.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   But no, it never lived up to its promise.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.080]   I mean, I think that Apple is the first person to crack it for consumers
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   in terms of what I would like to see.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   And I can't think of anything specifically that Apple did wrong with this first version.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   I would like to see, for instance, the USB camera adapter elevated into an actual USB.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   Stop selling it as a USB as a camera adapter and start selling it as an actual USB port.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   So that if someone wants to write a piece of software that's specifically designed to interface like a scanner to like one of those little like bar scanners to it.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   Don't even make it as complicated as we have to have a brand new sort of driver architecture for it.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   But I would love to see things like microphones and like a little USB camera adopted as not as a hack, but as here's something that's expected.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   Could you do that through the 30 pin?
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   I was going to say he doesn't, they don't really need to do anything.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.080]   They just release a better adapter or put drivers on the thing.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   The big problem is that of course, right now with a 30 pin is that you have all this control that Apple has over what you can connect to it, which is what.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   I want VGA out for everything, for instance.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   I want the screen.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   I want the eye out too.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   For me, the only thing that I will be bummed about when it comes out that I don't have on mind is the front facing camera.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   I really want to have or a camera in general.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   I'm upgrading.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   Well, I'm upgrading to you.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   I'm an upgrade.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   I'm an upgrade.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   And then someone else, one of my other kids will have on my other side.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   So here's what he says, pricing.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   And I think he's right.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.080]   There's some pressure now because of the new Android tablets to drop the price a little bit.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   He said in today's product line 32GB should be $2.99, 64GB, $3.99.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.080]   Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   You're not going to build something like the iPad where you can drop it a foot and not even care that's going to break because it's not going to further.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.080]   I mean, they build it nice enough.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   That's a Windows guy.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   That's a Windows guy, a PC guy talking.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.080]   Look what happened to the PC marketplace.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   These companies did, in fact, get down to those low prices.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   They've got no support.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   They've got no margin.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   There's no incentive to support.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   There's no sad to develop.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   This is not Apple's model.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   Apple charges a premium price.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:56:00.080]   It's a hell of a lot of money on each unit and puts that money into support and better products.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   And so I think that that's just a different worldview, perhaps.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   He says form factor.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   Now, this one, I might agree with him.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   He said, it should weigh the same as the Amazon Kindle, if it could.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   Could it?
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   Could it?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   Could it be a Kindle sized?
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   If Apple could acquire the company that has the patents on Flubber, that's really wonderful.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   If it could float.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   But for me, the battery, being able to have it run for 10 hours was a little way.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   I'll give you the way.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   Yesterday, my son spent most of the trip from LA on it.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   Come on, Paul.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   Look at it.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   It's not that big.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.680]   It's not that heavy.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.080]   This is a very elegant device.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.680]   It doesn't feel or look like a first generation anything.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.720]   That is a work of art, if you ask me.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.720]   I don't know.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.480]   I'm not sure I would agree with him on that.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.920]   I think where he's coming from on that is that some people, I might, that was the only
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.120]   complaint when my wife played with mine.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.840]   That was her only complaint is holding it up in front of her.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.400]   She thought it could be a little lighter.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:07.040]   But what I found is you can always sit it in a stand or you know what I'm saying.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:13.000]   I mean, this is, if you came from, if you came from 10 years ago and you saw this.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Right.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   You'd be like, man.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.280]   Six months ago, I mean, when I first saw this in January, I was blown away.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.920]   In fact, remember, one of the reason people said, oh, this won't sell that well is they
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.480]   hadn't tried one.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.840]   And when you held it in your hands, you got it immediately.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:34.720]   It was like, okay, that's a pretty, I want one.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.440]   This is going to change publishing.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.320]   And by the way, Leo, just, you know, you're talking about the tools for publishing on this
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.520]   and so forth.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:49.000]   A person we might get on as a guest someday because he's just gone over to an iPad version.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.160]   A guy who's led in electronic publishing, in my opinion, is Brooks Jensen of Linzware.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.760]   He's doing, Linzware is coming out in an iPad version.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   Now that's a monochrome, isn't it?
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.120]   I mean, it's a black and white magazine.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   That'll be very interesting.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.800]   How does it look on the iPad?
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.960]   It looks very nice.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.360]   And by the way, he is now including color on the iPad version.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.360]   Interesting.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:17.880]   But here's a guy that runs a small publishing company in Anacornis, Washington, with only
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.760]   four people and he's publishing for the iPad.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.600]   And his stuff is handmade.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   I mean, in effect, I mean, it is really...
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.640]   And it is interactive.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.800]   He uses the audio, he uses the video.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.560]   He was doing it in PDF form.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   That's right.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.400]   He was publishing PDF on DVDs.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.280]   And so he's been a bit of a pioneer in electronic publishing.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.480]   That's not out yet.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.880]   Lenzware or is it?
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.400]   I don't think it is because I'm not seeing it on my search.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   So I don't think it is.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   Okay.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.320]   Well, Linzware, it'll be out shortly because if it's not, I thought it was already out,
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.640]   but I know he's going there.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   It'll be called Lenzware.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   It'll be called Lenzware.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   Yes.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640]   My money mistyped it.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   But I'll keep looking.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   But that's...
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.000]   If you're into photography, that is an amazing magazine.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   I would never have discovered it except for you, Ray.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.160]   El photographo.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.160]   It's out.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.880]   I don't think that's Lenzware.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.800]   El photographo is what I find when I search for Lenzware two words and I have to find
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   nothing.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.360]   I want to archive magazine.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.000]   When archived magazine is on the iPad.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I think I've done it for every last...
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.560]   I think that there is a future.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.920]   There is a future for those kinds of magazines on this device.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:35.080]   So Paul says more storage, camera obviously.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.320]   We want front facing and rear facing, don't we?
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.840]   And I would be blown away if Apple did not have a front and back facing camera on the
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.840]   next version.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   They got it.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   I mean, Samsung does.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.480]   I mean, the iPad touch has them.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.480]   Now, what about the screen?
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.240]   I put a...
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.600]   For TV work, I put a plastic cover on it.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.000]   The camera.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.680]   I love the screen and matte screen.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.040]   And frankly, I would rip it off in a minute if I didn't have to shoot this because I like
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040]   the glossy screen.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.520]   But I know you guys aren't glossy screen.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.240]   I do notice, I have to admit that I do like the rich blacks you get when you don't have
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.240]   the matte.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   I used to complain a lot about it.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.160]   And I still have matte stuff on some of my stuff.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   But I do...
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   When I look at somebody here, it's really interesting.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.480]   Here, play my matte iPad and see.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   Yeah, it's just not...
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   It's just not a...
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   The blacks aren't...
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480]   The blacks aren't actually nice.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   I want it to be black.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   I feel like I feel like the screen is a good protector.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.880]   I just took a look.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:32.680]   And Linzwerk is putting out a downloadable PDF version formatted.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.440]   So he's not in the App Store.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   Got it.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   Not yet.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   Got it.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   So you just put that PDF on there.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   That's a good way to do it.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.640]   But it is set up for the iPad.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   I'll get it.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.200]   You know, in format, whatnot.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.840]   Andy, you were saying?
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.880]   I was just going to say that I feel as though the screen protector makes the screen look
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   a little bad all the time.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.800]   Whereas the glossy screen makes it look a little bad only a fraction of the time for me.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.280]   So it helps us for shooting.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.880]   I mean, you can see what a much better...
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.160]   You don't get any reflection in the shot and that's why I leave this on.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   Absolutely.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.040]   It'd be nice maybe to have a choice, but I don't mind the glossy screen.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   I'm a fan.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   Plus, I'm impressed.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.400]   I've been carrying this iPad around absolutely everywhere with...
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.280]   Usually without much protection on it.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.480]   And it still looks pretty much factory new.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   Well, that's another thing.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   The screen.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   It wears quite well.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:26.000]   So here's the Richard Branson project released last night at midnight.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.080]   We've seen a lot of people do magazines now on the iPad.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.280]   And with varying results, I think popular science was the poster boy.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.800]   I'm sorry, I keep going to the comment section.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.800]   It was a crazy...
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   I didn't...
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   The popular science wanted me a little muddy.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.560]   I had a hard time reading it.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.440]   Some have complained that the...
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   Look at this.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.280]   This is the front cover.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.920]   It looks like a normal magazine cover.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.760]   This is where I think he's using the iPad quite effectively.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.640]   Jeff Bridges is on the cover promoting Tron, obviously.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.480]   And it de-resis and you get a bad video signal.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.160]   And it really lets you know, yeah, it's a magazine, but it's not quite a magazine.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.600]   It's alive.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.680]   And I think this is nicely done.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.720]   There's music articles in here where you can hear the music.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.200]   It uses the...
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.520]   In a way, this is very much like the...
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.480]   Look at that.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.120]   There's an illustration, but it's really a video, right?
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   That comes alive.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   I think that there's...
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.520]   It's amazing, though, how much money does this cost to produce?
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.600]   Yeah, and it's a $4.99 issue.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.760]   So it's not cheap.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.640]   I think it's $4.99, not cheap.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.240]   But look at this.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   I can actually...
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   It's interactive in ways...
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   I mean, this is a magazine.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.640]   That's an ad for American Express.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.800]   This is an ad!
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.960]   Now, you got to figure that's a compelling pitch to American Express, is that we can...
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.640]   We can bring your ads to life here.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.040]   No, I can't get out of it.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.040]   Oh, there it goes.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   That's what it's like.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.720]   How much is it worth to leave this ad?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.280]   It went out, out, out!
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.640]   So he's...
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   It's a little navigation.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.520]   You know, I guess you got to get used to it.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.880]   Here's the table of contents.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.080]   You can scroll through a thumbnails at the bottom.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   Some people...
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   I haven't really read it yet.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   I just got it.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.080]   I don't know...
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:19.120]   Not a lot of pages, which was not surprising given the production.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   But how to use project?
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   There you go.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120]   Here's the instructions.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.000]   There's an action button.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   There's numbered buttons.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.400]   There's hotspots.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   There's a spine.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   There's a forum.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   I like that, by the way.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.560]   There's an interactive forum on all pages that you can put those comments to and read
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   comments.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]   This is a...
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.760]   I think this is the magazine reinvented in some ways.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.560]   Even the how to use has a forum button, so I can leave a comment.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.000]   What I'd be really interested to see is something like this where instead of a forum, it was
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.960]   an IRC of anyone else reading the article at the same time.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.160]   Oh, I'd love that.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.520]   It's kind of like Flipboard where you could see the tweets about an article.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.680]   But literally just open up an article that is a little disgusting.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680]   Why not?
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   These are always connected.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.680]   Bring it to life.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.920]   It kind of calls back to what you were saying earlier, Alex.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.760]   Wouldn't it be great if they were a common authoring tool, not just so that people could
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.560]   get more stuff on there, but so that whenever I buy one of these magazines, I don't need
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.720]   to go to an instructions page to figure out how to make it work?
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   Right.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.240]   Well, and also like, hey, I want to wire these interactive things into it.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.880]   And being able to have those as widgets, rather than something I have to write, would
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.040]   have a lot of people doing a lot of fun stuff and theoretically people be able to write
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.880]   the widgets.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.760]   Nevertheless, it's great.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.160]   Look at this thing's been out six, nine months now, right?
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.600]   We're starting to see really innovative uses of it.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   I think it's just the beginning.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.560]   I think this and when we see what happens with Fox and we see, you know, I think they're
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.640]   going to see a bunch of people really starting to turn this.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.640]   And now cover shoots are going to.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.640]   Well, I know what that is.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.360]   Be a lot more complicated.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.760]   They're scanning him, right?
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.640]   Well, it's probably getting all the things.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.200]   Because they did the Benjamin Button CG thing.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.080]   I don't know if it really in the trailer.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.680]   I don't know if it totally worked.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.960]   Like there's, well, they got to make Jeff Bridges look young.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.720]   They got a little into the uncanny valley and they didn't get out.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.520]   Yeah, uncanny valley.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.920]   You know, I have to say though, this is going to give new life to the way a magazine works
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.240]   because you got a cover story about a guy.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.680]   You got video, right?
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.720]   I think this is really vanity fair is going to.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.160]   Could could, you know, this is what vanity fair ought to be doing.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.640]   We're still we're still navigating a lot of interesting questions about what how people
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.040]   really what people really want to get out of these magazines.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:33.360]   I have a friend who keeps forwarding me really good links from the onion and I will always
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   click on it.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.440]   If it's a text link, I will almost never click on it.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.360]   If it's a video link, because if it's text, I know that I can get a good overview of it
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.400]   in about four seconds just by looking at the page with video.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.280]   I know that I've got to sit there and be patient for 10 or 15 seconds before I figure out
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   if this is something I want.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.680]   I also got to watch some stupid ad.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.680]   Look at this.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.040]   I'm not sure how patient I would be to.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040]   Okay.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.120]   So I'm looking at Jeff Bridges shifting awkwardly in the middle of the screen and now he's in
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.280]   front of the in front of the ocean.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.200]   Now he's sort of strolling off to the left as the first paragraph covers in and I'd be
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.000]   like, okay, just give me the damn article.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.080]   I think I could have gotten out of it.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.080]   We'll see off.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   And I'm watching this though.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.000]   I'm not necessarily saying that I'm right either.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.880]   I'm saying that that's potentially a problem.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   I understand.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.320]   Here's a frames, 12 frames from his movies.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   I tap one term that we use was a dance belt, but it basically what he's talking about in
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.480]   that movie.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.320]   Now I think that's freaking awesome.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.480]   Remember reading that script and if we can only get the licensing so that we could actually
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.640]   watch the video of that while he's talking.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.280]   Well, I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.960]   You know, that's pretty impressive.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   So this, okay, let's see.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.600]   This is the thing where you're saying, okay, I just want to read the article and go right
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600]   to the article.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.600]   Okay.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   You're right.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.160]   I think this is a huge step forward.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.360]   I mean, it looks gorgeous.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   I want the content.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.440]   I'll have to see how good the content is.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.400]   It really looks like Vanity Fair.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   And I'll be honest with you.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:07.040]   I think they could put Vanity Fair out of business pretty darn quick.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.160]   And you're going to think advert, eat my dirt.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.760]   You're going to think advertisers.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:17.720]   If I rub this, you got to think of advertisers.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   They get creative.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.840]   This is going to be really this is a, this is a food.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.920]   How food is becoming more down to earth with the aid of a great Dane?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   Wow.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   You know what?
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   That is a great cover.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.160]   That's the cover to this article is I scrape the dirt off.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.760]   That's pretty cool.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.920]   Now, I don't know what I do next though.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.600]   I buy the Noma book.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.800]   So there's links there.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:47.560]   This is something that Rupert Murdoch said we're never going to do is outbound links.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.400]   I kind of like that that they've actually got an outbound link section.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.080]   I would love a share thing, but I guess you can't share.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.080]   Oh, there it goes.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.920]   You can't share it unless others have the magazine.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.320]   But it's pretty cool.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   Very readable.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   Very readable.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.960]   I always, and I have to say this is a problem I have with a lot of magazines.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.800]   I always want to pinch and zoom and I can't because it's not a browser.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.480]   I also just want to, there's a lot of times now when I want to click on that text, all
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.240]   the text in a magazine and just have a play audio so I can look at stuff or look up or
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.720]   listen to it or, you know, Audible has ruined me.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720]   Yep.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.600]   I know where I just don't, I don't really want to read that.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.040]   I'd like to look at this pretty picture.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.120]   Just tell me what that says.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.000]   I'm really pleased that this is a crazy billionaire project though, because with Richard Branson
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   involved, with Rupert Murdoch involved, with Jeff Bezos involved, you know they're
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.440]   going to stick with it and solve these problems.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.240]   Not only that, but get a solution they think works, but then listen a year later to find
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.680]   out, okay, we sold eight copies of this.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.000]   Why didn't we sell eight million?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.920]   Let's move on to the next thing and try to figure out how to make this work.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.200]   Too many startups are just going to say, you know what, we tried that.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   It didn't work out.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.720]   So we decided just to burn plain PDFs of the magazine edition.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.560]   And if we get eight dollars from it a month, then we just got eight dollars a month from
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   it.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   Right.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   It's incremental income.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560]   I'm sure this costs millions to make.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560]   Very interesting.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.160]   It's free to download the player.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.240]   Thank you, Richard.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.960]   And then they have US, Canadian and British versions.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.320]   And when you buy an issue, by the way, I would just pay attention because I just click
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.600]   the first icon and it turns out I bought the British edition.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.120]   I don't know what that means, whether I'm unhappy about it or not.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:33.160]   In publishing magazines, one of the things I stumbled into is I subscribed to Scientific
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:38.840]   American, the PDF version, which you can download, read under iBooks and so forth on
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.320]   the iPad.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.360]   But I'll wait a minute.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:48.960]   Let me go to the iTunes store and see if I can get, is there an app for Scientific American?
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.960]   And there is.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   Oh, interesting.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.760]   For the Brazil edition.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.560]   Oh, thank you.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   All right.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   Yes.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560]   Yes.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.720]   If you've always wanted to read Scientific American in Portuguese, that's funny.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720]   You're all set.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.280]   It's not showing me available issues.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.160]   So I can't remember exactly how much it costs.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.360]   By my senses, it was, oh, here it is.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360]   Yeah, $2.99.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.720]   That's not so bad.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.560]   And then you could preview the issue before you buy.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.760]   So there's a way to look at it.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.760]   Great.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   I think this is close.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   It's getting there.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   It's close.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.480]   I mean, the problem I have with what Rupert wants to do and in some ways with what this
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.600]   is, is it's not the web.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.800]   You could do everything.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.680]   Could you, I think you could do everything we're seeing here with HTML5.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.360]   In fact, it may be done with HTML5 for all we know.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.360]   Yes.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   It really is all about tools.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:39.440]   I keep talking, I keep talking to a bunch of different people who have smaller magazines
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.640]   and the solution they want, they love the iPad and they love these really rich media
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.400]   magazines you can get from them, but they really don't have the sort of money or the
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.360]   sort of resources to build great apps.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.560]   They really want that company where they just send them an InDesign file or just send
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.640]   them whatever the end product of their normal editorial processes and get back.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.760]   They're a working iPad app a day later.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.280]   I have to think that Apple also has limited resources and probably would like to do this.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.960]   It certainly would be on my list of things to do, but maybe they just don't have time.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   I think that the problems are doing so hard.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.120]   They're having such a hard time financially.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   Yes, right.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.560]   I think that actually exists.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.640]   So I get some of my magazines through a company called Zinos.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.160]   Oh, Zinnia, that was, yeah, right.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.600]   But, and I think, and they're, they seem to be just the strictly paper version.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.480]   You know that convert the iPad.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   They have a tool.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   That's right.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   That's what that's worth it going to.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.800]   That's not going to push iPad development further.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.080]   Also, it's not a distinctive mark for the iPad because Zinnia was available for pretty
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.800]   much every mobile device you can, you can name, which is nice in that it makes these
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.960]   things more accessible.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.640]   But people really don't think about it.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.440]   But people think I've got this wonderful $500 tablet or even for Samsung people.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.440]   I've got this wonderful, well, $569 tablet, but let's let's assume they're cheaper tablets
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440]   coming out.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.320]   And now I'm going to really see the wonders of tablet computing.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.760]   Oh, it's Scientific American, but I have to turn pages more often.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760]   Okay.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760]   That was a fun way to spend $404.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:17.880]   Well, if it's, but if the publishing price is lower and it's more convenient, see, I mean,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.200]   I love the fact that I can be reading Scientific American while, you know, sitting in bed at
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:30.120]   night and it, they review a book and I can go to Kindle app and buy the book and be reading
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   it in the next two minutes, you know?
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.640]   I'm so over paper.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.640]   I'm just like, I am like, I just don't, I don't even think about it anymore.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.400]   I mean, I just, I look at stuff and I go, I'm going to wait for that because I just, you
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.280]   know, I just, as soon as, and it, what happened for me, the breaking point was wired, which
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.000]   is something that I always bought.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.560]   And as soon as wired that, even though it was kind of a really clunky version, the very
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.280]   first one that came out, I was like, Oh, I really don't want to buy this on paper anymore.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.040]   And the idea of having a collection of all of those things.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.520]   So I have tons of books and I have tons of audio books and tons of magazines all in one
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.080]   little thing that I'm carrying around rather than lugging all that stuff around has just
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.400]   made such a huge difference for me that I'm just kind of done.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   It does smell it.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   Go ahead.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.720]   You know, one of the, one of the other advantages, you know, I subscribe, same thing with Scientific
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:18.120]   American, I'd subscribe to it on paper and when it came out in PDF, I immediately switched.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.400]   But when I subscribe to Scientific American for $29 a year, it gives me access to all
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.520]   of the Scientific American, I forget 10 or 20 years of their archives.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.680]   So I can go back and download a past issue.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.080]   And that's pretty incredible for that price.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.400]   You know, like to a search on any subject I'm looking for.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.360]   They just put Playboy magazine every issue of Playboy magazine on a hard drive.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.960]   You could buy on a hard drive.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   Appropriate.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.560]   When it comes in a plain brown wrapper, it's really almost too much if you ask me.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.560]   But I did tell my wife I would like that for Christmas.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   We'll see.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.880]   I would never ever tell my wife that I want to be a Christmas.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.720]   Well, no, if I told my wife I wanted Playboy on a hard drive, I would get a lump of coal.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.400]   This could backfire on you in a serious fashion because of she says, okay, suddenly you've
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.000]   got a new problem on your hands.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.960]   You got something you're going to be thinking about for the next two weeks.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.480]   That was really easy and really fast.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.880]   Yeah, my wife, my wife would give me a lump of coal and say, this is going to have to
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.640]   keep you warm for the next year.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   You got your hard drive.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.960]   What are you bugging me for?
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.840]   I gave you your hard drive.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.800]   You got your little friends.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.000]   Go visit them.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.320]   Hold comfort.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.840]   Oprah's favorite thing.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.680]   Oh, my favorite is an iPad.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.360]   And she loves well, it might have something to do with the concurrent release of the
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.040]   Oprah magazine is an iPad app.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.600]   Just maybe maybe a little bit.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   Well, it's favorite.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.240]   Favorite is a very temporal term.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.440]   You've you've seen the video, haven't you?
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.440]   Of all the all the crazed iPad fanatics?
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.560]   I don't think in the audience.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.560]   Oh, it's pretty fun.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.000]   I know you don't you don't watch Oprah do you?
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   I don't.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   Let me let me.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.760]   Let me also they react the same way when they give them free soap.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.240]   I know it's like free anything.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240]   You want to go candle?
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.240]   Well, you know, you get you also what we're you know, I was on David Letterman.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.400]   I mean, you get coached about you get coached for like two minutes on be excited.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   Gelman.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.600]   It's kind of fun whenever I do a Regis and Kelly.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.440]   I kind of like stand backstage to watch a Michael Gelman's a warm up because it's the
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.760]   same all the time.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760]   So here it is.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   Oprah.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760]   Oprah is announcing.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.120]   I'm like, I'm gonna have to scroll back just a little bit.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.080]   And by the way, the audio on this, I think this guy was it's from iPhone Canada.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.920]   I think he's recording it off his TV set.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.320]   I'm gonna wait a minute.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.360]   I'm gonna keep it off with my number one favorite thing.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360]   But watch this.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   Watch this.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.720]   Oprah's number one favorite thing ever.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.360]   And yeah, the audience is already like out of control.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360]   The idea is so bad.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   The idea is so bad.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:12.840]   The first moment together, I knew it is stolen.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840]   My heart.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840]   Look at the audience.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:25.040]   It's like Jesus Christ himself came from the ceiling and is now blessing them all.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.040]   But you know why?
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.360]   I think they realize that they're all getting an iPad under their seat.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.440]   And I think that's really what the.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.600]   Oprah's running in circles around the iPad, which has angels wings on it.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600]   Angels wings on it.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.840]   I think it's her favorite thing because her app is now again.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.920]   Yeah, it's a pad with wings.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.960]   Look at this woman.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.560]   I think she's I think.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.520]   Words cannot describe what I feel for this magnificent device.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:03.000]   I got to tell you, Apple, you got 90 years to go.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.800]   So what you going to do to top this?
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   I don't know.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.200]   But thanks to my iPad.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.600]   I'm not sure why she gave Apple 90 years to go.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   She was about that too.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.600]   What on earth does that mean?
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.600]   You got 90 years left.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600]   I think it's to be the best of the century.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.600]   I get it.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.600]   I get it.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.600]   Okay.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.600]   I watch news on the iPad.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.600]   I watch movies on the iPad.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600]   I watch TV shows on the iPad.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.600]   Oh, shut up.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.600]   Oh, my.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.760]   Oh, oh, oh, really?
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.760]   Oh, your magazine's on it.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.960]   We have a fantastic album that moves and grows.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.040]   Well, there you go.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.360]   There's another, you know, obviously they believe that this is a very important platform
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.680]   for their magazine as well.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   Martha Stewart has a magazine.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.280]   By the way, this is, I think, one of the reasons that I think it's important for Apple
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.840]   to get way ahead of the making it easier to develop content so that it's develop custom
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.520]   for the iPad because I think that as more people do that, it locks them in more.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   What's your favorite app?
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   From a business.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   Scrabble.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]   Scrabble is fun.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520]   Yeah, but Word with Friends is funner.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   Really?
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.560]   She wouldn't say words with friends though because I have a feeling Milton Bradley or Hasbro
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   or whoever gave her money.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.560]   Don't you think?
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.360]   Does Word with Friends, can you do you have the little iPhone thing where you can throw?
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   No.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   Who cares?
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.360]   I do that all the time with my kids.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.200]   Words with Friends, you play with people on the Internet.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.960]   You don't want to play with people on the Internet.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   Why not?
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   Because I don't know them.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.280]   I want to play with your friends on the Internet.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.840]   Your kids aren't sitting next to you right now.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.320]   You could be playing Scrabble with them right now.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320]   I don't want to.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   My mom.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.000]   I'm old fashioned when I think of Scrabble.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.240]   I think of us all sitting around and drinking hot cocoa and playing Scrabble.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.640]   And reading our paper newspapers on our flip phones.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.920]   I'll be more impressed with that game and it has a special mode where if you shake the
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   iPad, you can do the thing where-
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.320]   Those are good mistakes.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320]   You're cheating.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.280]   That's one of the things I like about Word with Friends is it's the final arbiter of whether
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.840]   that's a good word or not.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.800]   And then frankly, you can't do this in real Scrabble.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.280]   You can try and keep trying words and it'll say, "No, that's not a word."
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.280]   Is that a word?
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280]   No, that's not a word.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.280]   Is that a word?
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.280]   No, that's not a word.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.280]   So you can get, you know, you can get close, you know.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.720]   What I love about the Scrabble for iPad is the fact that you can see all the two letter
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720]   words.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.960]   It's very, very important.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.200]   They'll show you the two letter words.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.600]   Yeah, you can just say, "Show two letter words."
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.200]   It'll show you all the two letter words.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200]   It's one of the-
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200]   That's a-
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:15.200]   That's a-
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   That should be illegal.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   That should be illegal.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   That should be illegal.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   All it'll show you.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   And then after that, you have to just kind of keep on-
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.280]   Because she kicked my butt in words with friends.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.520]   I don't play it anymore.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.680]   She forced me out.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   I was beating-
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.480]   Who was it that had George Bush playing words with friends and he was trying all these-
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   Really?
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.800]   Oh yeah, it was hilarious.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.360]   You know, every word he tried to think of coming back.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   Not a word.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360]   I think that's a joke though, right?
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   Not real.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   It was a joke.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.840]   It was not a joke that George Bush was at Facebook headquarters yesterday getting interviewed
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.680]   by Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.680]   And it was on Facebook Live.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.680]   Oh, I'm so confused.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.680]   I don't know.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]   George W.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.680]   No, I got that.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.680]   I'm just like, he has a new book out.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.680]   I know.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.680]   It just seems like a really odd combination of people to talk to.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.680]   You know, I think what's happening is that the traditional book tour where you go to radio
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.680]   and good morning Muncie and all of that stuff, no, just go to Mountain View, say hi to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   Yeah, they're reedering.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.680]   No, you go to end Markle interview, you're in half a billion people could watch you.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.680]   Yes.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:24.080]   He has his new book, Decision Points, in which he explains that he made no mistakes in the
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.760]   last eight years of his mistakes were not made.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.680]   I meant they were not made made.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   No.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.680]   He explains in detail why every one of them is correct.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   Oh, there you go.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   Apparently, Mark was quite friendly.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.680]   So, you know, we don't know.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.680]   Maybe Mark's a Republican.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.480]   I don't know what his politics are.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.000]   It's kind of an interesting choice.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   But I think what it does show is how mainstream Facebook is, right?
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   What is it?
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.680]   Is it the third or fourth largest country in the world?
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.880]   If it were a country, well, it's got its own monetary system now.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   It does?
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   Facebook dollar?
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.880]   The credits.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.360]   Those credits are going to be a...
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.680]   Yeah, I know you go to 7-11, you can get to that farm.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   That's credit.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   I don't know.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.080]   Well, I mean, but the credits that Facebook is doing is that's the beginning of a global
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   monetary system.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   And one last story, the iPhone baby quilt of the day, and then we're going to get your
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   picks.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.000]   This is from my website called The Daily Want.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.080]   I want this quilt.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080]   I think you should have this quilt.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.080]   Oh, look at that.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.080]   It's an iPhone and the baby likes to Facebook app.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.920]   Don't the baby want to Facebook app or do you want to go over that?
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.880]   I think I have almost all those apps.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.080]   Those are mostly real apps, huh?
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.880]   No, the little dude there, the jelly dude.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   My son plays that.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   That's jelly car, right?
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.080]   Yeah, he plays that like constantly.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.080]   So there's Evernote, which is nice is on there.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080]   He doesn't ever know.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080]   What's the green starter?
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080]   Is that a real one?
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.080]   A little ducky?
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.560]   There's the bicycle, which is great.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.360]   I like that BI.cycle.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.600]   There's Google Earth, Facebook.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.600]   I see those.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.760]   The shapes are.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.000]   And there's the jello.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   The jello guy.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   Jello guy.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   Fish.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.320]   That peekaboo barn is very popular.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   That's real?
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320]   Yes, that's real.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.240]   Is that like replacing busy boxes for kids these days?
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.040]   So they play with it.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.640]   My little grand nephew or nephew, I don't know what the hell he is.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   I don't know.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.720]   Anyway, some kid was at my house, like six months old.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.760]   And I was charged with taking care of him for five minutes.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.760]   So I brought out the iPad, put the cat piano on there.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760]   He was mesmerized.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   Oh, both of the kids.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.920]   My both of my kids love the iPad.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:35.920]   I'm really trying to make sure I manage how much time he spends on it because not that
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.400]   my son would just sit on it all day.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.680]   So really, during the day, I went him out playing.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.920]   I wanted him to do other things.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.080]   But when we were driving up from LA yesterday, he got a little restless.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.600]   I just handed him back an iPad and off he went.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.520]   And the thing is, is that you hand him something that he's watching movies and then he's playing
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.280]   some games, then you hear field runners come on and then you hear.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.480]   So you can hear what he's doing.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.080]   Yeah, you can hear what he's doing.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.880]   Yeah, you can start recognizing.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.720]   The only thing is that he loves to watch the movies from Angry Birds, which takes them
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   to YouTube.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.960]   The next thing we know, F bombs are coming out because he's, you know, once he's in
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   YouTube, it's related.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.320]   I wish you could fix that.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.320]   That's the only thing.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.320]   That's a real problem on YouTube.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.200]   Because I, because it, it, it might, my wife, we should turn off the, they need to because
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.720]   then he could that we're all safe videos like Hooligans where we just all be safe videos
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.120]   and then you could say, Hey, have fun.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.120]   Rock knock yourself out.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.680]   And the kid, you would never have to take care of them anymore.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:30.480]   Because it especially things connected to Angry Birds evidently, there's angry people.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.960]   And then they're yelling angry things and my wife looks at all like, is he really allowed
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   to watch that stuff?
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:43.320]   I listen, I hear stuff coming out of that, that, that, that, what are you listening to?
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.800]   And he was speaking of YouTube.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.240]   Have any of you seen the shopping mall, hallelujah chorus?
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.240]   No.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.080]   Oh, that is, I think it's one of the most priceless things on earth.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.600]   They go to one of these food courts, you know, with all the little fast food places.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:07.240]   And there's hundreds of people sitting in there and suddenly this flash mob who's already
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:12.680]   sitting eating, this woman stands up and starts singing the hallelujah chorus.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:18.520]   And then other people join in and it's, it's, it's a beautiful rendition of the hallelujah
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.760]   chorus and, and the closeups they've got of people's reactions are just fabulous.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.760]   I just love that one.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.000]   I love flash mobs.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.600]   I think we just need to do more flash mobbing in the world.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   All right.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:37.600]   I'll tell you what, I will play that just for you in a minute, but first we have to, we
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.840]   have to do a commercial and then we're going to do, Ray, you could make that your pick
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.120]   of the weekend unless you have another pick of the week.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.800]   Oh, I have a, I have a pick of the week that's really different and important.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.200]   Oh, the audible pick of the week.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.080]   No, no, I mean a regular pick of the week as well as an odd, you don't have to do an
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080]   audible pick of the week.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.160]   Usually we, we, we let Andy do that, but I think you both have audible picks a week.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.960]   So let me give you a little plug for audible first.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Sure.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.280]   Because I'm a big audible fan, so much to the point where I, you know, I have two books
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   a month.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.280]   I have the platinum subscription.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280]   I look forward to long drive.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.440]   I bought three more books for the trip to France because I want, I don't want to be
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.120]   without, I have Steve Martin's new book, which is great.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.320]   I have Keith Wicchitz life.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.120]   Can't wait to hear that.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.120]   And I had to get book five of the dark tower series because I'm almost done with the waste.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.480]   You know, I used to, I used to just barely survive ever reading a book all the way through.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.320]   And now I'm listening to books twice because, oh, I want to listen to that one more time.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.920]   I really enjoy it and let it sink in in ways that I just never did before.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.280]   It's nice, isn't it?
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.320]   It's audible.com/macbreak.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.240]   It's what I do when I'm traveling.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   It's great on an airplane.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   I don't bring movies.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240]   I just listen.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240]   I close my eyes.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.440]   I've got the, you know, the, the, the edomotics that take out all the noise and I am in my
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.600]   own little world listening and I could go, you know, eight hours on a plane.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   No problem.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.920]   In fact, sometimes I wish the flight were longer.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.920]   Anytime I'm commuting at the gym.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.920]   Oh my God.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   It's a lifesaver at the gym.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:03.600]   If you want to try it out, I would encourage you to do so audible.com/macbreak.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:08.360]   That's the website to go to audibleaudible.com/macbreak.

[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.560]   Well, you can cancel anytime.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.680]   So if you get the book, you can cancel the next day and it's, and it's still yours to
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.200]   keep.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.400]   And that's the beauty of it.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.400]   Gold.com/macbreak.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:33.680]   And now Andy Inaco and then after Andy, I'll give you a chance to Ray will give us his
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.280]   pick of the week because Andy's been holding on for so long.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280]   I'm easy.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.280]   I'm mellows.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.360]   He's been holding his pick and I bet he has to go.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   So go.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:48.680]   Oh, well, the book I just finished about three days ago is dangerously funny.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.720]   The uncensored story of these mother's brothers, comedy hour.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.720]   I really want to read that.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.160]   And really great book now, obviously, as the title implies, it's all about the mother's
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.200]   brothers comedy hour.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.080]   You get a little bit of a preface about here's here's who the mothers brothers are here with
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.080]   how to grow up.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.280]   Here's how they develop their musical comedy act, but I've, but the entire thing is all
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:15.200]   about how this show got on the air, how they tried to keep it on the air and then how it
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.280]   finally left the air after three seasons.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.240]   Was it CBS?
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.080]   It was a CBS show.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.520]   And it's a legendary show in the sense that they were fighting the censors every step
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:35.800]   of the way and they finally got thrown off the air in a way that that's smacked of, oh,
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800]   they're selling it.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:41.320]   They're saying things about the government and about the about the squares and the mainstream
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.280]   culture that wasn't wasn't approved.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.240]   And then the CBS finally found a contractual technicality that allowed them to simply not
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.920]   really cancel the show as much as fire everybody and get it off the air.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.600]   But it's more complicated than that because there were a lot of fights between the show
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   and the censors.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.240]   They were saying a lot of things that CBS would rather they did not say because it was
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.920]   been made for a lot of tense things between the show and their advertisers.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.200]   It made for a lot of tense situations between the show and individual affiliates, especially
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.600]   affiliates in the South.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.960]   But it's a what makes it so interesting is it's not a simple case of they were censored
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.520]   off the air by a conservative corporation.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.000]   It was there were so many components to this.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.920]   And a lot of it was you're just sort of slack jawed at Tommy Smothers who really wanted
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.640]   this adversarial relationship with everybody.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.640]   There was no.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.640]   Tommy did.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.280]   Tommy seemed like the nice guy.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.880]   Tommy was see Dick Smothers according to the book.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.160]   Dick Smothers was happy to have a successful show.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.400]   And then when he wasn't doing the show to go out and go dirt bike racing, Tommy was the
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.320]   more ambitious one of the two to the extent that he wanted to produce the entire show
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   and did.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.400]   And every time that Dick tried to like have a more active role, he was really ignored.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.880]   That's why he decided, okay, you know what, I'm going dirt bike racing.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.120]   If I get funny because it was Tommy was like mom always like you bet.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.280]   He was like the sad sack on the show.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.280]   Yeah, absolutely interesting.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.480]   But it was interesting because you do you're listening to this book and you're thinking,
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:19.000]   wait a minute, Tommy, you know that they're really looking for reasons to get at you.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.480]   And what you're doing is that you're intentionally trying to insult these people every single
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   day, every single step of the way.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:31.080]   They've told you that if you have David Steinberg on and you have him do this religious commentary
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.200]   that we've told you not to do before, we're telling you we will not air it.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.080]   And your and your and your show is dropping in the ratings.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.360]   It's not really doing well.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.760]   It could be canceled at any moment just for the just for the point of view that it's not
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.200]   doing exceptionally well.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.440]   And your your choice is that not only you're going to have David Steinberg back on, but
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.280]   you're going to like steal the edited final tape and tell them that you're not going to
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:59.360]   get this until like two hours before the airtime just to make sure you don't edit this.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:05.080]   And that was that was just like the cap of two or three seasons of really interesting interactions.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.440]   So it's definitely a lesson.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:13.120]   And what I found really interesting about it is that it seemed as though if if Tommy
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.640]   Smothers was a little bit was willing to give in a little bit more, not even I'm not even
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.280]   going to color it as a way of he shouldn't have been finding these battles.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.360]   I'm saying that if he decided to pick his battles more carefully, he might have the show
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:29.560]   would have gotten two more seasons, which might have been enough so that with this new management
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:34.760]   and this new the show ended two years before they realized that it doesn't matter that
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.080]   the show is in the middle of the ratings, we are selling it.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080]   We are selling it.
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.360]   It's the show that everybody in the new younger demographic is getting at.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.360]   And so boy, would they have been able to coast for another three or four seasons.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.280]   So it really is a lesson and like how not to win friends and influence people because
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.600]   when push came to shove at the moment when the show needed some friends inside the network
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.000]   who would say, yeah, it's not doing very well.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.880]   And yeah, the next administration might be breathing down our next about this.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:05.840]   And yeah, now there's a new chairman of the FCC who is sort of pushing for more regulation.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.240]   But you know what, we like the show.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.760]   It does important things for CBS and we like working with these people.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   Those people were nowhere to be found when they were needed.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.440]   And that's how the show got canceled.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.240]   But obviously come really complicated situation and the being cool, he makes it into a terrific,
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   terrific story.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.560]   I love the fact that he shows this story from so many different angles.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.680]   It doesn't it doesn't simply there was a documentary a few years ago that didn't like
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.960]   because it really did paint it as you know what they're standing up for liberty and
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:37.200]   speech and first amendment and justice and these corporate bastards and the government
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.920]   is like, well, okay, but really was that all there was to it?
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.320]   Bein Cooley really does point pay the picture that they were victims of censorship and the
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:50.440]   and the network really should have been more open minded, but they were active participants
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:51.440]   in their own demise.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.560]   So I'm adding it to my next lesson right now.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.960]   I can't wait to hear it.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.040]   That sounds really, you know, Tommy Smothers actually is a lives up here.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.840]   He's really yeah, my kids could have school with his kids.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.280]   He's a he's a nice guy.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.040]   They were they're going to move they're going to move the whole show to San Francisco for
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.040]   the fourth season.
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.760]   And as a matter of fact, and that's one of the reasons why.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.680]   He's a winery guy, a winemaker.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.320]   Neat neat very neat guy and and really fun to have around.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.840]   In fact, that was the whole, you know, they they at the school they did Steve Martin's
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:27.640]   play Picasso at lapana Gio and Tommy Smothers son Bo started it.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:31.240]   He was Einstein and we're trying to get Steve up to come see it, but he talked about Oskar
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.800]   as kind of because see, as you know, because Steve wrote for the Smothers brothers, that's
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800]   how he got to start.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.800]   Fascinating story.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   Let me see here.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.240]   Do you want to quickly get one in here, Ray, before we get to our regular picks of the week?
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.240]   Sure.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:51.080]   The audible pick would be seeing in pictures by temple, Brandon.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.080]   You see the documentary?
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.080]   Yes.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.800]   The movie, yeah, the movie, yeah, it is fabulous.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800]   I did see it.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.880]   I recorded it.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.760]   I have a recording of it.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.240]   And it is, it is fabulous.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:15.280]   This is a woman who was autistic and who went on to get a PhD and has been a wonderful
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:23.680]   voice for the autistic community because, you know, she can communicate quite effectively
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.240]   and tell people how an autistic person thinks and she thinks in pictures.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:33.960]   And it's fascinating and the HBO production is equally fascinating.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:38.920]   But this book was actually written by her and takes you through her experiences.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.400]   And it's incredible seeing in pictures.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.080]   Or thinking in pictures, I should say.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   Temple Granddins the latest.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.080]   Well, yeah.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.680]   And it's just and definitely check out if you haven't seen the movie, the dramatization
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.640]   of it with with Claire Danes.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.760]   I could, it took me a half.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.440]   I kept on looking for half the film.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.680]   I kept on looking going, I know who that is and I can't quite figure it out.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.960]   Like I was like, I know who that is.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.360]   And then finally, I was like, it looks a lot like Claire Danes.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.760]   And then, I mean, she just really jumped into that, into that character is amazing.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.760]   Is it thinking in pictures?
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.760]   Is that the one?
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.760]   Yes.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.760]   I think that's it.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.760]   Yes.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.760]   Sorry, I made a mis-rethinking.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.760]   Seeing thinking anyway, it's all there, folks.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, all at audible.com, you can get it right now by going to.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.120]   Well, you have to choose now.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.840]   Audible.com/macbreak, but I'll tell you what next month, get the other one.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.840]   You're going to love Audible.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.240]   It's a great way to listen on your phone, on your iPod, in your car.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.680]   I listen all the time in the car on any, any, almost any device, Android, Apple, Zoom,
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   Kindle.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680]   I love it.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.680]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.680]   Now, it is time for your pick of the week, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.680]   We'll kick it off.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.680]   Check this out.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.160]   Check this out one time.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160]   So you got it.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160]   You got it in your little hands.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.080]   I got, you know, I have a lot of these headphones.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.840]   And many people know that I use the ones that have like lots of flanges, you know, the
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.840]   Edomotic.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.240]   Yeah, that's what I use.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.640]   And of course, the problem is that I really want ones that really fit into my ear, but
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.840]   they're really expensive if you buy them on their own.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.640]   And I wanted it to be for my cell phone.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.840]   And I couldn't find one that someone makes like a custom one for your ear that you can
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.640]   then have it with your cell phone, you know, for your iPhone.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.640]   Right.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.000]   So, oh, they do, I was going to say, because here's the deal.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.680]   There's this company that I ran into at the audio engineering.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680]   Look at that.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.920]   So they poured stuff in your ear there.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.920]   They poured stuff in my ear.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   So that's not ultimate ears.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.920]   That's somebody else?
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.200]   No, this is they're called Ear Incorporated.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.320]   And they are a little company out of, I think, Bolder.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.760]   And that's soft plastic or hard plastic.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.520]   This is this is really rubbery.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.440]   See, because I got the ultimate ears and it was hard plastic and it hurts my ear.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440]   I don't use it.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:50.280]   I spent like $500 for I went to an audiologist got the mold made the whole thing.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.600]   And then I can't work because it's hard.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600]   It's really soft.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.480]   And that fits perfectly in your ear because it's molded to your ear.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.560]   And so, and here's the deal though, is if you already have headphones that you like, like
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.240]   I had these shurs that I really liked and they, and, and I wanted to use them.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.240]   How many ear will do that too?
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.600]   That's a existing phone.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.680]   So it cost me a hundred and ten bucks.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.880]   To have these done and they sent me the mold.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.240]   So if I want more, I can send them in like, I don't have to do the mold again.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.000]   Now I have a mold that is my ear, as long as I don't grow anymore, which I don't think
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   I'm going to.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.960]   You know, I, I, I now have these that, and they're like, you know, and, and they really, I
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.400]   mean, they really become part of your ear.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.880]   They drop the sound going in by about 30 dB, which is really.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   They drop it.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.040]   The sound, the external sound when you, when you stick them in your ears about a 30 dB
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.040]   drop.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.160]   And with the edimodics that I have, I think that they measured out at about 20 to 22.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.720]   So it's a fair bit more control.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.960]   And you can, you can still pop them off and put the other ones in, but I don't want to
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.720]   take them off because I really like them.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.240]   So it's an overlay, in other words, it goes on the edimodics driver.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.120]   Well, this one goes on my shirt.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.360]   So what happens is I sent them, I sent them the headphones.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.480]   Oh, and they just molded it with the mold and they made it, they made it custom.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   You can take it off.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.480]   You can take it off.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   I can't take it off.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   I don't want it because I don't want to, I don't want it to get loose.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.080]   I want it to stay nice and nice and, but you could take it off and put the old ones back
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.480]   on and just keep these as inserts.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:16.800]   So they, yeah, they customize it specifically for the, you know, specifically for whatever
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   headphone that you have.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.840]   So if you already have headphones that you like, you already spent some money on, you're
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.320]   only paying for the inserts, you're not paying for the drivers and everything.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320]   They'll make them too.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   They make these as well.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.080]   They make hearing aids and, you know, custom stuff and everything else, but for $110 to
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.080]   have them, you know, build this custom mold for my ear, because I, you know, you had
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.120]   talked about it and I spent $500, of course.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.120]   And it was hard.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.120]   It was hard.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   I can't.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.200]   But, but did you get the fancy box with your name on it?
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.400]   I didn't get a fancy box.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   See, that's what I paid for.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:47.840]   I got a nice, I got a really nice little soft case for it.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.840]   You know, it's funny.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.840]   I like a lot.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.480]   I've got the fancy box with my name on it.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.880]   I save that, but I don't know where the headphones.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.080]   It's a great box.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.520]   That's my $500 empty box.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.520]   Not that he's bitter.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520]   They were hard.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:03.520]   I don't know.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.000]   See, I put these in.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   I was worried about worry about that.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   Ultimate ears is weird.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.600]   You know, bottle wears in all the musicians, but I wanted that.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   Because that's what I'd had before.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.880]   And they have crazy colors.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.400]   And I mean, you can really choose like a thousand different, you know, you know, all
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.400]   these different colors.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.240]   And again, you can do them for your, yeah, for your, somebody stole mine, but the joke's
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:22.160]   on them because it's not going to fit them.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.160]   Exactly.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   It's not, doesn't really work.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.080]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   That's a good deal.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.080]   So you're incorporated.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.080]   You're incorporated.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.320]   Well, that's where I'm going next.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320]   You're in dot.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.360]   And I could just put it in the ultimate ears box.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360]   And then everybody will be happy.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   Exactly.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.680]   Everyone will think that except for the guys at your incorporated and they'll be like,
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.680]   what is it?
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:42.680]   Ultimate ears box.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.680]   Great.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   We man your nice ears.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.680]   And they will make them.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.680]   You can say I want, I want, you can have them all custom made and then that's going
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.520]   to get you into the 500 or 800 thousand.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   Went to an all the audiologist.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.520]   They did the whole thing.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.520]   Right.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.040]   And then it didn't fit.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.920]   So I went back to the audiologist and he said, Oh, yeah, we didn't give you the tongue
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.920]   depressor.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.280]   I just talked because we actually, so on, if you want to, because your ears have a different
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.680]   shape when your mouth is open.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680]   Right.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.880]   And so you want to fit that when they were when they were putting the mold in, I thought
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.120]   that he was actually getting some into my jaw.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.040]   I mean, it was, it was really deep.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.040]   But the shot of it.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.040]   Does it makes you gag?
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.440]   Doesn't in the next week or two will have a video of me getting the mold on gear, midi
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440]   attack.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440]   So if you go to TV, you'll see it.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440]   That'll be exciting.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.360]   A little syringe and.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.560]   Now it's time for another pick.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.400]   This one from Mr. Ray Maxwell, right?
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.360]   Well, my pick of the week this week is a topaz.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.640]   You know, I'm a big fan of topaz filters.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.960]   Well, they've released a new filter.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.560]   They notified me about this week.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.960]   And of course I ran out and tried it out because you can download it.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.960]   Timing folks.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.520]   So I'm going to go to the topaz filters and this filter is called in focus.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.800]   This is a Photoshop, Lightroom, et cetera filter.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.120]   And it is very interesting.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.200]   You know, there have been tons of so called sharpening filters.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.840]   And basically what a sharpening filter does is it looks at an image and anywhere there's
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.080]   a sudden transition from light to dark.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.640]   What it will do is it will emphasize that transition.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:29.560]   It will make the area around the transition, the dark part darker, the light part lighter.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.680]   And that gives you the illusion of the additional sharpness.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.440]   Now this in focus filter has a sharpening adjustment that does exactly that, but it
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.000]   has something else that's very, very different.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.720]   When your image is blurred because of your lens or because of motion, it is in mathematics.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   It's doing what's known as a convolution.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.720]   And so they have a mathematical algorithm that does deconvolution.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:05.920]   And so it will make a sharper.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.120]   And it's pretty incredible.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   I mean, they have an out of focus picture of a kid coming out and it looks like it's
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.120]   in focus now.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.040]   So you could actually, are you saying you could save a focus out of focus picture?
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.160]   If it's not too far, I found that it does have its limits.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.240]   It won't do absolute magic.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.200]   But if you're slightly out of focus from...
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.040]   This is totally like CSI.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.040]   It is.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.560]   And it's on sale by the way for 30 bucks right now.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.880]   Oh my goodness.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:41.000]   But it is a D it will correct focus, not just put in sharpening.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.560]   You know, in other words, overshooting.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560]   Can you do that so many things?
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.440]   Well, I could do that in Photoshop.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.440]   Can you do that in Photoshop?
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.600]   No, you cannot.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.760]   You can sharpen in Photoshop.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.040]   And that is doing just what I described.
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:42:00.280]   It's making it ring, it overshoot, anywhere there's a transition from dark to light or
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   light to dark.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:07.640]   But this actually does not have to do that trick to make the image sharper.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.120]   You know, if nothing else, this tells me, because a lot of times I'll go through when
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:14.560]   I get a rollback in Lightroom and I'll delete it.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.880]   If it's pictures out of focus, even if it's a great shot in the compositions, great,
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.080]   and it's just slightly blurry, I'll throw it out.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.760]   Well, even if I'm not going to buy this, I think there's a message here.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.320]   You know, times change.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.520]   You can do things down the road.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.080]   I just thought there's no way you could fix that.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.080]   Right.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.600]   Not only that, is this will increase your depth of field as well?
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   Wow.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.600]   TopazLabs.com in focus.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.520]   30 bucks right now.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:38.520]   Did you have a question, Andy?
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.520]   Oh, right.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.040]   I was just going to ask, does it matter whether it's out of focus because of being out of focus
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.800]   or does motion blur?
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.920]   Like, will it put anything in focus?
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.120]   You tell it which it is and it will do the mathematical algorithm for either.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.040]   That's pretty incredible.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.480]   I've been going through like a few hundred shots I took at New York Comic Con a couple
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.480]   months ago.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.440]   And some, if I threw out a shot, it's because it's really, really dim in there.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.880]   I had to use like one 20th of a second, shot it for just about everything.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.720]   And it's just enough out of focus to saying, no, it's not in focus.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.720]   I can't use that one.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.720]   Isn't that?
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   It's a hard break.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Okay.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   You're getting 30 bucks out of me.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   So it's, you're already there.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.920]   You can try it for 30 days and it doesn't limit how, you know, you can actually use it
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.120]   the full up version for 30 days for free.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120]   Great.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120]   So download it and try it.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:31.520]   If it doesn't do what you want it to do, don't buy it.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520]   Great.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.120]   I'm so totally dot-loading this.
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.120]   Oh my God.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:40.080]   I kind of wish we had saved Ray for the last tip actually because nine looks like a piece
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.080]   of crap.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:46.080]   You're talking.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:54.160]   Mine is now, see, I normally don't review cases because I mean, for God's sakes, it's
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.600]   a pouch pouch made out of leather with a strap and pocket.
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.600]   Same philosophy.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600]   Yep.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600]   Your device in it and carried around.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.360]   But then some, you know, every now and then, like someone will send me a press release or
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.480]   just like an email about this new case they've built.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.720]   And it seems interesting enough.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.720]   I said, okay, fine.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.720]   Send me one.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.720]   And then I'm like, okay, this is a pretty good case.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.720]   I think I want to tell people better because it's a good case.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.240]   It's a, it's a, it's a unique case for the MacBook Pro, both the, both the smaller the
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:27.080]   larger size and it is carved out of a slip case.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.680]   It's a wooden pouch.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.680]   Exactly.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.320]   It's like, if you went to like a library in 1953, they let you use one of their notebooks.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.560]   It's like this is what it would be in.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.560]   It is so cool.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.840]   It is just, it is just a oak slip case made out of like with hand rub like tongue oil.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.020]   The instructions say to clean it, just, you know, use furniture, furniture polish and
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.600]   furniture wax on it.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.840]   Now you'll notice that it doesn't have like mounting points for like any sort of like,
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.560]   you know, like shoulder straps or anything.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.440]   It really is just a slip case, but oh my God, it is so cool.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.480]   And you snap it.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.840]   It's slight, your computer slides out really nicely.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.440]   It's lined and felt.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.680]   So it's not, it'll be nicely protected.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:17.520]   When you put it back together, it snaps with a lovely reassuring snap like that.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:20.960]   So when you walk into the meeting with this tucked under your arm, you will be doing so
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.360]   a certain amount of authority, I think.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.840]   And it's not dirt cheap, but it's not, it's not stupid expensive.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.640]   It's like 129 bucks, I think.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.520]   This is the 15 inch model that I have right here.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.920]   And this is, this is clearly like guys, folks are like having an interesting business model.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:45.440]   It drives in a burlap sack in a nicely fitted cardboard box with a, a, a, congratulations
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.840]   on welcome to the, welcome to the family of black box case owners.
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.440]   But I, and you're normally just sort of tosses aside, but I took a look at it.
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.760]   My God, you hit you.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.240]   There's no way you can really see this, but this is like a fully like letter press done
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.240]   card.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.360]   I'm sure you won't be able to see it, but like it is a letter, the entire beautiful letter
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.360]   press.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.920]   Well, they might as well, you know, these.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:13.880]   So yeah, so these people are really interested in making pretty and interesting things.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.880]   Nuts.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.200]   They're nuts, but before they have fun doing it, they're crafty nuts.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.200]   Exactly.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.520]   They're, they're, they're, they're, they're Mary pranksters.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.400]   They're Mary monsters.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:30.520]   And so, as I said, this is especially for like this, like November, December, because this
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.640]   is might not be the sort of thing that you would buy for yourself.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.800]   But when you see a picture of this, you're like, I hope that someone thinks enough of
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.600]   me to buy this for me for Christmas, because I think it's really, really pretty.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.000]   And I would like to own one of these.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.680]   So you can go to black box case.com and order these.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:51.200]   They're not available for every single model of, of Mac book out there.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:56.000]   Right now, it's just the Mac, the two Mac book pros that are, that's available for.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.520]   But really, if you, if you were, if you were holding this in your hand, I mean, it just
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:01.880]   is a lovely thing.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:06.560]   Just even just as a, it has a couple of bumpers at the bottom here.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.360]   So clearly it's kind of designed so that I think that you would want to like leave this
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.240]   on the corner of your desk so that people can draw really good conclusions about the
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.880]   sort of person you are and what kind of case you're very woody.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.880]   Exactly.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.520]   And I'm an earthy sort of person.
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.760]   I'm technologically oriented, but still I appreciate the classic finer things such as
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.320]   hand-built craftsmen.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.480]   The strap as a matter of fact is fine Corinthian leather hand-tanned by a Tuscan method that
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.360]   has been folded just since the 1870s, but very few people would appreciate that sort
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.080]   of coldering, which it said.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.880]   Oh, Roth, Roth, Roth, Roth, Roth.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.040]   Oh, Sherry, Roth, Sherry, I think.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.200]   Yes.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:48.240]   My, if I pick is a book, it's kind of boring.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.560]   I almost don't want to do it.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.560]   It's kind of--
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:52.560]   We love you, Leo.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.880]   Yeah, it's kind of dull.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:54.880]   Kind of dull.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:01.200]   I am a big fan of Ruby, which is a programming language that is just very elegant and beautiful
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.440]   and it's being used quite frequently these days in web programming.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:12.520]   Ruby on Rails kind of did that from David Hennemier Hanson, who was at 37 signals.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.840]   So if you're doing web programming, it's great.
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.840]   But Ruby is great on the Mac.
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:18.800]   In fact, the Mac comes with Ruby installed, it comes with an older version of Ruby installed.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.200]   The current version of Ruby these days is 1.9.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:31.560]   And there is a classic Ruby book called Programming Ruby from pragmatic programmers.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:32.560]   It's probably the--
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.560]   They call it pickax.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.680]   It's kind of one of the definitive Ruby books.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.800]   And because it's the 10th anniversary of Ruby, they're offering it for $10.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:42.800]   Right now, there's a thick-ass book with--
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.160]   I mean, it really is.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.520]   It's like three inches thick.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.600]   It's fantastic.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.440]   And I have to say, it is if you're learning Ruby a fantastic way to do that.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.240]   I know Alex, you're kind of into programming.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.720]   And I think that they do eBooks.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:56.720]   They do eBooks.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.720]   They do ePub or--
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.360]   They have all the formats, ePub, PDF or Moby, if you want to put it on the Kindle.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.880]   ePub for the iPad.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:08.040]   They do great books and they're really cost effective.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.880]   I mean, you get a real good value with what they're doing.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.400]   Well, and as I said, I typically will buy the book in electronic form, which I have.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:20.040]   But $10 for the print edition is like 100%.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.280]   It's a $50 book.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:25.720]   So if you're interested in Ruby and you want to use the new Ruby, this is-- I already
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.720]   ordered it.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720]   It should come in the next couple of days.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.720]   It's a great deal.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.640]   But this is a great company to know about.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.160]   They write some of the best programming books out there, the pragmatic bookshelf.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.800]   And I know you have the Aaron Heligas book on programming for the iPhone.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.000]   You know, one of the things you can do with Ruby is AppleScript.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.440]   There's an OSA library so that you can-- instead of writing an AppleScript, which I find kind
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.200]   of opaque and weird, they tried too much to be English.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.360]   Ruby is just a very great programming language.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.160]   It just gets out of the way and I like it a lot.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.160]   I agree with you.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:00.200]   I took a couple of-- one of the keynote presenters at the Mac Tech Conference was talking about--
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.560]   it was one of the lead people, I think, on Mac Ruby.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.480]   And he was just giving a really good walk through demo of why it makes so much sense
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.640]   to do a lot of your AppleScript stuff in Ruby.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.640]   Yes.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.280]   Not only because of what you're talking about, where I love AppleScript and I use it all the
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:18.640]   time, but there's so many times where you think that, you know what, instead of letting
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.240]   me write an English sentence like the name of the folder that is selected, why don't
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.560]   you just tell me what words are important because I'm going to get tripped up in three
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:29.480]   months' time when it turns out that the is causing the interpreter to screw up.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.480]   Right.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.340]   But yeah, I mean, the things you can do with Ruby, it was such an interesting demo that
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.620]   I sat in on two other sessions just to learn more about it.
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.720]   I've been learning bits and pieces of it ever since.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:41.420]   It's an easy language to learn because it really gets-- it's just very straightforward.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.420]   There's no semicolons.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.220]   No, white space doesn't matter.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.780]   None of the things that, you know, the Python can drive people crazy with white space.
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.020]   Pearl could drive people crazy with semicolons.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.740]   Plus, there's so many modules you can load in that.
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:58.580]   It's a little bit like Automator in the sense that before you start writing the module,
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:07.580]   it's going to turn a-- take a joke, JPEG, and turn it to a 240 pixel Lomo-vigneted picture.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:10.340]   Like, before you do that yourself, gee, I wonder if someone's already done that and
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:12.780]   you find a library that, oh, there's Lomo 4.0.
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:13.780]   Okay, good.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.780]   Just one line of include, then suddenly one line in your description actually.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:17.780]   Right.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:18.780]   Right.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.780]   I like-- it's nice, isn't it?
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.180]   Anyway, just a little plug for Ruby and a good book to get.
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:23.180]   There are a lot of great Ruby books.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:25.700]   And in fact, there's a lot of online documentation that's free.
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.420]   You probably don't need to spend a lot of money for that.
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.860]   But I love Ruby.
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:30.860]   I love Rails.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:33.180]   And this is a great way to start.
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:34.500]   That's our-- those are our picks.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.980]   I want to thank you, Ray Maxwell, for joining us this week.
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:37.980]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.540]   We'll have you back very soon.
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:40.620]   My pleasure.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:43.020]   I guess you don't do any hang gliding in the winter.
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.340]   No, I'm flying my RC helicopter in the winter.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:48.140]   Hang gliding, not hang gliding, gliding, gliding.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:49.140]   Gliding, gliding, gliding.
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:50.140]   You're not hanging from the glider.
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.140]   Soaring.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:52.140]   He's soaring.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.140]   You're soaring.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:54.140]   Yes.
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.140]   Thank you for being here.
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:58.220]   Ray Maxwell is @ColorGuy on Twitter if you'd like to follow him.
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:01.700]   You can see his little remote control right behind him, as a matter of fact, over his
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.260]   right shoulder there.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.700]   So many switches, multiple many tunnels.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:08.060]   What does this one do?
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.620]   That's the thing I want to lick Leo.
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:10.620]   Raise a grid.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.620]   Yeah, really.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620]   On a great fire.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.620]   On a great fire.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.620]   On a great fire.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:15.620]   On a great fire.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.620]   For two, you ever put a camera up there with a helicopter?
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:17.620]   Oh, yes.
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:18.620]   Oh, man.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:19.620]   The aerial shots.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:22.860]   There's a video I saw of, you know, that stable platform with the four props.
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:23.860]   Parrot.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:24.860]   Parrot.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:29.620]   And they put a 5D on it and put video shot video.
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:33.020]   And they actually put that on a parrot or do they put it on something like a parrot?
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.020]   Like a parrot.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:35.020]   Like a parrot.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:37.020]   Parrot like.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.020]   That particular version costs $15,000.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:39.020]   Okay, a little, yeah.
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:42.500]   Well, if you're going to put your Canon 5D on it, it better damn well work.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.140]   You know, you don't want any like accidental slippage.
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.980]   It was an Alex Lindsey toy.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.980]   And but you saw those shots that they got, right?
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:50.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:51.980]   Terrific.
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:52.980]   Amazing.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:53.980]   I don't know.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:54.980]   Amazing.
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:56.980]   They're down in Southern California.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.980]   We should get them to come here.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.500]   The parrot people or the guys that did the 5D shot.
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:03.140]   Yeah, they were talking, we were talking about it on twi.
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:08.340]   And they were, I got an email from them saying, Hey, you know, come up and visit us sometime.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:11.980]   We are, we're, Lisa Betting out are going to launch a camera show soon, probably after
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:12.980]   a CES.
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:13.980]   Let us know if we can help.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:16.260]   We love your help and we have a lot of great people who are going to be involved in Ray.
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.380]   I know Ray's going to be part of it because he's going to explain stuff within the new
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:20.380]   studio.
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:21.380]   It's going to be, we're going to have a lot of stuff.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:23.780]   That's one of the reasons we're going to do is because we can now do it right in the
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:24.780]   new studio.
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:25.780]   And so we're really looking forward to that.
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:29.060]   You know why, you know why I figured how we could do this is that every photographer
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:30.740]   now wants to do video.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:34.220]   So we're just going to have people like Trey Radcliffe and Michael Oland and Derek Street
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:39.500]   and Derek Story and all the great photographers that I know shoot their own segments.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.300]   Just send it.
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.020]   You know, Ray just shoot it and send it to us.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:44.020]   We'll do it, right?
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.020]   You got the gear.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:47.020]   That's right.
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.060]   You know, who else is a fan strobeist?
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:50.060]   Yep.
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:51.580]   And I'd love to do some strobeist stuff.
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:52.580]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:56.100]   There's going to be a fun show where we, Lisa and I will introduce segments from some of
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:59.300]   the most interesting people out there and they'll do their little five minutes and it'll
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.300]   be really fun.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.300]   I can't wait to do that.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.300]   It's not going to be like Twip.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.300]   It's going to be a how-to show.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:06.140]   Twip is for enthusiasts talking about it.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.100]   Well, we're going to be, yeah, we're going to be doing more.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.260]   The new studio up here means that we'll be doing a lot more video for Twip as well,
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:13.740]   but I'm sure that there's ways that both of these are going to be able to dovetail
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.940]   into each other fairly cleanly.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:17.180]   So it'll be good.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.380]   Now I'm looking at maybe the $10 sale is over for the 10th anniversary of Ruby.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:23.340]   I hope that that's not the case because that's how much I paid, but maybe they've gone back
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.860]   to the full price.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.820]   If that's the case, I'm sorry, I teased you.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:29.420]   But I am glad you watched the show.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:31.500]   They just watch the show and they're like, "Turn that off.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   Turn that off."
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.500]   Alex, yeah, yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.660]   They don't want to send $5,000 of the $10 each.
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.140]   Alex Lindsey is at PixelCore.com.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:41.220]   Gugo there, whenever there's a stream, it's fun to watch.
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:42.460]   Alex do his crazy work.
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:45.180]   Yeah, we're having, we're going to be doing more and more streams.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:48.100]   We're really starting to get a hang of how to use, how to build this streaming system
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:50.700]   anywhere with our mixer and everything else.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:51.700]   So, definitely.
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.420]   Follow him on Twitter @AlexLindsay or follow PixelCore@PixelCore and you'll get tweeted
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:57.540]   when there's another stream at PixelCore.com.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:00.500]   It's a great place to go if you want to join that guild of multimedia artists who are doing
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.900]   such interesting stuff.
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:08.700]   Mr. Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun Times where he writes the best stuff ever.
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.340]   He is the guy.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.340]   He's the guy.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:15.580]   There's others except no substitutes.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.300]   He is the guy.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.500]   You can also go to the Inako symbol of quality.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.660]   Yeah, you're not, that I like it.
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:25.860]   You can also go to his website www.cwob.com for more.
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:29.460]   Having, oh, by the way, I've just been informed that I'm having some issues with people accessing
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:30.460]   cwob.com.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:35.100]   In the meantime, try to spell my last name correctly, Inako.com and you won't get them
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.700]   to, I blog directly.
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:40.900]   You know, Andy doesn't really want you to read his blog, so he's made it this difficult.
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:44.100]   I just want to make sure you're really serious about wanting to put my blog.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.900]   You have to want to.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:49.420]   Here's the trick to, and this is what I use every time I spell Andy's name, the first
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:54.100]   three letters, I have no idea how to spell this thing.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.260]   That'll get you, that'll get you far enough that you can do the rest.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:57.260]   IH and ATK.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:58.820]   Yeah, it's a good one.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:02.420]   He's also at Inako on Twitter.
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:08.980]   And parents, when you have a child, consider spellability, usability, availability of the
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:12.180]   domain and Twitter handle before you name that child.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:16.940]   I would like to be a right-hand candidate.
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:17.940]   That's true.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.420]   Did she win?
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.420]   Murkowski?
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:21.420]   I don't know.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.420]   She's like, I don't know.
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.420]   They're still counting.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:27.460]   They finally just certified the election in California, the Secretary of State, like
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:31.780]   a month later, because it was so close.
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.580]   Andy, Alex, Ray, thanks for joining us.
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:35.580]   Thank you for being here.
[01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:37.380]   Now you get back to, do I have anything else to say?
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:38.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:43.380]   We're just best of to participate in our best of, because we, at the end of, after the,
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:46.620]   you know, the week after Christmas, we don't want to have to, you know, do all that work.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.780]   Next week, you're going to be hosting the show.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.780]   I'm not hosting.
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:50.780]   You're not going to be here.
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:51.780]   I'm not going to be here.
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.140]   Next week, Andy's going to be hosting the show.
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.820]   I am assembling an All Star panel, or at least All Stories in my mind.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.820]   Oh, that's good.
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:00.820]   So it'll be kind of a different style of Mac break weekly.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:01.820]   With action, actually.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:04.260]   Again, it's going to be a theater in the round, all acoustic.
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.780]   We're going to do some stuff from the new album, but some of the classics are just going
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.380]   to keep the fans happy.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.980]   You're going to want to watch that next Tuesday.
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.900]   I'll be a Paris at Loub.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:17.900]   We will be broadcasting that live at this 9 a.m. on Wednesday, a week from Wednesday.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:20.220]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.220]   Thank you all for joining us now.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.220]   You all get back.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.820]   Now get back to work as break time is up.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:28.700]   All right, let's start.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:35.700]   I even saved my I'm a geek and I vote.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:41.220]   Cut this segment out.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:48.700]   All in all, it's just another damn rat hole.
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:52.780]   You know, I'm going to see that with jammer be is such a God.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:56.780]   Not only did he save all our lower thirds.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:59.860]   He's taken me to see the wall on Friday.
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:02.220]   Where's the wall?
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.780]   We're going to Oakland.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.580]   He's Roger Waters.
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:10.820]   I hear he was in a group called Pink Floyd.
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.820]   It's the Pink Floyd.
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:13.820]   The Pink Floyd.
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.900]   Is it really the Pink Floyd?
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.260]   No, I was just going to say.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:25.260]   You can instantly sound unhipped on any concept by saying, I saw a movie called The Spider
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.660]   Man last week and I normally don't go for that.
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:29.140]   But boy.
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:32.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:35.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.940]   (rock music)
