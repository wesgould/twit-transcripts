[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   We couldn't do it without it.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show where we
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   cover all things Macintosh, including...
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   The new X-Serve.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I guess.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   On the line with us from London, England, where he's
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   at some sort of conference in the middle of
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   nowhere, but there are lots of neat cranes, Mr.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Hello.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And I'm not talking cranes in the mist.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Well, I mean, I am.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   What's the mist like out there?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Oh, there's no mist right now.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   There is in the morning.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Alex, you should take a picture of cranes in the mist.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I should.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Okay, tomorrow morning.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I have some that...
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Tomorrow morning, I'll take some cranes in the mist.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And then I'll...
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We can substitute that for my cranes in the fire mist shot.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, maybe if you light a flame under, you could have a
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   fire mist even.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It could be the whole...
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, there's a real industrial beauty to them.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I guess they just left them here and it is...
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   They're just...
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I took a lot of photos of them as reference.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   These are old dock loading cranes or...
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, they're dock loading cranes and they are just
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   massive.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Cool.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And they're just all the way down the river.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   By the way, Scott Borne is also here.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Good to have you back, Scott, after your massive DNS attack.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It was actually a...
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Distributed denial of service...
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   A DDoS attack on my host, GoGrid, that took down 50% of their
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   clients.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So they find out why they were attacking GoGrid?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I don't know, but my haters like to think it's because I
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   happen to host there, but I think that's more credit than I
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   deserve.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But it was nasty and I've been dealing with it all week,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   frankly.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Wow.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Between that...
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Did it hurt your system?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean, it took us down completely.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So did you have to rebuild or...?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We had a backup at 2am the night before, so we only lost
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   a couple of posts and some comments.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   But other than that, we're fine.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Because we do back up here.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It was nasty, though.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I mean, just reconfiguring took a long time.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And then, of course, I'm in the middle of a 30-day-long
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   IRS audit while that's going on.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's just...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm thinking of just completely advocating my responsibilities
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   next week and flying to Hawaii.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Can I join you?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I would like to have to kid right now.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Drobo sends me the only Drobo Pro in the world, other than
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   the ones they have at the trade show, on April 1st,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   overnight.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's supposed to be here April 2nd.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Oh, no.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It didn't get there?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   They sent it to Alaska by mistake because clearly,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Alaska and Gig Harbor are right next to each other.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Sort of like Russia and Alaska.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Anyway...
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It just showed up this morning, so that takes the pressure off.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So I have the only Drobo Pro in the world right here.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Hey, we're going to get to...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is the hardware episode.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Several big hardware announcements from Apple and others.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   In just a second, before we do, though, I want to mention,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   go to meeting.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Go to meeting for my friends at Citrix.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   When you meet with clients and colleagues, there's the new way
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and there's the old way.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You know the old way.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Over the phone.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Boring, unproductive.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Not very effective.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There's always some guy answering his email in the background there.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Or you meet in person.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Well, and that's time consuming.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You've got to travel to the...
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Whether it's driving across town or flying across the country for the
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   meeting.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's just tough.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Old way over.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   New way to meet online with go to meeting.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Go to meeting.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's just like meeting in person.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Costless takes less time.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You're more productive.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's more engaging.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And frankly, somebody like me, I can't get out of here.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I've got to do it this way.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I've become a huge fan of go to meeting.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You start your meetings with just a click of the mouse.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Everyone sees your computer desktop on their computer screen.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And by the way, good news now.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   You can host a meeting on Windows, as always, but also now on a Mac.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You've always been able to join a meeting on a Mac, but now you can host as well.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's incredible whether you're using your keynote or you're going to web pages
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   or you're collaborating, you're typing together or training.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Sales presentation, product demos, it's incredible.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I want you to try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Here's what you do.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And you're going to love this thing.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Try it free for 30 days of unlimited online meetings.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Then you let me know what you think.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Go to meeting.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's the best, the new and better way to meet with clients and colleagues online.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Well, this is going to be kind of a hardware episode because we've got that new Drobo Pro.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We've got the new X-Sir, Apple's website.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   The store went down this morning, very early in the morning.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I was online.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I don't know why I was up so early.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And Don McAllister said, "The store's down.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The store's down."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And, you know, that could be exciting.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I was just going, "Shh, they did it before our show.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   They did it before our show."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And as it turned out, not as exciting.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It was X-Serves and a new--
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   What do you call it?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Time capsule.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Time capsule.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Time capsule.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And you're excited, Alex Lindsey, about the new one.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We're getting really close to getting ready to--
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   These are the Halem X-Serves.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yeah, well, I mean, you know, we just need a rack-mountable solution to rendering, you know?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And we've been waiting because, you know, we knew that they were coming, eventually.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Are these much faster than the old ones?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I think it would be a lot faster.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   For what we do, we see the thing is that our stuff hits these processors and hits the memory
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   architecture as hard as you can hit it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And so everything is slowed down by--
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   If any of that stuff goes out of whack.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And so, you know, this is big news for us because that's exactly what we need.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And now I have to persuade my CFO and to let me buy them.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah, your CFO is a wife, by the way.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   My CFO is a wife.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So now I have to just persuade her to free up.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And I, of course, I configured one.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And, you know, our version of it is about $8,000.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So I'm going to ask this, and I'm not going to want to hear the answer, but I have to anyway.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   You know that Mac Pro I just bought?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Yeah, I didn't want to tell you that.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I should have bought that.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That is because this is really what I needed.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's what this is built for.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It's built for what you're using that big Mac Pro for.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You don't want to see a gromancry, do you?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That would have been a cry.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Well, I guess I have a nice Mac Pro that someday I guess I could use.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Yeah, I mean, the thing is, but that's exactly what these are designed for us to do.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Those heavy processing.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   You know, for us, we have, you know, we're, for instance, we're converting after shooting
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   on a red for the last two days, you know, we're going to convert, you know, eight or nine
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   hours of red footage.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And that's going to, you know, that'll take a regular computer 40 hours.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It'll take this one, you know, this being a little bit more efficient is going to take
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   25 hours, you know.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So run us through the specs real quick.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, you know, the specs look a lot like the--
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   The Pro that I just bought.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah, they basically what it is is it's a Mac Pro without a lot of the, you know, without
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   the stuff that you would need if you were going to be, you know, using it.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So you're going to have--
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's not me.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Well, I mean, if you're going to use it, it's without all the stuff that you would need
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   for, you know, having it, you know, with a lot of the cards and the other things that you
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   would need for you to be able to do.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And then you're going to have to do it.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Well, we're actually looking at the code.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Do you put a grade card in there?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Or do you use the on-board SAS controller?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I think we use the on-board SAS controller, you know, for what we're doing here.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   But we may go to the-- you know, we have some raids, but we're trying to figure out how we're going to--
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Right.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   What we're going to do with that.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Now, here's my question.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   It says you could put three 1-terabyte drives.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   They don't go bigger than a terabyte.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well, that's what you're going to order from Apple.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I think you could get--
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Oh.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   This is just what they're making available.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You're not limited to one terabyte drives.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   You just have to-- that's all that they make available to you.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I am.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   OK.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Two easy net.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   But no, I like this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It has a mini display port, but I guess there's really not any video card in it, particularly.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   What's the video?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   No, it's not going to be particularly fast.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I mean, you will be able to put video out.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You could hook it to video.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I mean, I believe you can hook it to video.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   The--
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Or is it completely headless?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It might be completely headless.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I don't think it's headless.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I am not 100% sure of that.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   No, no, yeah.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Oh, it's built in--
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Oh, it has the same one I got.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Jeez.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   The GT120, which is a piece of junk.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Yeah, so it is a--
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Why are you laughing at me born?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I just, you know, I just--
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I laughed at me born.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   As soon as I saw the press release on this, I thought to myself,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I know what's going to come next.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   God.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You know, how can they bite me twice?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Because I bought the bad--
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I bought the previous server on a Friday, and they released the new one on a Monday.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   But that--
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Oh, whoo, whoo, whoo, put on the brakes, got the new one,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and then they--
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   See, that was just like a faint, and then the jab.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It was a head fake.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It was just a head fake.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   They're like, duck and weave, and then boom, they hit you.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Not that I would have saved any money.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I mean, this is the same price as far as I can do.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And, you know--
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And that'll do the same thing.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's just--
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   For us, it's just a form factor.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Yeah, and also just, you don't want to tie up floor space and--
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Mine's like--
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Right over here.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It's like the tower from 2001, a space odyssey, the Sentinel.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I'm just waiting for a chimpanzee to hit it with a bone.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I mean, because when you think about it, this is like effectively with the hyper-threading,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   effectively if an application and a lot of our applications can take advantage of it,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   will look like 16 processors.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And so if we throw--
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Let's say we get five of these things over the next year, that'll be like having 90 or 80 processors.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You know, that's--
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And that means--
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Do you use X-grid?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Is that how you do the rendering?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It depends on the application.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So usually what we're using is there's just a Q-Master and a lot of the stuff that's set up.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   A lot of these compressor and then a lot of these other applications have their own way of managing it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So if we're rendering out a Moto or a Cinema 4D or a lot of these other apps,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   you put clients on all the computers and then they--the clients suck up all of them individually and send it back.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So it just depends on whether we're doing 3D or whether we're doing compression.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   To be honest, the biggest thing we need this for is compressing files for clients back down to either Flash or H.264 for the web.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You know, it's just--we produce--for clients, we produce between 40 and 80 episodes a month.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And so--and that just turns into a lot of render time.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Wow.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   You know, and so we need something that we're not tempted or not trying to use in the pipeline.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Just something that sits in a corner and we just send stuff over to it and it comes back done.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Very cool.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You know, that's--
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   It's very exciting.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Well, that's what these are for.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Yep.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Absolutely what these are for.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   All right, so the new X-curves are here.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   The new X-curves are here.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Also a new time capsule up to two terabytes now in the time.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I think that's the only change, right?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I mean, I didn't really pay that much.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   That's nice.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Is it lower price?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I think it's a little-- isn't it just slightly different price?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I don't know if it's a little bit higher or lower, but--
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Slightly different price.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well, it seems to me--
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It seems to me that was a different--I don't know.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   It even printed on my brain, it was a different price before, but I haven't made a way to check.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Automatic wireless backup for your Bach.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Backup a lifetime worth of memories with the all-new time capsule.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Do you think it's a coincidence that all these people released these kinds of things, Drobo
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   and Apple, on the same day?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Yeah, that is weird.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I'm sure Drobo didn't plan this.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Nobody expected this from Apple.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I mean, we knew there'd be a new X-serve, but--so $2.99 for the 500 gigabytes if you want to
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   terabyte $4.99, but you get a router, too, right?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yes.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So you get an 802.11 Wi-Fi base station, dual band support, and then you get the built-in--it's
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   basically an airport extreme with a hard side.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Exactly.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   In fact, it looks the same.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Which is kind of a cool idea for a lot of people.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I mean, if you're doing things like home movie applications and--
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Well, I just, you know, and if I'm going to talk a little bit later about my home--
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   For Mac Mania 9, I'm going to be doing a lecture on using a Mac Mini to make a home theater.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And I bought the Mac Mini, but it only has a 360, 320 gig hard drive, so I bought a terabyte
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   external drive to go on it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   But that just seems like a--I mean, that's a lot--it's like $200 for the terabyte as an
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I6 external quiet terabyte, so I don't know.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I'm not a big time machine fan.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Either of you guys use time machine.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I played with it, but I just thought to myself, it seemed like there's really no need for
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   just any old drive will do.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   So I don't see the two terabyte on here, so maybe I'm misreading the story that I thought
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   I said that they announced a new one.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   I might be wrong about that.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   Wouldn't be the first time.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   Oh, I see.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   It's a Mac rumor.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   This is where I got the idea.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   Mac rumors--
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   Yeah, I read that same thing.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   Club Mac displays the two terabyte time capsule, but they don't sell it.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   It's a trick.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   It's a trick.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   Run for it.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   So I can't imagine why Club Mac would do that by accident.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   If such a thing didn't exist, they must have been sent the image by Apple.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   So maybe Apple announced that later.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   Pardon me.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   I got your hopes up.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   Pardon me.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   I just mostly with the time capsule, I must go, "Okay, pass on."
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   It actually drives me crazy, because it keeps constantly asking me if I get to a new computer
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   and it'll ask me, "Do you want to--"
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   That really bugs me.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   That's kind of--
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Is this hard drive for a time machine?
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   Come on.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   Yeah, I know you do.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   You want to use it?
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   You should be able to turn that off and say, "I will never use time machine.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   I don't want to be bugged about it.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   Please go away."
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   And the other one that I haven't figured out as far as turning things off while we're on
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   that thing, is there a way to turn off the Zoom on Safari?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   Have you run into this on your laptop?
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   The Zoom.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   Yeah, but were you accidentally used whatever gesture it is?
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   I haven't figured it out.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   Something gets really big.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   And my only solution is close the window.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   No, no, no.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   Command zero restores the size.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960]   Just remember that.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   Command zero back to normal.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   Just remember that.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   But yeah, for some reason, it happens to me with a trackpad.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   Isn't that part of the-- in the system preferences?
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   Isn't that part of the--
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   I couldn't find it.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   No, you don't want to turn it off.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.960]   And there doesn't seem to be a way that I can turn it off.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   Exactly.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   There's some gestures for some reason you can't turn off.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Oh.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.800]   You know what freaks me out is that when you open up trackpad in system preferences, there's
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.480]   a movie there with a finger.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   I love that.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   No, I think that's great.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.960]   I know, but it's just weird because it's not what I'm used to.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.760]   That's the best help ever.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   It is.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   It's just--
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.200]   All control panels should have-- I think should have that kind of information on it.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   I love that.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.720]   I just think that's super slick, super neat, super cool.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.120]   But unfortunately, what is not super neat, super slick, it's super cool, is you can't
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.960]   turn the diggity diggity dang thing off.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:18.840]   Ooh, I wonder if all this stuff didn't happen today because of the SNW.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   SSNW.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.680]   The big networking world convention.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   Maybe?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.600]   I mean, because I know Drobo announced there.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   That's probably why Drobo did it.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:37.240]   So Drobo has a new Drobo Pro that is-- they're not replacing the old Drobo, right?
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   The old Drobo is--
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   No.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.600]   So this continued the old USB-only Drobo.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Right.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.200]   But those who just were worried about having a Leo done to them, they just bought a Firewire
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.480]   Drobo and thought, oh no.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.040]   Now, this is a completely different product.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.440]   This is an enterprise level.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.800]   It's a business class.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.160]   It starts at $12.99.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.040]   So if you spent $500 on a Firewire Drobo, it wasn't like, oh, you would have bought the
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.400]   $12.99 one instead.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   However, they do have a $200 upgrade policy.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   They'll knock $200 off if you've previously bought a Drobo.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   You need to get the new one.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.480]   But this has eight drives in it, eight drive bays instead of four.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   It also uses--
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.880]   So it looks like it's roughly the same height, but it's just got wider.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.720]   In fact, if you have two Drobo sitting side by side, that's basically what it is, except
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.600]   for that's one box.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.560]   But the big differences are it has a new faster arm chip.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.200]   The thing is just bloody fast.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.280]   Secondly, it uses this new ISC-SI protocol--
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.680]   I see, yeah.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.160]   --to connect over ethernet.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.800]   No more dinking around with a Firewire cable.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.360]   I talked with two of the beta testers.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.800]   I just got mine, so I haven't had a chance to speed test it.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.760]   But two of the beta testers, one of which I thought Alex would find this interesting,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.960]   a guy shot a movie on the red and they dumped right to the new Drobo.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   Wow.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   So it's that fast.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   It's that fast.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.040]   But it's at least twice as fast.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.280]   It's about twice as fast, I should say, as the Firewire 800 Drobo, for most people.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   And that's the ISC-SI?
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   That's not--
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   I didn't know--
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   Now, an interesting--
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.880]   It's an E-sad, too, doesn't it?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   Or does it not?
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   It does not.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   It does not.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   That's one of the three gigabits.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   And that's what I'd really like to see, of course, no max.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.600]   I think a lot of people are going to complain about that, but I'm sure they're working
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   on it.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   But here's the thing.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:27.040]   The interesting thing is if you run Windows, the drivers for ISC-SI are built in.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.280]   You just turn them on.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   Right.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.400]   But Apple charges 200 bucks for them.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   What?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   So Drobo kind of invented their own.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   And it's all built in.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   Interesting.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   That's awesome.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   Cool.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   Yeah, and it is Rackmountable, too.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   I have a team pack.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   I knew that would attract Alex as well because--
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.080]   I have-- you put E-years on this.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.440]   Rackmounts and compounds go together.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   So why would somebody--
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.400]   It's roughly the same price as a NAS, right?
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.320]   Why would somebody buy this over a NAS?
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   It's simpler.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.160]   There's-- you know, the one thing is-- and I'm not at all a NAS expert, Leo.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   That's what we use here.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.360]   I'm very happy with our NASs.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.280]   But the thing is, is that you can-- this is upgradable in terms of you don't have to
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.720]   pre-- you know, you don't have to say, I know how much storage I'm going to need up front.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.520]   You can mix and match drive sizes and brands.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.560]   You can put them in as needed.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.960]   And it's all done in the background with their thin provisioning client.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.200]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.920]   If you're not, you know, real smart about setting stuff like that up, then, you know--
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   We use it in a--
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   And it's--
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   We use it in a fraught, which has this kind of RAID X.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.840]   I don't know if it's even a standard RAID.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   But it's similar.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.080]   It allows you to-- so we wanted to increase our capacity because we got a terabyte and
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.960]   we wanted to go to four terabytes.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.280]   So one by one, Colleen pulled one drive at a time.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.120]   Just like on the Drobo, put the new drive in, rebuilds-- new drive in, rebuilds.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.720]   So we actually upgraded to four terabytes without losing any data.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.840]   That's about what you do with the Drobo, right?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.960]   And the other thing is that the new Drobo Pro is able to sustain two simultaneous drive
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.560]   failures with no data loss.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.800]   Now that's not-- that's an additional call.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   It looked like that was an additional feature.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   Like you had a buy--
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   No, that's-- if you buy a Drobo Pro--
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   You get that.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   Okay.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   So two--
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   You can turn that--
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.840]   You have to have eight drives in there that make that work probably.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.400]   Yeah, and you can turn that on and off because I think there's some overhead involved, obviously.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   Okay.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   That's what I--
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Okay.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   But it's not something you pay extra for.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   Got it.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.480]   You can also create logical volumes with the new software that you couldn't create before
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.240]   so you can make up to 16 mini Drobo's on one Drobo.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.640]   That's kind of neat, that logical volume thing.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   So--
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.960]   I mean, because one of the things we're trying to do, along with having all these servers
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.200]   that we're looking at getting, we're looking at having some storage that we can just--
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.440]   Everyone just looks at the storage.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.320]   They're not having local assets.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:55.920]   You know, and this is a great way to have a very redundant, fast, you know, set of
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   assets that isn't really complicated to manage.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.400]   You know, it's just-- you just plug them into the switch and put them on the network.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.040]   So what's the minimum number of drives?
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   You have to put at least two drives in, but you go all the way up to eight.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.640]   Do you add two at a time?
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.240]   No, you can add one after that.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   One after the other?
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   And then they're offering $200 off for people who purchase Drobo before, which I think is
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   a very smart thing to do.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.640]   And there's none available right now.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   There are three in the--
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.640]   You have one of them.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.760]   There's three in Florida at the trade show.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.880]   There's the beta units that are in the beta testers' hands, and then there's the one I
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   got.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.200]   But they will be ramping them up pretty soon.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   And they work and everybody's happy with the new software.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.560]   It's a lot of solution.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   Let's face it.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.040]   Most people aren't going to do this.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.640]   Although I could see some high-end users wanting to have the eye scuzzy over the gigabit.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   Because I have a lot of--
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.000]   Well, here's-- you know, I hate screwing around with those Dagum Firewire 800 cables.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   They drive me crazy.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Right.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You know, now I can just plug in--
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So basically, this says Drobo share built in.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.040]   Well, yes and no.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.920]   That's more complicated than I want to get into right now.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.280]   But it doesn't really do a network-type sharing the way I think Drobo share does.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.280]   Oh, it just bounces a drive on that-- on one machine at a time, kind of.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.040]   Using the eye scuzzy connection.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Okay.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.200]   So you're going to get the same effect as if you'd plugged in a Firewire Drobo.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's just going to be faster because it's through the eye scuzzy.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.560]   You're going to free up your Firewire port.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.200]   And in my situation where I'm running off Wi-Fi, I've got the network port open anyway.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   So I can just drop it in.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.760]   But right now, sitting on my desk, or four of the Firewire Drobo's, I can replace that
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.120]   with two of the--
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   It's just insane.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.600]   I can't deal with myself.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.840]   I'm like-- but I'm like a mini version of Alex.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.120]   Alex would have 800 of these if he were here.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   You're just nuts.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.520]   That's so funny.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.240]   I think-- I've been looking at it, and I think that I can fit.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.840]   I think it's like 12 of them, 12 of these new ones in Iraq.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   Oh, please.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.640]   How many gigabytes do you need?
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.360]   So would you buy this instead of the Apple solution?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.840]   What is it? X-rayed or X?
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.360]   Yeah, we're looking at-- well, there are-- those are the promise raids now.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.080]   I guess that's the company that makes the ones that Apple supplies.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.880]   And those are--
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.040]   I've actually heard some bad things about promise, to be honest with you.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.360]   They're pretty pricey.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.920]   You know, so the-- for me, I think that we're really looking at these drobos, or at least
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.080]   we're going to test a couple of them, and then we'll see how well they fit into the system.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.200]   We would like them to be a little bit faster on the transfer given that we've got eight
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   drives there.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.280]   But the reality is, is these aren't-- we're not trying to work off of these drives.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.400]   These are ones for safe storage.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.640]   So you use them back up.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.800]   Well, not back up, or it's not just back up, but we also use them for-- this is where
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.000]   we're going to check the assets out.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Right.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And then put them back.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.400]   But we're not going to-- we're not trying to pull and work off of these drives in real
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   time.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.600]   That's what we use the raids for in the computers that are actually--
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   But you call that scary raid, because it's just for speed, not reliability in any--
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   Exactly.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.800]   But when we want everything to play back in real time, and we're working, we have an
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.160]   entirely HD pipeline.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   So speed is an important thing.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   But we also want to make sure-- right now, we have a lot of redundancy.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.200]   We have a lot of drives floating around.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:36.440]   We have about-- we've calculated that what we really should have is about 60 to 70 terabytes
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.320]   of near line storage.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.680]   And so it would take 10 of these dropos to make that work.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   That's amazing.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.080]   We're still looking at what we're going to do is we're going to get one of these, one
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.400]   of these, and we're going to test them.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.560]   And then we'll probably talk about it more on the show.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   And if they look like they're a good solution for us, then we're going to get more-- or
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.760]   we're going to-- or you might even have a mixed and matched where if the dropos aren't
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.400]   fast enough, then we'll use them as our deep storage and then have something faster for
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.600]   a near line.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.800]   And so those are all the things that we're looking at.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.360]   My dream is to have a big cloud of drives that you're pulling those small drives out
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.400]   and putting the larger drives in, and you're just constantly upgrading individual drives.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.560]   Each week, let's say you pull two or three out and put two or three new ones in that are
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.120]   bigger, and you just go-- you know, just keep on working through because that's how things
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   continually are progressing.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.160]   And this is almost there.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.680]   Like this solution is not quite there, but you could almost do it right now.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.920]   By having these dropos where you could just pull one drive out and put another one in.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.080]   Let's say you had four or five of these.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.920]   Every week, you just pulled the smallest drive out of one and put the largest drive you could
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   buy in it.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.440]   You would slowly upgrade all the stuff, and you wouldn't have to move any files or think
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440]   about it.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.760]   You would just slowly upgrade everything all the time so that you had more and more storage.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   And these devices, eight drives will just become 16 terabytes, then it'll become 32 terabytes,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.880]   then it'll become whatever, and you're just slowly moving with the times.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   Cool.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.760]   9 to 5 Mac says, "Apple should buy Sun."
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.160]   IBM, was it was trying to buy Sun, walked away from the table.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.960]   Actually, I think it was Sun who walked away from the table.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:30.080]   There was a little dissension in the board of directors between the CEO who wanted to
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.200]   sell to Sun and the founder who did not.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   They wouldn't take the $9.40 share and offer, even though Sun is a distressed property at
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.600]   this point.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.800]   So 9 to 5 says, "Hey, here's a thought."
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.120]   What if Apple bought Sun?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.840]   Apple's planning to use ZFS, the Sun file system at some point, which is a good thing,
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.120]   by the way, it's an amazing file system.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.520]   Open office, maybe a full suite that Apple could own.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.600]   Of course, it's already open source, so you can't really take it back out of the open
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.200]   source, I don't think Java.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.560]   Maybe if they bought Sun, they could sell more servers.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.200]   That's really Sun's main business, right?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.400]   What do you think, guys?
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.000]   I don't think Apple needs to buy it.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.120]   I don't think Sun really has a lot that Apple needs.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.280]   I don't think right now with the economy being where it is, Apple needs to be getting into
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.880]   anybody else's problems.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   Keep the cash.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.760]   In other words, keep the cash money.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.120]   When you look at how strong, frankly, both Microsoft and Apple are, cash-wise right now
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.320]   in a down economy, I'd wait till things hit the bottom.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.240]   Then if you're going to buy people, you can take them at a fire sale price.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   See, you're always thinking, "I just got it."
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   I can't help it.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   I'm wired.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   I'm using Predator.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.000]   We ran a couple of days ago.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.320]   We ran a computer chronicles where you were talking about the future of streaming television
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   on computers.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.680]   Do you remember that?
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.480]   I do remember me and stewardship A talking about, "Where did you find that old guy?"
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   It's like YouTube.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Oh my God.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.280]   You know, Link, it was great to see you.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.800]   You were very right on.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.240]   What is happening today is what you were talking about.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.160]   You were just a little ahead of your time.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.400]   Well, what can I say?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.520]   I mean, Alex, we're working on what would have been YouTube for the four times.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.760]   We were just too early, right?
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   It was 2000.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   It was 2000.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.240]   You've got to be kicking yourself on that one.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:28.200]   We were at the DB Garage office there in the muck talking about building YouTube.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.080]   I looked at the 300-bought modem, shook my head, no, and said, "That's the problem."
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   Time wasn't right.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   I can't believe you found that clip.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.160]   You know, that's where I met Paul Shinley who ended up coming to work for me all the time.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.880]   Go go Google yourself, Scott.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.160]   I don't have time to Google myself.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.200]   I'm making new stuff for other people to Google.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   Google yourself.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.640]   So, Steve, just answer me this.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.720]   Did I have hair back then?
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   You did.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   I just wanted to thank you.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   I love that.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   You looked very handsome.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   Good, honey.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   I did.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.800]   I want to revel in the old days for a moment.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.720]   I hate looking at my old TV appearances.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.520]   It's like, "What happened?"
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.440]   I saw, well, I can do you one better.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.760]   I saw one where you were dressed up as some sort of creature on MSNBC.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.280]   Well, at least he was thin.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   Good looking, too.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.560]   But he had purple hair, was kind of a negative.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:24.000]   So all music on iTunes is now officially uncopy protected.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Yeah, 100% iTunes plus.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.040]   And along with that goes what the record companies wanted in return, which is variable
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   pricing.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   Now, depending on how popular the song is, you could pay anywhere from $69 to $99 to $1.29.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   Let me just see.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.520]   Boom, boom, pow, which is number one on the charts from the Black Eyed Peas is $1.29.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.200]   Now, here's what I want to ask, Leo, from the perspective of the mass.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.920]   The mass public using iTunes.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   The people that aren't interested in using all kinds of wild file sharing stuff.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   What this means for them, I think, would be interesting to discuss, because we rarely
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   talk about that.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.760]   It means that you can move your iTunes library from computer to computer without getting
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.280]   all kinds of warning signals.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.600]   Yes, and you can put your music on things other than an iPod for a change.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.160]   Yeah, because everybody's running out to get one of those turkey vomit zooms.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.160]   Well, well, maybe not a zoom.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.840]   But, you know, I mean, there are a lot of people who would like to play it on those
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   places.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.600]   I just move, you can also, the little thing that I ran into, I wanted to make a mix CD
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.560]   for my family, you know, for Christmas, you know, and I've got a big family.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.400]   I've got six brothers or five brothers, sisters, and I'm on my dad.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.720]   So I want to make a mix CD.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.960]   And so I burned a cup.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.800]   And I thought that I had all the stuff that I had already, you know, gotten from CDs.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.440]   And I had a couple of iTunes ones in there.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.120]   And of course, it, it, you know, you can only burn five CDs, you know, with it, you
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.880]   know, with the old DRM.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.960]   And now if you want to do it, I don't know if you wanted to move anything from computer
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.880]   to computer, you don't have to register the computer for the DRM to work.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   You don't have to.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.360]   It's more than just putting on something else.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   It's just move.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   You know, I've got a lot of computers and I just, like, the stuff to be.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   Five, six, five, Max, wasn't it?
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   It wasn't enough.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   So this is a big deal.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.960]   Yeah, I think it's worth it.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.480]   I think that I don't think that it will turn out as well for the record companies as they
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.080]   think it will, because I know for, for me, what I'll do is, you know, I'm not dying to
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.360]   get the newest thing.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.880]   I'll just wait until 69 cents.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.700]   Well, I don't know.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.960]   Regis Philbin is still 99 cents.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:35.280]   So I'm trying to find, I'm trying to find what 69 cents if Regis Philbin is 99 cents.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.520]   I don't know if there are very many.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.360]   What would be what would be the worst crappiest song you could think of?
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Let's see.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.440]   Well, I guess what I would say is that for me, I would mostly, you know, I would mostly
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   just be looking at the 99 cents stuff.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.520]   Jerry, is it all Amos Moses?
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   99 cents.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   What is there?
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   Is there's no, are they all too?
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.520]   Six now?
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   Are they all too?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   They're all they're all 256.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]   They're all unprotected.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.200]   See, I would just be, I think at this rate, I would just wait until something was at least
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   99 cents.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.120]   I wouldn't, you know, I have plenty.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   I have, you know, eight.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   I don't know.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   Wait on anything.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.920]   I just click 30 frickin cents.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   Come on.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   I'm on a cheap skid.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.680]   What do you save it up for a Drobo or something?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.520]   It's like my, my got servers and Drobo's to buy.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.960]   I can't be thrown it around.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.760]   That's a lot of 30 cents.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.400]   I buy a lot of music.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.120]   My dad used to drive Clear Cross town to save two cents on gas.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.360]   You know, come on.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   How many alleys?
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   I really want it.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.960]   Yeah, the reality is if I really want the song, you know, the 129 and 99 is noise.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.760]   You know, I mean, if I'm just.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.400]   You would have to, you would have to not buy 2,333 songs to get one Alex.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.920]   Now that's got, we got to create a denomination for that.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.600]   A mini, a micro Alex, a nano Alex.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.760]   No, no, no, it's got to be like an inverted Alex, the number of songs that you'd have
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.120]   to buy on iTunes at 99 versus one.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:04.240]   It's called an, it's called an, it's called an, it's called an, it's Xela Xela Xela Xela
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.480]   Xela because it's the opposite of Alex.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.960]   It's a bad, it's an, an Alex.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.840]   Yeah, we need somebody in our audience to actually create a lexicon of all the ridiculous
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   things.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.160]   Probably on the wiki, you know, we have a good wiki with a lot of user created stuff like
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   that.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.280]   Hey, I want, in fact, as long as we're asking the audience, find me something on fine is
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.760]   a key breaky heart 69 sets.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.400]   Find me a 69 cent song.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   Macarena.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   How much for them?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   Let me see.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   I can tell you what to look for.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   Okay.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   The worst song in history.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   Shatner.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   Ah, thank you.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   Shatner.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   That's got to be it.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.880]   No, Shatner is probably a buck 29.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:44.400]   No, no, because it's his old, like he's him and Spock, Spock did an album to, you know,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.040]   both of those albums were bad.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.800]   No offense to, to, you know, Mr. Spock, but.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   Letter name.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.160]   I am not Spock.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.320]   I am not Spock by Leonard Nimoy is not his finest hour.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.040]   By the way, Leonard Nimoy is a stupendous still photographer.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.320]   Let me see if I can find this song here.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.320]   Shatner.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   99 cents.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.720]   Oh, no, nothing 69 cents.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.000]   The worst song ever.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   How about this?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   This is even worse.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Leonard Nimoy singing Ruby.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.720]   Don't take your love to town.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.560]   99 cents here.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.080]   A little bit of that just for fun.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.480]   It's got to be one of the worst things.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.320]   You can't sing.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   Oh, don't sing.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Leonard.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Leonard.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:48.200]   Oh, everybody now.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:56.040]   Don't take your best.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   How about this one?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   This is the classic.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:08.680]   You got to figure he was doing that intentionally silly.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   Yeah, but if neither of those are 69 cents, nothing 60.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.920]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   All right, guys, come on.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.920]   Find me.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.120]   Okay, here's a link.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   Somebody prevents songs and they show tell us which song.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   Josh and Nashville.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.080]   He's probably in the music industry.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.400]   He's probably a shill saying, oh, no, we sell songs for 69 cents.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.440]   And here's the list.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.680]   There aren't very many of them.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.320]   We're loading it up right now.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.200]   All the songs on iTunes for 69 cents.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.640]   There's a great songs at a great price thing.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:50.760]   And for $15.87, you get 23 songs, each of them 69 cents, including Motley Crew Home Sweet
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.080]   Home.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.800]   Those are the 23 songs then on iTunes that are 69 cents.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.600]   We found 23 songs.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.080]   No, so these are pretty good.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   This is not bad.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   Blue Easter cult Godzilla.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   Blue Oyster cult.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   Some singing.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.520]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.600]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.840]   How is Blue Oyster cult 69 cents and Leonard Nemo singing Ruby?
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   Good question.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.680]   Loverboy when it's over.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.240]   Wow, this is good.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.760]   These are some good songs on here.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.240]   Nine inch nails.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.720]   I want you.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.640]   So these are these are these, you know, but I think these are what I would call token.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   Token songs.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.400]   They're not really expecting you to up your library with.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   Well, you would.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   You could fill them up.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   You got 23 of them, but I wonder.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   I mean, hmm.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   I don't know.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.640]   Flock of Seacalls ran.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   I ran.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.240]   Thank you, James Britain.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   David Hasselhoff.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   Loverboy.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.240]   Let's see.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   David Hasselhoff.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   That's the point.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.600]   The whole story is variable pricing comes.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.400]   Now I can explain to one of my buddies what a rat hole is.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.480]   That was a rat hole right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.560]   You don't get much rat ear or holier than that rat hole.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   Right?
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.880]   Let's play the rat hole thing.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.960]   We haven't heard from that quite a while.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.840]   Rat hole.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.480]   Thank you.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   I miss Merlin.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.960]   Now I do too.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   Let's call Merlin.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.640]   I miss being ridiculed by Merlin.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.560]   Whatever happened to what was it?
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.280]   The Yachtwax, Monocle Pete's Yachtwax.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.680]   Whatever happened to that.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.960]   I have several people however who have applied to be my squire since Macworld.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.680]   It was squire.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.160]   You know, I know what it is.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.200]   He's jealous because we all have jingles and he doesn't.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   That's it.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.960]   That must be it.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.360]   Speaking of Macworld, I can't go next year.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.680]   Yeah, they moved the day.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.680]   Why can't you go?
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.680]   What are you doing?
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:59.600]   Like millions of others, my calendar had this permanent spot in January to go to Macworld.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.400]   And so you book stuff around it.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.360]   I book stuff around it.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.000]   I took a paying engagement in February at the time which you kind of flicks with Mr.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Kent's decision.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.360]   And it's a, you know, because many people don't realize when we speak at Macworld, we
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.760]   get next to nothing or sometimes nothing for doing so.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.160]   And I have a very, you know, substantial engagement I cannot get out of.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   That's too bad.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.240]   That's the first time in a while, I'm not going to be there.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   And I'm totally sad.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.600]   Oh, that's really too bad.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.680]   So you guys will have to soldier on without me and tell me what I missed.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.160]   Oh, it's not going to be the same without you.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.960]   Well I'm hoping that I can get back.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   I'm going to now.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   I know.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   I know.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.040]   And the truth is you and Steve Jobs are going to go to Hawaii together.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.480]   No, not true.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.080]   However, because there are many of us who have planned on that week and don't have the other
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.040]   week available, I am trying to set up a thing sort of like Aperture World, we're going to
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.680]   call it.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.280]   We're going to do something like Photoshop World for Aperture and we're going to do the same
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.280]   week.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.920]   Good thinking because it's wide open.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.920]   It's wide open.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   Nobody's got anything else to schedule.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.400]   I mean, we're going to compete with CES, but we're going to get the people who would
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.080]   have not gone to CES anyway.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:12.440]   It's going to be sad if Apple ever does do a Beatles iPod, which is just exactly what
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   we were talking about.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:19.600]   By the way, you know, Day 742, the iPod held hostage.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.360]   Steve Merlin had come back for that.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360]   Yes.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.080]   Do not expect another U2 iPod, however.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.120]   U2 is switching to Blackberry and they say it's Apple's fault.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   Uh, Bono.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.480]   Just switching to Blackberry?
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.280]   Well, Bono in an interview with Alan Cross, who was a great guy.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:44.320]   I know, Alan, Toronto DJ, said that he had approached Apple for designing products.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   U2's products.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Remember they did a U2 iPod?
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Apple said no.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   Uh-uh.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   Uh-uh.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.640]   And, uh, and so the band said, well, we're going to go to rim.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.960]   And so we're going to do some Blackberry stuff.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.560]   I don't know if that's quite the right demographic.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   Maybe it is actually.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.320]   Maybe it's exactly the right demographic.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   Uh, I, you know, I, I, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   Come on, Bono.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   Blackberry.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   Blackberry.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   That's not hip.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.920]   It's not with it.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.720]   Well, at least he didn't say it was going to the zoom.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   Yeah, you know, he would have been mocked for that, I think.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.440]   We're mocking him now.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.480]   Apple, uh, has, has been going up.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.960]   I don't know if you noticed on the stock market.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   Uh, Apple.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.360]   I haven't, is that quite a bit?
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:42.120]   And according to a fortune, um, Apple is, uh, let's see, I guess, um, Brini Associates
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:50.520]   Cleve Rookert lists the 40 S&P 500 stocks with the largest increase in market capitalization.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.560]   So far this year.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.640]   And Apple is number one since December 31st, 2008, which remember the stock market has
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.360]   been crashing since then.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:09.840]   It shares have grown 35.9% adding more than 27 billion to its market cap.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   That's amazing.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   Yep.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.960]   That's really amazing.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.040]   It was 85 bucks at the end of the last year.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.840]   It is now a well, well, as of April 3rd was 115, but I think it's over 119 now.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.480]   You know, it's, I just find it interesting.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.840]   Everyone is, is constantly waiting for Apple to fail here.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.800]   You know, you, you, you, you constantly are hearing the, oh, the economy is going to catch
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.600]   up with, with companies that are charging money.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.880]   Uh, it, it appears that, um, most of the money, except, I mean, most of the companies that,
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.960]   that charge a lot on for things except for Apple.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.720]   Listen though to who else is on this list is kind of interesting.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:55.780]   IBM increase, uh, in price 21% adding 24 billion in market cap, Google 20% adding 19
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.360]   billion Amazon.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   Its price went up 52%.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.120]   Uh, Cisco 11%.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.880]   These are, this is all during the worst stock market since the Great Depression.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.960]   Well, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that people are, I mean, these are,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.840]   these are companies that, that in their niche, they are excelling.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.120]   I mean, they've been, they've been cutting new ground.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.320]   Uh, and so, uh, those are the ones that they've, they've focused on a market.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.000]   They're, they're owning that market.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.840]   And, um, and I think that that's made it made a huge difference for them.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.080]   And by the way, Apple also tops the list of the lowest paid CEOs because Steve Jobs only
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.880]   gets a buck still.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.680]   Uh, motor, compare this to the guy at the top of the list.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:46.880]   Motorola's Sanjay, uh, J, Jha took a $104 million last year in salary bonuses, perks,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.920]   stocks and options, even though his company was down 71%.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:56.360]   It doesn't sound like he's a very good investment.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:01.600]   Larry Allison on the list, Walt Disney's Robert Eiger and, uh, kind of Chanel of American
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   Express.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.480]   But Steve, you know, I think that's not fair to say Steve gets a buck because it doesn't
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.640]   he get option grants?
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.800]   And I know he got, has a jet.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   You got a jet.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   And he's got shares.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.400]   He's just, he's, he's working to improve the value of his shares.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.240]   And I'm sure he's got some compensation agreement involves things like, um, and we can find
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.800]   out what his compensation agreement is.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   It's a company.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   It's a company.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.200]   I'm sure it involves a lot of perks, but it's not like Steve sitting there counting his
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.240]   hundred dollar bills are really worried about it.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.580]   Well, and I think that, I think this is what a lot of people got really upset about
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.080]   with the banking scandal and everything else is you have people who are getting paid huge
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.120]   amounts of, of, of options, but also huge amounts of real money from companies that
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.160]   are losing huge amount, you know, huge, you know, losing a lot of money.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.080]   And I think that drives people crazy.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.900]   You know, and, and I think that, uh, and I, and I, I do think that it, it makes a huge
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:57.780]   difference to get shares, especially long, you know, long term shares that you could,
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.700]   um, I think that that ties you to making sure that the company's doing well.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   No, I like that.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.000]   I'd much prefer to see that.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.600]   So, um, have you seen the new Microsoft, uh, ad there?
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.000]   There's a new in Newsweek, Daniel Lyons, fake Steve Jobs, formerly fake Steve Jobs, uh,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.960]   writes about the new Microsoft ads, the ad campaign where, you know, I'm not cool enough
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   to buy a Mac.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.200]   He says it brilliant because what they're doing is saying it's not cool that that in
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.980]   fact, cool is being smart enough to save money and get a good computer and that all these
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.160]   doofuses who are buying Macs, uh, are the opposite of cool.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.680]   They're, they're, they're hipsters posing hipsters.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.320]   You think that's a good campaign?
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   Here's my thought.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.880]   If you're going to spend $200 million to make fun of people that buy your competitor,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.680]   why not take half that and just try to make sure that your operating system doesn't crash
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   every 15.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.920]   You're just an idea with the switch.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   The switch.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   See, but wait a minute.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   Apple has done the same thing though.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.960]   Apple spent a lot of money on the, on these switch ads.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:05.780]   In fact, Apple's entire campaign for the, the computers anyway was anti Vista, anti windows.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.540]   I think it's fine to do it.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.540]   It's worked.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.940]   I think it's fine to do it, but the reality is that windows really isn't cool.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.860]   It's pretty hard to make it cool, isn't it?
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.100]   Yeah, you're, you know, that's really, you know, complicated.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.580]   I mean, you know, and, and you're not going to, I mean, and they're getting, they're getting
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.860]   squeezed from both ends.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.700]   I mean, I, I saw someone talking today and they were saying, you know, it's a, this is
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700]   a big company.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:36.300]   And they were saying in the next 12 months, we don't plan to have very many seats of, of,
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   of windows office.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.060]   I mean, they're not even talking about the operating system.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.920]   They're just talking about, you know, we're, we're now using, you know, they were using
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.420]   Google for a lot of the stuff that they're doing.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.940]   And you know, that is a, you know, they're getting pushed from Apple and Google really
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:55.060]   have Microsoft between, you know, rock and hard place.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.420]   They're taking both businesses.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:08.020]   Lions interviews, a guy from Microsoft about this.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.940]   And he says that actually this is our plan.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:17.060]   He quotes Microsoft general manager for brand marketing, David Webster saying the ugly attacks
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:24.500]   from Mac fanboys, you guys are exactly what the company was hoping to provoke.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.100]   Okay, well, let's see how it works for them.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:34.020]   We'll see how they're still working for you now.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.260]   If I was concerned, yeah, they're buying Microsoft stock.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.180]   Yeah, I don't see.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   I don't see.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   I don't see.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.180]   I don't see.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:49.820]   I don't even get enough of a rise anymore to, to worry about.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.940]   I mean, we can say this stuff on the show, but it's, I don't really think about their
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.580]   ad campaigns anymore.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.460]   You know, I don't really, I'm not really worried about it.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:00.420]   I mean, I think there's a lot of people that have them based on the hit.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.740]   So you don't, but let's just, this is the strategy.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:10.940]   He says we, this is a direct quote from, from the long, I'm not the long, David Webster,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:15.260]   quote, we associate real people with being PCs.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.260]   So that's step one.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.420]   That's that whole, I'm a PC thing.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.700]   And then Apple ends up looking pretty mean spirited because they're going after PCs,
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.700]   i.e. real people.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.740]   He says, it's clear who they're insulting.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.140]   He also says, he also tries to fan the flames a little bit.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:37.820]   Not everyone wants a machine that's been washed with unicorn tears.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.740]   I didn't know we got that.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.580]   That's even, that's an added bonus.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:43.580]   You know, one ever told me.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.580]   Wow.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   That's cool.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.300]   Now I'm glad I paid five grand for that Mac Pro.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.820]   That's some sort of shot at environmentalists or what?
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:57.700]   No, no, it's like, it's, it's, you know, Microsoft has traditionally been really lead
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   footed in all this.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.260]   And I think they're just, this is just them.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:07.260]   They just don't, they're kind of tin-eared, tin-eared, lead footed and, and, and,
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.260]   right.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.260]   Listen, here's the thing.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.340]   I, I, I mean, living in the Seattle area, I know some people that work at Microsoft and
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.540]   they're stunningly smart, which when you look at the end result of what they create makes
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.660]   you wonder how that happened.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:24.340]   And I, I mean, some of the people there are trying to come up with cool things, but it
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.820]   seems like, you know, they're spending money on crap like this when they should be giving
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.140]   those people sort of a skunk works to go in there and say, okay, we're going to actually
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.020]   do something and we're going to leave the committees out of it.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:39.420]   I don't, I, you know, I think part of the problem, I think part of the problem is because
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:44.020]   they have incredible, um, if you look at the Sea Dragon project and the photoscent and
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   the stuff that they're doing.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.820]   That's specifically, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.900]   And, and so the thing is, is that if you look at that stuff, it is, um, stellar work.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.420]   I mean, top of the top, you know, but the thing is, is that most of Microsoft's money
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:01.460]   is coming from, um, something that is bloated and, you know, it has a lot to do with the
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.940]   past and not much to do with the future.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.140]   And that's both office and the operating system.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:11.380]   And I think that's the, that's the issue is that everything there is tied to what people
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.380]   want.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.380]   No one wants it to change very much.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.100]   They, but you have to add features to get them to buy it.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.780]   Um, you know, no one really cares.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:22.140]   I think, you know, 80, you know, I get that they have a huge market share, but most of
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.580]   that market share are companies who buy it in bulk.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:29.340]   The individuals, if you just looked at home users, I'm not saying that there be more Mac
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.940]   users, but it would, the, the percentage would be much closer.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.540]   You know, and I think that's the, um, you know, I think that's a big distinction.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.540]   All right.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:43.340]   Let's get to our picks of the week in the, oh, I, I forgot about commercial.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.340]   Commercials.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.540]   Are we supposed to do those?
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.180]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.420]   So let this be a good time to mention our friends at Audible and then we'll get to our
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.780]   picks of the week.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.020]   We don't have any, you know why I forgot?
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:00.700]   I don't have Mr. Ennaco with me to, uh, to do a pick.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.060]   I am on my own.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.820]   My gosh knows there's plenty of books I can choose from Audible.com.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.060]   They're our great sponsor here and you can try them right now by going for free, going
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.700]   to Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.340]   Sign up for one of those, one of them, Thar Goldic.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.260]   I have a platinum account.
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.860]   That's two books a month.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.420]   But so you could do a platinum account, but the gold account gives you one book a month
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.700]   and that's a good way to try it.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.660]   You know, and when you do this, that first book is free.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.140]   They're credit toward the first book is free.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.420]   It's kind of hard to choose though.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.020]   That's, you know, you, you get, I get one book.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.020]   Oh, let me see.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.020]   What should I?
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Oh man.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.020]   There's so many.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.020]   Oh boy.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.860]   There are so many great choices.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:45.540]   That's one of the reasons we, we always have our recommendations from Audible.com.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.660]   And I've been, I have been listening some really great books.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:53.460]   Right now I'm listening to a book that I think, I want to say Megan Moroni recommended
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:58.980]   to me about the last Empress of China, Empress Orchid.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.260]   It's an on-chee-min book and I'm reading that because I'm getting ready for my trip to China.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:06.100]   So I'm going to be reading a lot of China books in the next few months.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.060]   Are you going to learn Chinese?
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.940]   I study it in college, but you know, I don't think I have time to learn Chinese.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.420]   I'm afraid.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.580]   I wish I did.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.860]   You know, I am so excited about going.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.980]   So I have been, I have been, say again?
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.620]   I thought you already knew Chinese.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   Well, that's what I said.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.420]   I learned it 30 years ago.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:30.700]   Oh, I don't think I remember much of it.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.180]   I might get this book.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.620]   Simon Winchester writes great books.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.020]   He wrote the one, the crack on the edge of the world, which is the 1906 earthquake.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.700]   He wrote The Mad Men and the Professor, the story of the Oxford English Dictionary, the
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.980]   map that changed the world.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.900]   Some really wonderful books.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.060]   One of his newest books is The Man Who Loved China.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:53.140]   Simon Winchester wrote and reads it and he's one of those rare authors who reads incredibly
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.140]   well.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:54:00.660]   It's a story of the eccentric scientist, Joseph Needham, who turned his genius to the study
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   of China.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:07.740]   He fell in love with a visiting Chinese student, became fascinated, went to China and he tackled
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.980]   one of the great unanswered historical questions.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:16.140]   Why did a nation that invented so much gunpowder writing?
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.540]   I mean, just on and on and on.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:24.140]   They did the first printing presses, noodles, and enjoyed 5,000 years of flourishing civilization
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.580]   failed to undergo the Industrial Revolution.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.740]   What happened?
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.460]   He wrote 17 volumes of China.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.060]   It sounds like a fast, I can't wait to read this.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.860]   This is on my next listen list.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.580]   It might be something you'd want to take a look at.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.580]   That sounds fascinating.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.580]   Isn't that sound interesting?
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   Absolutely.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.060]   That might take more time than this Spartans.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.020]   No, it's not long, 9 hours and 11 minutes.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.820]   You'd think it's not all 17 volumes.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:46.820]   Nothing.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.220]   It's a short book.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220]   But see, this is what I do.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:56.740]   I load up, before I travel, I load up with books about that country.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.820]   Some fiction, some nonfiction.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.740]   I just love when you're walking the Great Round Wall of China to be listening about
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   the history of it.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.900]   It's so much fun.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.100]   So I'm going to put this one on my list.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.140]   There's some other ones too I'll recommend over time.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.500]   But this will be the first.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:16.340]   It is Simon Winchester, the man who loved China.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   And it could be yours free.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.260]   But don't, you know, you don't have to be limited by our picks.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.140]   There are 50,000 plus volumes.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.140]   All sorts of great stuff.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.940]   Just go to audible right now and try it out.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.940]   People.com/macbreak.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.380]   Thank you so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.380]   Give it a try.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   We know you're going to love it.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.100]   I get email all the time for people who said, "I have to read this."
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.620]   I won't read it now, but next show I'll read this.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.260]   The great email from a guy who's just cursing me out because he says, "Well, at first I
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.260]   listened to Fallen Dragon.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   Then I listened to this.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.580]   And now I'm stuck in the," and he says, "I can't get out of my car.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.580]   I love these books so much."
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.420]   All right, let's get to our picks of the week.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.900]   And I'm flipping the gold coin, the traditional ceremonial gold coin we use for this purpose.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.020]   And I have come up with Alex Lindsey as our first pick of the week.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.340]   Mr. Lindsey, go right ahead.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.580]   So I'm going to have to apologize for this pick.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.700]   How many Alexes are we talking?
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.900]   Oh, no, no, it's not very expensive.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   It's an iPhone app and it's only a dollar.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.620]   But it's not the price that I'm apologizing for.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:28.100]   It's the sheer level of addiction.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:32.660]   So here's the thing, I don't play very many games because things like what's happened
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.660]   to me over the last week.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:36.260]   It's hard to convince physics.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:42.180]   It is related to the tower defense.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:47.820]   So I downloaded probably three months ago, three or four months ago this little thing
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:48.820]   called Field Runners.
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.820]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.180]   And I did not start playing it.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.340]   It just sat on my iPhone.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.300]   I have like seven pages of iPhone apps.
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.300]   Yeah, a lot of apps.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.340]   It just floated around there and floated around.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.900]   And I was waiting for, I think I opened it once, I didn't really rock it.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:09.940]   And then I was waiting for the plane when we were, you know, for this trip.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.380]   And I was on the plane and I just didn't want to take my computer out.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.900]   And so I'll just play this little game.
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.900]   Oh, oh, dear.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.900]   Oh, oh, dear.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.900]   Oh, oh, dear.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.940]   You played it the whole way across the Atlantic.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.700]   I played it a lot and I keep on playing it.
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.700]   And I keep on it.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.860]   Like every time, and I feel like, did you ever see the gods must be crazy?
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:29.860]   Yes.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:35.940]   And there's those guys that are some of the henchmen and they're always hiding somewhere
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:36.940]   and playing cards.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.460]   You know, they're always like, they're always constantly playing poker with each other or
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:41.460]   whatever they're playing.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.620]   You're sneaking off to play this game?
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.180]   No, I'm not sneaking off to play the game.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.020]   But every time things slow down, I find myself like opening my iPhone and like, oh, I'll finish
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.340]   this game because you can pause it.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   So you can sit there and play.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:54.580]   And then you get, so I just fill up all these little gaps of waiting in the line for coffee
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.900]   or waiting in the line for somewhere else or waiting for someone to do something.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.980]   You know, you just open up the iPhone and play another couple levels and then you put
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.140]   it away again.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:07.020]   And it is, it's just really, in fact, I have to say that in some ways I enjoy it more than
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.820]   desktop tower defense.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.620]   And so, you know, number one is that desktop tower defense, I always have to be connected
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.820]   to the computer, to the internet.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:14.820]   Right.
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.020]   And this is just in my pocket.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.780]   It fills the time of where.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.500]   And for 99 cents, it is a, it's pretty much a must have.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.660]   I mean, well, except for the fact that you, there's a productivity cost.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.020]   So that might be still an Alex.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.220]   You might be losing some of your dollars.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.420]   I think they raise the price.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.420]   I'm looking.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.420]   It looks like it's two 99 now.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.020]   Well, see, that's it's going up to four 99 soon.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.660]   So it's absolutely worth it.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:42.020]   It's, it's, it's, it really will buy it while it's two 99.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:47.980]   It is painfully addicting, but just it really shows you what you can.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.180]   It's just, it's a well designed app.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:53.460]   And it's just really exciting to see those kind of things working on the, on the iPhone.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.380]   You know, it's just, it's really fun.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.820]   Have you beat it though on the half?
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.180]   On all the way, all the way up.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.780]   I did a hundred levels.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.780]   It's a hundred levels.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   If you're.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:04.780]   But on the higher, I'm the.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:05.780]   Oh, I have no, no, no, no.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   Hi.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.780]   I've only, I've only beat it on medium.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.020]   So I, I, I can't beat it on medium.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.820]   I, I can beat it on easy, but I haven't been able to beat it on medium.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:20.020]   I've been, I, I defeated in fact right before the show started, I, I lost at, at level 99.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.020]   Oh, on the hard level?
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.020]   No, on the medium.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.020]   On the medium.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.020]   On the hard level.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.180]   I haven't had the guts to go to heart until I can consistently beat it at medium.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.180]   Stay in there.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.180]   It's really a fun game.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:36.020]   And then it moved to hard and, now let me ask you about your strategy.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:40.340]   Strategy is all about it's all about the length of the, you know, it's, it's size.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.340]   The length does matter.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:48.700]   So, so the, the key is, is, is that I, is I focus heavily on missile launchers and, and
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:52.380]   then the little goo things to slow things down because you want to expose them to as
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.660]   many missiles as possible.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.820]   And then, then along each row, so I use, I make little diagonal rows.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.580]   So it comes out and I just do these diagonal rows back and forth and on those diagonal
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:07.100]   rows, rows on each row after the first one, I put the little high voltage things, you
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.780]   know, so I put one on each row going down.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:15.380]   And then I put lots of missile launchers that are intermingled with the little goo things
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.540]   to slow them down so that they have to move slowly while they're just getting the jeavers
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.500]   pounded out of them from the, from the missiles.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   But the thing that really makes the difference.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   I like the electricity.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.220]   If you can afford the electricity, it's a really effective tool.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.540]   And when you get, and you, and you just stack them all the way up to the third level of,
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.540]   of the electricity.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   You got to make them.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.780]   Yeah, you got to make them though.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.540]   So, so you make them go up and down and up and down because you make, you got to make
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.020]   them go as long, as far as possible.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020]   Right.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.380]   But you don't want to, is you don't want anything that lets them just run free.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.900]   You know, you want to keep on making them zigzag.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.500]   And it's really important is if you spend a lot of money on a, on a high voltage tower,
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.340]   you want to surround it with those little goo things to make sure that they spend as much
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.020]   time next to the tower as possible.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:59.380]   And I have, I have, I have this like, kill zone where I have like four towers on two,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.980]   on either side of the row.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.740]   And then it's all surrounded by these, the goo towers.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   And they get in there.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   We're talking about Twitter.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:13.220]   Anyway, so it's, it's, it's fun.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.220]   Strategy.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.620]   So you get people to stop complaining about the Twitter talk because of our discussion
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.620]   of life.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.380]   They'll say, would you please stop talking about field runners?
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.420]   You've been talking about it for six episodes now.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.260]   I don't need any more strategy tips.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:29.580]   No, I needed those strategy tips because I am, I can't get past like 96 or 97 on, on
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.580]   medium and you're right.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.740]   I haven't even gone to hard.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.740]   It's tough.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.740]   It's tough.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.060]   It's, it's, I've got some growth to do.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.060]   All right.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.580]   I'm going to do it as long as we're going to do iPhone apps, I'm going to do one myself.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.380]   So I'm building a a home and then we'll get to you Scott.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.380]   Okay.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   I haven't forgotten.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   I'm right here.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380]   Happy.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.380]   You're going to, you're going to be the closer.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   Okay.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.380]   I can handle it.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   You're going to take us home.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.580]   So I am, I'm, I'm happily ensconced.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:02.300]   It's actually been quite a fun project in building a home theater system with a Mac mini
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.140]   because I just, you know, maybe it's because I hacked the Apple TV or something, but it
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.140]   just, it seems like it's, it's, I have to reboot it a lot and it doesn't play back
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.420]   a lot of the stuff I download.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.900]   So it's been a lot of time converting stuff and it's just been a pain and I'm thinking,
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:20.020]   you know, I could probably automate this all if I had an actual computer.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:24.540]   So I got a Mac mini, but now it's getting out of control.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.900]   It really is because then, okay, now I'm thinking, and then I got the terabyte drive,
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.900]   right?
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.700]   And then I'm thinking, oh, I really don't want all this in the, in the, our big TVs in
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.700]   the bedroom.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   I don't want it next to the TV in the bedroom.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.140]   Jennifer already complains about all the lights and worrying sounds.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.300]   So I'm going to have to put it in another room and I have to figure out a way to control
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.340]   it in the other room.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.780]   And then I have to figure out a way to control the cable box.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.260]   I'm using ITV, which is amazing.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.940]   In fact, there is a way to do all of this.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.700]   I'll probably over time, I'll talk about all this.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.140]   I have to write a blog post or something, but I am going to give the lecture on it on
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.980]   Mac mini and nine.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.460]   But one of the coolest things I found that, that you can actually use in a variety of
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.940]   situations, but it's really good for a home theater PC is called air mouse.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.700]   Have you guys played with that at all?
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.060]   I haven't.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.980]   So air mouse is an iPhone app and a desktop app that you have to have the desktop app
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.700]   running on the computer you want to control.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.460]   You can control multiple computers.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:28.300]   If you know, you could, so for 599 you buy air mouse and put it on your iPhone.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:32.100]   And now you put the air mouse stub, by the way, it works on Windows computers as well
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.100]   as Macs.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.180]   Air mouse stub on the other computer.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.660]   And now you can do two things.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.500]   One, you can use your iPhone's accelerometer to wave the mouse around and move the mouse
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.260]   on the remote computer.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.820]   Does this, by the way, not by infrared or RF.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.980]   It uses Wi-Fi.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.300]   So I don't, the computer doesn't have to be in the same room.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.380]   It does not, as long as it's on the network, it doesn't matter where it is.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.980]   So I have the computer in the other room.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980]   I use the air mouse.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.820]   It also, I tried the air mouse when it first came out and I didn't, I had a hard time getting
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.140]   used to the accelerometer way of waving the mouse.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:09.060]   You know, you tilt the mouse left, right, tilt it forward back.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.580]   But they now have a trackpad version.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:15.300]   It turns the iPhone's surface into a trackpad.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:20.060]   There's a keyboard so you can type, there are function keys.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.060]   It is amazing.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.620]   Special media keys so you can launch front row or you can launch ITV.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:30.060]   Actually use front row as my main controller than ITV is a, there's a plugin for that,
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   the called Pi TV that allows you to use ITV in front row.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.900]   I mean, it's just very, very slick.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:42.780]   The desktop application is free, 599 for the iPhone application.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.940]   I'm just going to put this on all my computers.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.220]   It'd be great for presentations.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.060]   It has a mode where it doesn't go to sleep.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.980]   You could absolutely use this in lieu of the key note presenter application that comes
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.340]   from Apple.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.340]   It would do more.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.940]   It gives you full control.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.380]   And because it uses Wi-Fi, it really is fantastic.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:10.140]   So AirMouse Pro, it's called the newest version, the newest update came out in March, $5.99.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:16.540]   If you need to control a Mac over the network, this is a great application to do it.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:21.380]   And kind of a must have for if you're going to do this home theater thing with an iMac.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.220]   Okay, I'm done.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.220]   That sounds fantastic.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   It's really cool.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.220]   I'll show you when you come in here.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.900]   You know, when you're in the studio, there's a TV across the room from me.
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.820]   That's actually running an iMac.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.220]   And now I can control it with my iPhone.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.420]   You know, I use the Apple remote for the Apple TV is great.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.780]   This is like the next level better.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.300]   It's really, really great.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   Mr. Scott.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   Yes, I will show you.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.260]   Next time you're here, I will give you a demo.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.460]   Yes, that'll be hidden.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   That'll be the next week.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460]   You're going to come back.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460]   You'll be back next week.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.460]   Well, you two.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.460]   We're going to wear.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.860]   I'm going to go to Vegas for NAB.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.860]   Oh, NAB.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.780]   I have some things I want you to look at when you're at it.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.780]   I'm ready.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.260]   I'm going to be looking at lots of things in NAB.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.580]   I want to look at hardware switchers.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.580]   Yes.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:10.420]   Well, I'm there as a rumor that there'll be a new one available that has lots of inputs.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   That's what I need.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   I need tons of inputs.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:16.620]   So I can't say who, but I have heard that there might be one with 16.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.740]   That would be really nice.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.660]   So we will see if that actually occurs.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:26.700]   I just want to point out that if you've ever seen Alex at NAB, he has a look on his face
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:38.460]   that sort of mimics what Larry Flint looks like at a porn convention.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.980]   Scott Bourne, what is your pick, my friend?
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:45.020]   Well, I think we've talked about this before, but I don't think we've talked about the particular
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.700]   iteration, which I came by it.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.540]   My pick is delicious library.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:55.900]   Real pick is the little USB one that you can buy extra that nobody buys, but I bought.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.060]   I never even heard of it.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.060]   What does it do?
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060]   What do it do?
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.540]   Basically, it's not USB.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.500]   I'm sorry, Bluetooth.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.620]   It's a little wand that instead of walking around with your laptop and pointing your laptop
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:11.420]   at things to put in your library, you just carry this little Bluetooth device and you
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.020]   scan it and it puts it into your delicious library.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.020]   And it's right.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.020]   It's the same people that sell delicious library.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.180]   It's a couple hundred bucks or something like that.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.500]   But I got delicious library on one of my computers and I'm the kind of guy that actually buys
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.020]   licensed software.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.900]   So I got another copy as part of the Mac Heist bundle, which I needed from my laptop.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.780]   And then I went ahead and bought from the delicious library people, the little Bluetooth
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.780]   thing.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.620]   And oh my gosh, you can just go along and scan all your stuff in a minute, just seconds.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.620]   It's really cool.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.500]   Does it mean the whole thing is...
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.060]   Does the device hold the stuff in memory until you hook it?
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.380]   Oh no, it's doing it over Bluetooth.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   So you just...
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.380]   Yeah, it just goes right to the thing.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.100]   It's the same as if you...
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.540]   At first I was doing the thing where you hold a book up in front of your laptop and it shows
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.420]   you the place to put it and it goes, "Oh, that's such and such a book."
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.100]   And I'm like, "Okay, that's cool, but this is going to take forever."
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.260]   So I got that thing and then I just walk along and...
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.660]   This is the ROV, they call it, a room.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.660]   So that's my pick.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:14.900]   My pick is to get that thing if you got a lot of books and CDs and video games and the
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.820]   whole concept is just brilliant.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:23.060]   I mean, it seems to me, a guy my age, something right out of a Dick Tracy watch kind of thing
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:27.380]   in a comic book, but to be able to catalog all your stuff like that.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:33.100]   And my big problem is as I own four and five copies of some albums because I forgot how
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.100]   I am.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.100]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.100]   You know, it's really sad.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.220]   It is really elegant software.
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.700]   And of course we had the creator on the show.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.700]   I know.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.700]   But I don't think we've talked about that.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.260]   He didn't mention the ROV though.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.820]   I don't think we've talked about that before.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.140]   So that's how I snuck it in as an official pick of the week.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.140]   Now it's a little weird because if you go to the website to buy it, you're going to
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.060]   go, how do I get it?
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.780]   You have to buy the software first, right?
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.780]   And then it's in.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.740]   Yeah, it comes up as an option.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.380]   It's the store is in the software.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.980]   So just download the software and then you can see the store and you can buy it.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.980]   Yep.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:06.980]   It's kind of weird.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.980]   It is.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.980]   They could do a better job of that.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   But...
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980]   Well, maybe it's sensible.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.980]   I mean...
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.420]   Once you've got the thing, you'll be happy you had it.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.620]   You may not be happy at what you paid for it, but you'll be happy you had it.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.820]   Well, I wish Will Shipley when he was on the show had mentioned that.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   Yes, Will.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.820]   What's your problem?
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.820]   What's your problem?
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:24.820]   Will isn't...
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   Is hiding his light under a bushel.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.220]   I never understood what that meant.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.420]   Well, I think you just illustrated quite well what it meant.
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.700]   Yeah, but bushel of what?
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.940]   A bushel of grain or corn?
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.540]   Why would you hide your light under a bushel after all?
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.220]   You wouldn't if you were Scott Borne.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.220]   There we go.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.420]   This is something Scott and I.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.620]   And Alex, frankly, know nothing about.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.700]   I'm not much into light hiding.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:56.860]   Gentlemen, it has been a blast.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:01.620]   If you ever wish to come to our studios, we now have wine that we serve.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.620]   Excellent.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.300]   At 11 o'clock in the morning.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.540]   I don't care when.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.780]   If you're here, I'm pouring.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.460]   Excellent.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.300]   Would there be a nice vintage of Diet Coke available for me?
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.660]   Oh, we'll get you something.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.900]   Maybe a little brain tonic to ease your pain.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900]   Okay.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   I can use that.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   Yes.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.540]   Don't forget Scott Borne has now got one site to rule them all.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:28.900]   Whether it be cranes in the fire mist or fire cranes in the mist or just building cranes
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900]   in the mist.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.820]   It's scottborne.com.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.260]   New critiques I saw went up on the critique site.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.020]   Actually, we'd start to do a new thing where I let the audience go first.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.020]   They do the critique.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.020]   That's smart.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.020]   That's cool.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.620]   And then I jump in and get to look like I'm really smart.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.820]   Very cool.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:49.980]   scottborne.com.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:54.260]   Alex Lindsay's a head and head and bottle washer and chief cook and everything but the
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:01.500]   CFO apparently at the pixel core pixel core.com for that great guild of multimedia artists
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.700]   and pixel core TV for their broad variety of podcasts.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.740]   Now with 89 different Mac break flavors, they got more Mac break flavors and basket and
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.740]   robins.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:13.980]   I don't know how Alex does it.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.420]   Pixel core.tv.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.420]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:23.420]   Don't forget our twit pics are at twit.tv/pics often with some fine Macintosh pics.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.020]   And you can subscribe to this on iTunes.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:30.460]   If you just search for twit in the iTunes store TWIT, you'll find a whole bunch of shows
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.460]   there.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.740]   Some new shows launching in the next few days too.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.460]   Sarah and Martin's new show this week in fun will be coming out there.
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.460]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.100]   We'll see you next Tuesday.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.100]   Another Mac break.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:42.820]   Peace, bro.
