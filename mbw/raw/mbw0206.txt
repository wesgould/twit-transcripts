[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   everything, everything important that happens in the little town
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   of Cupertino, California.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsay of the PixelPore.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes, here in Cupertino.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Wait, this doesn't look like Cupertino at all.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I cut my teeth in San Jose and I love Cupertino.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's a very nice place.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It used to be prune orchards.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yes.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And also with us, Mr. Andy, I'm not coming from back east
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   somewhere.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Life is simple here in Grover's corners.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Sounds like you did.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I like to.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I actually own my own step ladder if that helps.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   People are casting.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So have step ladder.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But stay up to stage.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Great to see you.

[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and suspenders.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Don's son had elective surgery, routine surgery and is in the hospital.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But Don decided it would be better to be with his son than with us.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And I don't blame him.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But I will mention his screencast online one more time before this show is over
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   because it has to do with my pick of the week this week.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So welcome everyone.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Let's talk about the news.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   First of all, I guess jailbreak for iPhone 4 and iPad.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And a very easy jailbreak it is.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Have you jailbroken anyone?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I just can't deal with the instability.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's too much part of my daily routine that I'm afraid.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I feel like I forget another iPhone or another iPad that I'm just going to break.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And then just in case it actually breaks.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's so easy now.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You just go there and safari and boom.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's exactly it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I've always had a jailbroken iPhone as long as there's been jailbreaks for iPhones.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And when I first got access to this like totally web app, I mean, Steve, Steve
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Jobs should be happy because he is promoting web apps as an alternative to like the
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   uncurrated app store.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So this is just following Steve Jobs orders because you just hit a website, click
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   a button and your phone is jailbroken.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   But I really, I mean, I really do stop.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Again, I have the sacrificial lamb iPhone, not even my special jailbroken phone, but a
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   third phone that I haven't used in two years.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   None of my personal information is on it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And yet I still think, okay, Andy, how well it's like a Nigerian prince is giving you
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   the opportunity to jailbreak your iPhone via a website.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Why would you trust this to only do this wonderful positive thing to your phone?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You're actually quite smart.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I did not think of that, Andy, but you're absolutely right.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   In fact, that's the larger security issue that this if you go, if you want, if you
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   want the Nigerian prince to crack your phone, just go to jailbreakme.com.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We did it on Twitter.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Brian Brushwood was brave enough to try it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I tried it on my iPad and at the time it crashed the iPad.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It is not that has apparently been fixed.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Tom Merritt did it to his iPhone on the tech news today yesterday.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I was thinking of doing it to my iPad until I read how this works.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It uses a previous unknown, but unpached hole in Safari that allows you to, as a
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   website, present a PDF link that when clicked upon, launches an exploit, it has to do with
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   the way the PDF viewer loads Fons Aquana to Erica Og and on CNET Circuit Breaker column.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And by doing so can run arbitrary software.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So I wasn't even thinking, but you're absolutely right, Andy.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The fact that you can go to a website and then download and install software automatically
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   means that, well, you're pretty open to exploits.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah, and given all the HUHA that got the people were going through last week when that
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   mean-spirited Android app that gives you a wallpaper, but also transmits all of your personal
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   information to a site in China, the iPhone also has a lot of those same problems too.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's not as though a properly written exploit like that can't get access to your entire
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   address book and send it to another app, another source.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So you see, I just swiped and now it's already doing the jailbreak.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And I'm not saying that this is a bad thing.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm just saying that there's such a thing as a mourned fear and certainty and doubt, and
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   then there's such a thing as, you know what, I think I'm going to look left and right
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   before I cross the street.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I think this is one of those cases.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And a real big irony in this is that once you jailbreak, all you really do, this is not
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   an unlock.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Right.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   All you're really doing is allowing yourself to put third party app stores and third party
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   apps unapproved by Apple on here, including Sedia.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And there is an irony in here.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The chat room is telling me that Sedia has a fix for the Safari flaw.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So you can open it and then close it.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But the problem is when you open it, you don't know what got in there.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You don't know what's there, what was added.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Right.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You know, that's the concern.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   So truthfully, as I do this, I have no idea what I've done to my iPad.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Now, I can just correct me, please, if I'm wrong, because I think I could still stop this.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Maybe not.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You could restore it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Well, that's my question.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I could just run the restore, right?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And it would all be okay.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You should be back to normal, but that's the whole.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Here's the problem is that's what should happen, but we don't know.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We don't know exactly what's going to happen after that.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And that's why I would be more tempted to get one that I'm planning to just crack.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And I'm not going to ever put anything on it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's only going to be used as the jailbroken, you know, test unit that's kind of sequestered
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   from ever syncing with my Mac or I give it a separate Mac and a separate account or whatever.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But that's the thing I'm concerned about.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Has anybody run a tracer on this app to see exactly what it's sending and receiving?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   There is a post at digdog.tumbler.com.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Let me get this tilted up so that you can see that I have now jailbroken this iPad.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   While we've been talking, I jailbroken it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now it's rebooting, I guess.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So maybe who knows?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Maybe I'm dead.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But if you go to that website, he's looking in the...
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   First of all, yes, you can see that it is JavaScript.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That is calling a PDF.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And if you open the PDF file in the hex editor, he says you can see exactly what type of PDF vulnerability.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So we at least know how it's happening.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   A PDF vulnerability that lets you run arbitrary code.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   But no, you're right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You'd have to decompile the entire jailbreak to figure out if it's doing anything malicious
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   because it could easily have malicious code in there.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   We don't know.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I think it comes from a source that has been trusted.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   No, again, it's just that I want to look both ways for crossing the street.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   If anything, though, it really is a warning sign to anybody who thinks that iPhones are necessarily more secure than Android phones or any other sort of computing platform.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Because the fact that you can visit a website and install arbitrary code on an iPhone at this level.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I mean, jailbreaking, I believe this is actually the first jailbreak technique that works on the iPhone 4.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Right.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So not only do they will jailbreak by visiting a website.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Right.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Not only did I mean, we've seen that before.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And here's this idea.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So I guess this is jailbroken because there's the city of store.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   By the way, I've been told by SORIC that it is pronounced SEDIA.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Not SEDIA.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So that's why I'm saying it's so strange.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Who are you?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Not all of the packages available via SEDIA are designed to be used by all users.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Categorize yourself so that SEDIA can apply helpful filters.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   User, hacker, developer.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Wow.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   What am I?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Do I want graphical apps only or do I want command line and graphical apps or do I want no filters?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I want it all.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Give me everything.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Then you get the message that says, "OK, don't tell any of the regular users, but this is actually a scam.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Get credit card numbers and account information."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Quiet.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   They just want to get the jailbroken version of the Wi-Fi.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   If I want a broadcast, I don't know what that ECID number is.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Here's a button that says, "Make my life easier.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Thanks."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It's got a heart.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So what could be wrong with that?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I'm going to have to save this for reading later.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Trust is such an interesting issue.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I'm not even joking here.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   No, you're right, Andy.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You're absolutely right.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Yes, by all means.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Have full access to my machine.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   This machine that has not only all my personal content information, but all my backing information
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and every important document and photo that I've encountered over the past three months.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Yes, and do it so that Leo can display that in public on his computer would be even better.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And apparently I have.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   For me, it's not so much a security issue as it is just a convenience issue.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Now, I'm kind of out of the...
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Every time there's an update, there's going to be a process.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Every time there's...
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.920]   To me, there's just like this, getting out of that convenience factor to me is just more
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.680]   than I want to do with something that I consider kind of an appliance, my immediate appliance
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.160]   that I'm using for lots of different things.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.760]   And I just don't want that much trouble.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   I think that's good.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.360]   I feel like if I want that much trouble, I'll get an Android, which would be great.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.120]   I mean, I think it gives me all the freedom that I would get with that, except that it's
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.000]   a stable platform that is built for it to be open rather than being cracked open.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Right.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.440]   So my only issue with jailbreaking is just that every time I look at the app's depository's
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.720]   like Sidia and all the others, I've yet to see the sort of apps that make me say, "Thank
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.000]   God, my goodness.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.480]   Why wouldn't I want to jailbreak this phone?
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   Why wouldn't I want this app?"
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   No, I agree.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   Screen capture.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.720]   Screen capture is good, but that's such a...
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.280]   I think it means screencast capture, not just screen capture.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   Right.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.120]   I mean, just being able to go out of the VGA.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.920]   I have no one's live video on it.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.280]   I'm horribly bitter about this, I just want to say.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.560]   I understand why there isn't an app or why Apple won't let us just capture the screen.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   It makes me...
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.320]   But that's exactly the sort of thing that most of the really cool stuff are things like
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.040]   OS system enhancements, like turning your iPhone into a Wi-Fi base station, which is
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.680]   something you're getting free with every Android phone from now on.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.840]   That's even if we're going to be paying extra for tethering, why don't we get Wi-Fi tethering
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.880]   and things that will give you a better launch bar and give you a better home screen.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   Things like that.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.560]   I just haven't seen that one app that says, "My life will be so materially changed by
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.600]   the addition of this app on my phone."
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.200]   And there's nothing like that I can get by the app store that, yes, I will definitely
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.560]   jailbreak my phone and go through what you're talking about where I'm sure that once 4.1
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.040]   comes out, a new jailbreak will be available within the month, but that's one month in
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.640]   which I'm going to have to really look closely and make sure I don't upgrade my phone for
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   lack of...
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.400]   For concern that's going to disable the thing.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.040]   Now, the one place that is very popular, of course, is in countries where it's not available.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.240]   I actually work in a lot of those countries.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.600]   And every iPhone is jailbroken.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.880]   I mean, every iPhone that you encounter, and there's a lot of them.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.160]   I go to meetings in Zimbabwe and Tanzania, and you see iPhones everywhere, and every
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.280]   single one of those had to be jailbroken because that's the only way to get it to run.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   Some say FaceTime over 3G is a compelling reason to upgrade iPhone 4 or jailware with
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.240]   iPhone 4. And here's another issue that you don't know how this will affect your pricing
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   structure.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.920]   Someone put a meter on it to make sure that if you're running FaceTime over 3G, well,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.800]   how much data are you transacting?
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.560]   And it comes out to some semi-ungodly rate per minute.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.960]   And given that you're capped at two gigs per month if you're a new user, unless you're
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.600]   still in the limited plan, you're going to start running up an incredible amount of
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.680]   money if you don't keep your eye on that.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.160]   This is a 9-to-5 Mac Mark German writing.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.080]   He says, "We put two iPhone 4s to test one running FaceTime over 3G and took before and
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.600]   after screenshots of the data.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.000]   As you'll see, if you do the math, the five-minute FaceTime call with lots of movement."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.920]   And of course, that's part of the issue is it could use more or less depending on what's
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.640]   going on and so forth.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.800]   But used 14.7 megabytes of data, about 3 megabytes a minute.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.000]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   But that could be quite a bit.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.280]   If you have a 250 megabyte plan, that means you're going to get what?
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.800]   80, 90 minutes.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   Well, I...
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   Months.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.960]   I find that I actually want to go the other direction where I just really want to make
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   those phone calls.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.720]   The FaceTime calls that I'm getting, I want those to be audio calls.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   I want them built into the phone.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.240]   I don't really want to use Skype.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.720]   I want to use FaceTime to call people.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   I'm confused.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.320]   You want FaceTime for audio calls?
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   Just to...
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   I just don't want the FaceTime to turn on.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   Oh, I see.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   You don't want to use Skype.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.920]   You want to use FaceTime as a VoIP solution.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   Exactly.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   You know, that's...
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   Why?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Well, because...
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   We don't have 3G.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Oh.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.440]   Because when Skype is running in the background on my iPhone 4, I can almost watch the battery
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   drain in real time.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   Oh.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   I mean, it is...
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   Skype is the...
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   I mean, it is a battery hog.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.480]   I mean, I couldn't understand why my iPhone kept on dying.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.360]   And I realized, "Oh, right."
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.040]   Because Skype is running in the background.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.360]   Welcome to background operations.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.240]   And so it was the only thing running in the background.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.520]   And so I don't want to run Skype in the background because it's...
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.400]   I just want that built into my phone operation.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   And I'm at Wi-Fi access points all the time.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   Like I don't need...
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   I don't need the 3G.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   I need it occasionally.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.160]   But most of the time, I'd love to have a clear call that actually works.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   That doesn't drop.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   That, you know, I call like I was talking to Fredrik Johnson on FaceTime.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   And it was clear.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   And it was...
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   It was just a very nice and fun.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.680]   So which switch talk about is the ability to start a call over the 3G network and then
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.560]   tap a button and switch it over cleanly to Wi-Fi?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   And then FaceTime does.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   I just want to be able to turn the camera off.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.200]   You know, just give me FaceTime and just have a little button that says "camera off."
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   So I can just have that...
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   I can have an...
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.640]   Basically, I chat and I can decide which way, you know, what am I going to use?
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.040]   3G or Wi-Fi?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   And I think a lot of people would be able to use Wi-Fi.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.600]   Norway says, "Is this news to you that you can hit the home button to get voice only
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   on FaceTime?"
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   It is news to me.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   I didn't know.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.760]   I looked for the button.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   I didn't know that I had the...
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   The home button.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   Well, there's only one button.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   Well, I didn't know that.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   But there's only one...
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   There's a screen.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.760]   So where do they call this?
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.760]   I don't know.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   So that would be the...
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.400]   Jeff Jack 25, once you know, he said it first.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.320]   Okay, well, then you know.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.880]   You're fighting in the chat room.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.160]   So that, to me, FaceTime is that future of this nice, clear...
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   And it's not just...
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.880]   It's a VoIP connection.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.400]   If someone's got Wi-Fi in some other country, that gives me that VoIP connection.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.200]   The Skype is more than I need.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.320]   I just want it built into my phone.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   I don't want to think about it.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.520]   And FaceTime doesn't kill the battery like Skype does?
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   No, it's just part of the op.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.360]   So it says to me, like Skype is broken.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   Or something broken about Skype.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.760]   And they need to do another...
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.440]   They did a re-release recently to make it possible to run in the background.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   Now they need to fix that.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   And let me tell you...
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   And here's the other thing.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.560]   Is there a way to turn off to kill background processes?
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.920]   I'd like to do that.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.640]   Because the problem is that, you know, it is exactly what Apple said when you start running
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.960]   background processes, it's going to burn that battery.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   And it just burns the...
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   Skype's the way...
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.720]   That's why if you look in the Android store, there's 18 different taskkillers for that
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   very reason.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.920]   You can do that very easily, the same technique that you use to delete icons from the homepage.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   If you do that to the...
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.000]   You're going to do it one by one.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That's the problem.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And it's very...
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I've done it.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It takes a long time.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.440]   Because it keeps everything you've ever opened in that...
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.560]   It's about double clicking the...
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.280]   Yeah, where you get where it slides up and then you get all of the icons there.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   Are they all...
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.840]   Are they all those processes walking?
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   No.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   That's all.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   This is the other problem.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   This is my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.120]   But you're going to get an icon in that tray for every process you've run since the last
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.440]   time you've start turned on the system.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.960]   Many of those will already have been shut down through lack of use.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.400]   As there has to be, there's a process on these resources and restricted devices.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.960]   But the one you're looking at, the one that's active is certainly going to be to the extreme
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.520]   left and should be very easy to find.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.160]   You could close Skype for sure.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   It's easy to find Skype.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   Right.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160]   You see it?
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.720]   I'm not a huge fan of the way Apple's done multitasking, but I understand.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.120]   In fact, I'm kind of with you.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.280]   I wish I could just turn it off.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   But you want to have Pandora running.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   No.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   I actually would love to be able to turn it off.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.080]   I think that multitasking is a problem on Android too.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.160]   It causes reliability glitches.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.600]   It causes resource drops.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.000]   The biggest reliability issue for me is that my phone dies at 3 o'clock in the afternoon
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.680]   instead of before I go to bed.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.800]   And notice, by the way, we're not unhappy with how fast I...
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.440]   I mean, iPad is fine.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   I can switch.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240]   It remembers the context that was in, right?
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.480]   So I can switch from my browser to my email and back again very quickly.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   It's not multitasking.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.680]   It's just fast app switching.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   I think it's...
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.000]   Well, I think it's really tailored to the user because I haven't noticed any degradation
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.520]   of my battery performance on my iPhone 4, maybe it's because of the larger battery.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.760]   And I also tend to think that you're using the iPhone 4, the iPhone 3GS.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.280]   I think we're talking about 4 and iPhone 4.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.080]   Are you running Skype in the background?
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.400]   I'm not running Skype.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   Skype.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.120]   But it's specifically Skype that's just...
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.680]   Whatever it's doing to do it, it's not all of the apps running in the background.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.440]   It's specifically Skype.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.160]   It's just draining that battery all the way to the ground.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.080]   So we're turning back to my original thesis, which is that Skype is a piece of crap.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   All right, you win, you win.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.520]   Do we have a show title?
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.480]   No.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.840]   I can't afford to rile the Skype gods as we continue in just a bit more tech news.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.280]   Andy Inoco, Alex Lindsey here, we're talking about Apple.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.040]   And I now have a jailbreak and iPad.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   I don't see anything wrong with it.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.640]   I mean, I don't see any advantage except there's some maybe some things in Sydney I don't
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.680]   want to run, but there's nothing bad happened here, right?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   Not yet.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.040]   There's nobody stealing my passwords, is there?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Not that you know.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   We don't know.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   That's kind of the problem, isn't it?
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.760]   I want to thank the folks at Ford, by the way, for bringing us out to Detroit last week.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.040]   I hope you saw some of our video from the Detroit auto plant, the Rouge.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   That was fun.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.280]   Oh, man, did I have a blast.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   The Rouge is the plant Henry Ford built in the late twenties right after the depression.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.520]   What's cool about this is this is the in some ways the highest expression of tech, of logistics,
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.240]   of ingenuity that we've ever seen.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.840]   This is a mile and a half by three quarters mile.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.800]   The whole idea of the plant was raw materials come in one end, iron ore, lumber, limestone,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   a car comes out the other end.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.080]   A hundred thousand Shenzhen, forget it, a hundred thousand people were working at this plant
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.120]   at its peak.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.360]   It made it they called it the arsenal of democracy during World War II because they were making
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.640]   airplanes tanks, jeeps.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.920]   It's just the history there is fascinating.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.640]   Yeah, is it still running?
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.040]   It's running not at peak capacities, not a hundred thousand people.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.560]   But we went down to the most modern factory there, which is making the Ford F-150 trucks,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.600]   which is the best selling vehicle in America right now.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.800]   I got to actually ride the conveyor belt as they're making them.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.560]   I was on the assembly line.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.120]   If you haven't seen the video, we're going to put it out on the twit specials.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.360]   But boy, we got unprecedented access.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.080]   We went down there with a camera.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   It was amazing.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   It's clean.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   It's well lit.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   They've got clear stories and skylights.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080]   There's sunlight in there.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.520]   The noise level is very tolerable.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.320]   It's less than maybe during a major twit eruption.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.040]   It was really just amazing to watch the Just In Time logistics as these trucks are getting
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.560]   assembled.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.160]   It's mind boggling.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.560]   The number of parts and stuff.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.720]   I just got a thrill to see this.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   This is big tech.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.480]   Anyway, I want to thank Ford for doing that.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   Then the next day, we went to Maker Faire.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:02.600]   Now Maker Faire is you and me, the innovation, the ingenuity of individual humans taking
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.400]   found parts and stuff and putting it together in unusual, unique ways.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.920]   It was a great combination of things.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   The idea, the reason that Make Magazine wanted to bring Maker Faire to Detroit is that they
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.840]   also recognize that this for many years was the center of American innovation and technology.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.960]   In the post-industrial era, they want to support the reinvention of Detroit in the 21st century.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.880]   There's all this capacity there, all these brains, all this genius.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.120]   What can we do with it?
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.440]   It was so much fun to go.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.440]   I hope you come to our Twit specials feed.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440]   There's three shows.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.200]   There's a Ford Plant Tour.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.400]   There's the Ford Track Tour.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.120]   They took me out on a test drive.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.160]   I went out in the Mustang Shelby 2011 Shelby.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.560]   He was drifting the thing.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   I was screaming like a little girl.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.360]   It was so much fun.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.840]   Then they have an area of the test track where they simulate roads from around the world because
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.040]   the Fiesta, for instance, is one style for the whole world.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.920]   We went on a Scottish road.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.880]   They had a road from Belgium with cobblestones.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.800]   They have bumpy roads.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.880]   They have all different road surfaces.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.160]   Their cars might be driven on, including culverts, drains.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.920]   Do the signs change languages?
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.920]   No.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.280]   In fact, it's all fairly compact.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.240]   If you shift over to feet, you'll be riding on a different road.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's almost like they're grooves.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   You'll see that.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.800]   Then we went to the Henry Ford, which is the museum.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.040]   We went to-- where else do we go?
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.560]   Oh, we went to the cave with a virtual reality environment where they--
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   I wish you had been there.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   I wish I had been there too.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.440]   They used 3D technology you would have known all about.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.720]   It was really interesting how they model the cars.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.920]   I sat on a seat with 3D glasses on.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.080]   They have a flex all around you.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   And you turn your head.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   You're looking at the door.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   You're looking out the window.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   You turn the right.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.840]   You can reach out.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.640]   You can't touch them because your hand goes right through.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   But the controls are all there.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.200]   You're in a flex.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.560]   You can look in the back seat.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.080]   And the idea is that the executives come in.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.400]   They look.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.840]   They see what it's going to look like.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.880]   They see is-- can you hit the kids from the front seat
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.440]   if they're in the back seat?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.920]   It's an important thing.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.080]   You wonder why you don't have a lot of legs face if you're tall.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   It's just get in.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.280]   Stuff like that.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.680]   Anyway, we have all the video if you
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.120]   want to see it on the specials.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.240]   We then went to the Coke Mentos Show.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.560]   We got a special Coke Mentos demonstration.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.520]   Anyway, a lot of fun.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.640]   Thanks to Ford for bringing us out.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.280]   It made me love them even more.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.440]   I have to say, I am a Ford fan boy.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   I admit it.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.720]   When I drive my Mustang, it makes me happy.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.600]   Partly because it's got that great Ford sink in there.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.280]   And every time I try somebody else's GPS,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.240]   or their voice activation, or their hands free, I go,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.200]   how do you use this?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.520]   This is terrible.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.560]   Ford sink, it's intuitive.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.760]   You get true hands free calling.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.560]   In fact, OK, don't tell the iPhone guys.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.920]   But on my Droid X, it reads text messages to me.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.680]   Because you have a text message.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.440]   And then it reads it to me.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.040]   Turn by turn, voice directions.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.160]   It'll even reroute you if there's bad traffic 9-1-1
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.320]   assist, which is very important.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.360]   You put your own pictures in there?
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   Absolutely.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.400]   You see that?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.680]   I have the Twit logo on my deck.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.000]   Your text message is read aloud with the sound of your voice.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.160]   That depends on the phone you're using.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.920]   It does not do it with the iPhone 4.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.680]   Personalized traffic alerts and weather, so much more.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.280]   It's standard in some Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury models,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.640]   optional in others.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.160]   The best way to find out more is to go to sinkmyridepodcast.com
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.240]   or visit your Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury dealer
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.360]   and test drive, one of those new 2011 Ford Fiesta's
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.160]   or the flex or the focus of the fusion.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.240]   Ah, the F-150's, that 4x4, the Raptor.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.440]   Look, if you go off-road, you got to try it, Raptor.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   We did the bumpy test track in the Raptor.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.800]   We were going through drainage ditches and stuff.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   It was so-- oh, man, you see all that video online.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.560]   But it was just a blast.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.720]   Sinkmyridepodcast.com or visit your Ford, Lincoln,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.480]   and Mercury dealers.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.840]   And thank you, Ford, for bringing us to the Motor City.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.440]   We're going to go back.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.160]   In fact, they want us to see the Chicago Ford plant, where
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.960]   they build-- is that where they build the Fiesta?
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.160]   I want to see the Mustang plant.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.200]   Yeah, where's the Mustang?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.960]   Have you ever been-- either you or any,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   have you ever been on the scene in assembly line?
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.200]   Not a-- I don't.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.040]   Dotto assembly line.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.480]   It's not-- you know, I have this kind of Victorian notion,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.920]   this tark and dim and this people--
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.880]   put it in the seat now.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.360]   And it's so different.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.640]   You could eat off the floor.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   I mean, really clean.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   This part was not robotics.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.280]   This is all the trim.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.920]   So humans are doing it all.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.320]   And they're-- we joked at them.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.400]   We were laughing.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.440]   It really is a--
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.640]   it looks like not only a great place to work,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.080]   but just a really high tech facility.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.800]   I mean, each truck is different.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.640]   And they have to match the pieces up, like the cab is
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.480]   assembled, and then the boxes assembled,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.000]   and then they match it to the chassis.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.440]   And it all has to arrive at the same time,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.120]   where you're going to have the wrong thing on the wrong thing.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.720]   And the logistics-- I don't know how-- it's amazing.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   Stay at the yard.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.640]   I think that's the only way to compete these days.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.160]   You have to.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.120]   Yeah, I mean, you have to be there.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.160]   You have to.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.560]   I think they do-- on that line, they
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.960]   do 500 trucks a day, 12 minutes of trucks up like that.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.360]   It's incredible.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.760]   And it's not moving fast, by the way.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.360]   We got on the conveyor and wrote it for a little while,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.720]   and then get off it.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   It's not moving that fast, but it's just-- it's--
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.960]   And it all started with Ford.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.160]   I mean, that-- that system.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.760]   He invented it.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.680]   Then when he got off the line, you realized that your shoelaces
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.000]   have been replaced, and your glasses were now clean.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   He just didn't know how it happened.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   There's a team.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.600]   It's kind of like Indy 500.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.180]   There's a team with those both things,
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.360]   and they put the tires on.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.400]   The whole wheel assembly's done already in the tire.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   And it's just like the Indy 500.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.160]   I think, oh, jh, jh, jh, jh, jh.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.660]   And it's done.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.560]   Whenever I see an assembly line, I'm always amazed by two things.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.000]   Number one, that, of course, they're
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.040]   going to make a specialized tool for just this one operation,
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.920]   and it is the most magical tool you've ever seen.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.680]   And secondly, you have a worker who does nothing but use
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.320]   this tool.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.040]   And so if it's installing a dashboard,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.960]   I have taken out dashboards and put in the back
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.160]   in five or six different times in various cars.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.600]   And it's a two-day affair.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.040]   But then you realize that, no, here's
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.200]   the insertion of dashboard tool that does be
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.120]   press this one button.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.320]   We have a video.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.600]   Here's the guy who knows exactly how to get at those four
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.320]   others, the three nuts that can't be accessed by non-human hands.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   He simply reaches in, go blip, blip, blip,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.560]   and then he knows he has to simply lean on it this way
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.320]   to get it set in.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.480]   And good, you're not.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.080]   No, we have a video of that exact thing if you want to see it.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.720]   And he has a special crane that holds it,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.560]   so he can do it with his finger.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.200]   And he goes, and they do it.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.000]   They tack it down, and then the next guy bolts it in.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.160]   I mean, literally, Andy, 30 seconds.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.400]   You want to pay that guy, like, $100 to put in your car stereo
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.080]   just to watch him do it.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.480]   Well, he's done it enough.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.000]   And I asked him.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.600]   I said, they rotate.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.320]   He says, some guys like to change their job frequently
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.040]   every year or whatever.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.000]   They do something else.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.440]   And some guys really love that they know how to do it.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.600]   And they're very efficient at it.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   And they're listening to music and stuff.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.520]   But they're fast, and they're really-- you watch them.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.280]   They're really like, boom.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   It's really cool.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.640]   I have 12 minutes.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.080]   Well, I don't know if that's right.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.040]   I probably shouldn't spout stats like that.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.640]   Oh, and Ford did ask me to say something.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.600]   So I crashed the flex into a fiesta.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.960]   It was my fault.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.920]   I was using the park assist, and I just
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.400]   didn't have my foot on the brake.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.320]   And apparently, after you park, you're
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.000]   supposed to stop the car.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.080]   And I didn't.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.000]   So the car-- it's amazing.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.880]   You pull up the flex, which is a big car,
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.440]   says, OK, I can fit in this spot.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.920]   So it tells you, and you say, OK, I'll take it.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   You press the button and it says, I'll take it.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.760]   And it says, OK, pull forward.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.400]   You pull forward and it says, OK, stop.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.080]   Take your hands off the wheel.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.480]   And it goes, gee, perfect.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.800]   No, it's so scary.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.880]   It's a little weird.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.000]   But what I didn't know is, you are
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   supposed to keep your foot on the accelerator of the brake.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.040]   You still control the speed with which it's doing it.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.760]   So not when I took my hands off the wheel.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.920]   I took my feet off of everything.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   And so the car was driving itself.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.520]   This is not the intent.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.600]   So when you get in spot, when it beeps at you, when you're parked,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.640]   you're supposed to put on the brake, turn off the engine,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.400]   and leave.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   I just sat there.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.320]   And so they continue to go backwards.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.840]   And there's two engineers and a Ford Fiesta sitting behind me.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.040]   Now, there's a big car, the Flex, little car Fiesta.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.000]   And you see it on the video.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.760]   Boom, I hit it hard.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.080]   And they're laughing behind me.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.400]   They're laughing at me.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.640]   So I go, oh, God.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.760]   And you see this is all live.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.320]   I'm going, oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Oh, the wonders of live.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.840]   Of live.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.040]   It's live.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:22.720]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.560]   I can't end it out.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.200]   Oh, God.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.160]   So now there's a new safety label in the dashboard
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.720]   that inside Dureport at Ford is referred to as the Leo label.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   Leo label.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.480]   That's not one every single one of those covers.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.720]   So I get out.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   And you know, the amazing thing, there
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.000]   was not a scratch on either one.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.320]   They both handled it very well, which I thought
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.840]   made up a little bit for the fact that I completely screwed up
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.280]   the demo.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.360]   Yeah, you could.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.600]   That could be an opportunity for them
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.840]   to create a feature that just doesn't auto break once,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.920]   I guess, to the other end of that.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.680]   Apparently, they were betting on whether I would do that or not.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.360]   The engineers were laughing because they had money
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   that I would hit them.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.560]   That's why they were happy.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.760]   They didn't mind.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.160]   And everything survived.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   I don't mean to go on and on, but I did
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.480]   want to mention that.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.080]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.960]   Oh, one other thing.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   Yeah, we use the LiveU, which is an amazing device.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.800]   But I know that there were some connectivity issues,
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.440]   especially in the plant.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.280]   And so if you were watching Live, you probably
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.600]   saw the stream dropout come and go.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.760]   But we have edited versions of super high quality,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.440]   high-def recording.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.640]   We used a Canon-- I mean, a Sony EX1, CineAlta.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.320]   So we have very nice videos that we
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.840]   are posting in the Twitch specials feed.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.800]   So you can see it all, including the crash in high-def.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.560]   So happy about that.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   All right, we got to keep going here.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.200]   Good news for the iPhone.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.440]   Bad news for the BlackBerry.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   The United Arab Emirates says the BlackBerry
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.120]   is a security flaw.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.240]   On October 11, we're going to turn off internet email
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.840]   and texting on the BlackBerry.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.680]   I think this is actually good news for BlackBerry.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   The government said buy an iPhone instead.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.480]   But I still think this is good for BlackBerry.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.400]   If you ever wanted to have an advertisement of you
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.520]   are a secure agency or a big company in the United States
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.200]   and you want to know that your communications are secure,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.080]   you couldn't get a better ad than a country saying,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.040]   it's so encrypted and it's so tight that we're not going
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   to even let it in the country.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.960]   I mean, if rim was smart, they would use this as an ad.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.120]   This is their--
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.000]   Well, that's what rim said.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.800]   They said the UAE said, well, we want--
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   because really the truth is UAE wants to spy on its citizens.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.080]   And they said, well, BlackBerry give us the keys
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   so we can see the data.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.200]   And BlackBerry said, we can't.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.480]   We can't unencrypted.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.680]   It's secure.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   No, I think it's a great--
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.640]   I think they should--
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.800]   I think this is a great-- the beginning
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.040]   of a great ad campaign for rim.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.400]   I actually think it's really good for them.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.920]   Apparently, rim made-- did make an agreement with India
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.720]   to share quote, "share technical codes
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.320]   for corporate emails."
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.960]   But rim is saying over and over again,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.600]   look, this is encryption.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.520]   It's strong encryption.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.120]   We don't have back doors to it.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.840]   Sorry, UAE.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.200]   Half a million users, though, are going to be--
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.840]   are going to have phones that don't work come October
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.320]   if this happens.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   But I think that's a drop in the bucket for rim, I think.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.360]   I mean, you know, it's-- I think it's bad for UAE
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.600]   because I think there's going to-- a lot of people
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   that aren't going to want to go to that.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.960]   It includes Dubai.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.480]   Right.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.800]   I mean, I think there's a lot of people that are going to go,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.720]   well, you know--
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.560]   Talk about-- I mean, we talk about privacy issues in the states.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.520]   At least we don't have a government that's banning blackberries
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.520]   because they can't spy on them.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.880]   Right.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.840]   And it does reflect a little bit badly on the iPhone
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.680]   if they say, well, use the iPhone.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.960]   But the difference is rim all the back-end is not handled
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.920]   by the carrier, which would be the UAE carrier.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.440]   It's handled by rim.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.040]   Right.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.800]   And on the iPhone, the carrier handles all transactions.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.560]   So the carrier can give-- the carrier is a UAE.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.600]   I'm pretty sure it's a government agency.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.400]   So they can open it up.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.760]   That's a heavy business.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.000]   I think that it damages UAE's ability
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.520]   to do-- because there's a lot of people that are addicted
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.400]   to their blackberries.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.000]   And if they come into the airport and they can't use them,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.240]   they're not going to be--
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.520]   they're going to reroute.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.400]   Did you see the post by a--
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.800]   I guess an Apple employee.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.280]   I don't know if we know his real name or not.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.360]   Sechin, S-A-C-H-I-N.postris.com.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.680]   Apple has run like a huge startup.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.240]   He's responding to a Gizmodo article that said,
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.880]   we love the Apple remote app, which we do.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.800]   It's a great app.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   But why hasn't it been updated over eight months?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.880]   Sechin says, yeah, it's due for an update.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.240]   But here's why it hasn't been updated.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:39.160]   The person who wrote it, the person who wrote it,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.560]   is busy working on other things.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.080]   Apple doesn't, he says, goes on to say,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   Apple doesn't build large teams to work on every product
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.000]   they make.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.240]   Instead, they hire very few but very intelligent people
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.120]   who can work on different products
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.760]   and move around as needed.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.560]   One day you might be working on the road app.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.280]   The next you might be pulled onto another project
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.680]   that needs your help.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.240]   That's absolutely true.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.640]   Project, different project.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.480]   Some people were skeptical when they heard last year
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.160]   that the reason why a certain software update wasn't ready
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.680]   was because everybody was being pulled off
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.920]   to get this next version of the iPhone operating system
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.440]   off the door.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.160]   And that is absolutely true.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.440]   I think that's also a reason why Apple can behave as one
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.120]   company so effectively in ways that Dell and Microsoft
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.040]   and the rest can't.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.480]   Because if you work at Apple and you reach a certain level
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.880]   of permanence there, your allegiance is not to the iPhone
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.800]   because the iPhone is what you're working on this year.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.760]   Maybe you'll be spending three months working on the UI
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.880]   for the Finder next year if they decide
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.000]   that they need to have more manpower or more personnel
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.160]   on that project instead.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.920]   So basically, I think everybody who works at Apple
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.360]   at that level is invested in the company as a whole,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.280]   as in the portfolio of products as a whole.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   And so that's the reason why you don't have people really
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.400]   saying, well, we really can't add this feature to the iPad
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   because what does that do to sales of my iPhone division?
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.200]   Well, no, because you're being paid by the same guy
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.360]   who also makes iPads, so you're good.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.320]   And by the way, Black Cat tells me that Sechin
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   is the CEO of Postris.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.480]   So I guess he used to work at Apple.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.760]   He says he's good friends with a guy who wrote.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.520]   Yeah, product designer inspired by Apple worked on Final Cut Pro.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.160]   He was on the Final Cut Pro team at Apple.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.840]   Do you know him?
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.680]   I don't think so.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   A4, Agarwall.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   I don't.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   I only know a small part of the--
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.640]   You know that team though?
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.520]   Absolutely.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   They're a great team.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.560]   They're in Santa Monica.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.080]   I think that's something to be said for that,
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.200]   except that there's also a negative.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.360]   I mean, look, this is what Microsoft doesn't do.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.240]   They have massive teams.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.720]   And yeah, they keep stuff up to date,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.160]   but they just don't have that entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.000]   Wow, I find it funny that they--
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.800]   Microsoft will be working on incredible technology,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.760]   and there's not a huge impetus to make it
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.080]   to make it to a product.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.240]   I mean, if they turn it into a product,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.280]   they're going to have to support it.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.600]   Worse, there's interesting thing fighting
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.800]   to keep it from becoming a product,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.080]   because it's not my team.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.000]   It's not my product.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.920]   That's really apparently hurt stuff inside Microsoft.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.240]   So go ahead, Danny.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.480]   I was just going to say that used
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.920]   to be a huge problem before jobs came back,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.760]   where I would be getting contacts from multiple people
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.240]   at multiple divisions, each stabbing each other in the back
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.440]   and trying to get me to, hey, you're one of the best
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.120]   journalists and where I really like your stuff.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.840]   So I'm going to slip you the super confidential document
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.440]   about how late the operating system is.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.520]   And boy, it would be--
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   boy, when I get in trouble, there's no selfish reason
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.120]   for me to give you this document.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.440]   And then I look into it and realize that I've already
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.320]   know that, OK, well, Jeff, I happen
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.800]   to know that you and this other guy
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.360]   have been fighting for the past seven months
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.160]   to get with different ideas of what the OS strategy should be.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.000]   So I know that you're giving me the knife
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   that you intend to use to want me to stab other people
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.960]   in the back for you.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.160]   Oh, that's kind of a tough thing for me to do, Jeff.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:52.560]   Sorry.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.160]   That's tough.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.920]   It's good you caught that, however,
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.160]   because it would be very tempting.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.080]   For whatever people think about Steve Jobs,
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   the one thing he definitely did is tighten that ship up
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.960]   a lot very, very fast.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.240]   I mean, that company went from being all over the place
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.320]   to being going one direction in 12 months flat.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.920]   Right.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.720]   Right.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.600]   On the other hand-- so that's the positive.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.680]   On the other hand, the negative is eight months
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.240]   between updates on an app.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.840]   To me, the larger issue is-- and this is--
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.720]   I always got this feeling, and I'm thinking maybe this is why--
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.080]   you get the sense that Apple moves--
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   as a company moves its attention from product to product.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.160]   And since there was so much attention
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.880]   based on the iPad and before it, the iPhone,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.840]   that OS X got a little short shrift.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.680]   So this would kind of confirm it that these people are moving
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.120]   as needed.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.000]   Right.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.520]   Aren't there enough great engineers
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.880]   that you could have all the teams?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.120]   Or is this just part of the way Apple works?
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.080]   Really, really great engineers?
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.480]   It's not.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.680]   It's hard.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   And that's hard in any industry, really great lawyers,
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.720]   or doctors, or engineers, or artists, or whatever it is.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.240]   It's a very, very small percentage of people
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.400]   who have all the pieces that make it really work.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.080]   Speaking of BlackBerry, according to Nielsen,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.440]   50% of BlackBerry users plan to defect to Android or iPhone.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.040]   That's not scary, is it?
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   For BlackBerry, it is.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.840]   Black--
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.120]   That'll keep you up at night.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.360]   And I don't know if they've announced it yet,
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.880]   but today they're supposed to announce their new BlackBerry
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.800]   with OS 6.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.400]   Have you seen anything about that yet?
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   I've seen stuff about it.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.240]   I have to admit my last BlackBerry experience
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.320]   was bad enough that--
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.400]   The storm was awful.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.360]   I'm just 9,800.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.680]   People are saying good things about it.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.160]   Let me just see.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.720]   It's called the BlackBerry Torch.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.800]   It has a big-- yep, there it is-- big screen
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.880]   with a slider keyboard that comes out of the bottom.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.200]   This is for men gadget.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.760]   They just announced this minutes ago.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.440]   It is using WebKit, finally, which is huge,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.120]   because the browser on BlackBerry
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.600]   has been really the weak spot, I think.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.360]   And it's been the strength, I think, of iPhone,
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.080]   was it had a real browser in it.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.880]   Engadget says, the hard-- this is a Nele Patel writing.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.720]   The hardware is quite nice.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.960]   The keyboard feels similar to the tour or bold.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   Software-wise, still waiting to play with BlackBerry 6
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.960]   in depth, but definitely feels like the OS overwhelms
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.200]   the hardware a little when it's really cranking.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.720]   This is always a problem.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.400]   Is this more of BlackBerry?
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.040]   It's not so much them growing their market,
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.200]   because I don't think they're going to--
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   This is going to grow their market against Android or the iPhone,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.480]   but it's trying to get those defectors to not leave.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.600]   They'll do something.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.960]   I mean, that's because it seems like it still
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.840]   feels like a BlackBerry.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.640]   So if you're a BlackBerry user, this
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.560]   tells you that we're moving forward.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.760]   But it doesn't look like something
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.440]   that as an iPhone user and Android user,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   I would want to move over to.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.760]   Right.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.360]   Do you use a BlackBerry at all, either one of you?
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.040]   I used a BlackBerry right up until the iPhone came out.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.880]   I was using a bold.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.680]   I really liked the bold.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.400]   I totally skipped over BlackBerry,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.600]   except for just for research, for running columns
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.520]   and stuff like that.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.720]   I think that they always had a really great identity
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.840]   as the ultimate messaging phone that's out there.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.800]   And messaging has never been the most important thing
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.200]   from me and my personal phones.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.280]   So it's kind of interesting that now that you're
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   seeing more sophisticated messaging phones, messaging
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.720]   options for the iPhone and for the Android,
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.520]   and now that having a really awesome keyboard
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.880]   is no longer really the defining ability
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.520]   to enter text really, really fast on this device.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.880]   And I've been using swipe on the Android phone,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.080]   which is just an incredible input solution.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.360]   Now, I mean, BlackBerry is really starting to lose its identity.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.520]   It can still do OK if it's going to be defined as,
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.320]   here is the phone that your company will buy for you
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.120]   and give you, because it's the easiest phone to administer
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.280]   and the easiest phone to keep 500 copies of running
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.720]   all across the country.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.760]   But they're really going to have to find a way
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.560]   to connect to users if they're going to start to compete
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.040]   with Android and Apple.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.600]   I'm just watching the video that they put on Engadget,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   Nele Patel playing with the prototype at the announce event
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.720]   this morning.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.480]   It does look very iPhone-y, I have to say.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.360]   I mean, it's got app icons gritted across the top.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.600]   I think BlackBerry learned with the storm
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.840]   that BlackBerry users anyway don't like an on-screen keyboard.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.240]   I prefer an on-screen keyboard.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.920]   I'm with you, Andy.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.600]   I think swipe is faster than any mechanical keyboard.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.920]   But this is kind of the bread and butter of BlackBerry,
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.000]   right, is these physical keyboards.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.520]   And obviously, people who do nothing but message, message,
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.480]   message, message all day long have a different set of priorities
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.360]   that you have to respect.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.160]   And what I've always liked about BlackBerry with two
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.160]   recent exceptions is that when they put in a mechanical keyboard,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.800]   it's not like the first droid where it's push buttons,
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.040]   but they're totally useless.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.320]   They make a great mechanical keyboard for mobile devices.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.640]   That would be a good reason in jailbreak.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.280]   An iPhone, can you get swipe on Sedia or some similar alternate
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.760]   passwords?
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.120]   Probably not.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.080]   I should look forward to--
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.800]   Swipe is a third party.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.160]   Exactly.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.880]   And it's a specific technology.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.960]   It's a whole database of metrics on how people move their fingers
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.440]   across the keyboard when they're typing.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.800]   It ain't going to be on the John Thessides story, I think.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.560]   If Apple is not the sort of people who would license a technology--
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.000]   I don't think they would license a technology like that.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.240]   But oh, steal it, steal it, steal it, please steal it.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.800]   I was so skeptical the first time I tried it,
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.000]   because the first time I saw it was a video that made it sound as
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.720]   though it was going to be graffiti,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.600]   where I have to learn a new way of typing.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.560]   I was just so shocked that within 10 seconds I was getting it,
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.760]   and within five minutes I was just blurring through emails
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.520]   with this.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.640]   As a matter of fact, if I were close in a decision between a
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.920]   Droid X and an iPhone, that would tip it over for me.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.880]   That would make me get the Droid X and send the iPhone.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.160]   If outside of the text input, I was close between those two,
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.800]   it would send me over to the Droid, no problem.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.640]   You're not close, son.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.440]   I ain't even close to being closer.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.520]   I'm so far from close.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.320]   It's not like, you know what?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.360]   The taste of human flesh with enough tarragon.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.640]   If there were enough tarragon--
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.680]   Only there were more spices.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.880]   If you're the brining technique as opposed to the salting
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.840]   technique, no, it's not that.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.800]   Andy, I think likening using an Android phone to eating
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.000]   human flesh might be going just a little far.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   I don't know.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.840]   Well, you see--
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.520]   But if it is--
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.480]   We're here at the Twit Network, and I wanted to get that
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.360]   sound bite.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.800]   That would be tackle by the end of the 6.30 news.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   So get us the lead in to entertainment tonight.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.240]   If it is, call me a cannibal.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.040]   So Android is a lot better than eating human flesh.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.600]   Yes, thank you.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.680]   Not that I would know.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.720]   There's an end for the show for you.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.240]   Android is better than eating flesh.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.520]   Well, apparently, a few other people, according to the
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.280]   Nielsen company, once again, while RIM and BlackBerry are
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.760]   still the number one smartphone in the US, Android has now
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.400]   eclipsed-- and this was just a matter of time-- iPhone as
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.120]   the best-- second best selling a smartphone in the US for
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.760]   the first time on record.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.920]   27% of US smartphone sales--
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.840]   I don't know what the period is, probably the month.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.000]   Nope, it's the quarter.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.640]   27% of US smartphone sales in the last quarter were Android
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.840]   23 were iPhones.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.200]   So maybe because that doesn't include the four.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.640]   Maybe we'll see a little bit of a shift next quarter.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.520]   Android handset sales, though, are growing.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.680]   They grew 886% worldwide from the quarter year ago.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.440]   Not chatty.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.280]   Motorola's mobile phone division has swung from loss to
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   profit on the basis of its droid.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.440]   HTC is kind of abandoning Windows Mobile.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.880]   Their revenues are up 66% mostly on Android over a year ago.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.040]   I mean, if you were looking at this as a marathon, I would
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.720]   really feel like you have neck and neck between Android and
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.360]   iPhone with Blackberry.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.280]   Even though it's ahead--
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.440]   Well, there's some Black Forces.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.800]   There's Blackberry and there's Windows Mobile, which is
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.160]   going to come out with a complete redesign in October.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:58.760]   Right.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.120]   You guys sound skeptical.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.640]   No, no, no.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.200]   Actually, no.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.240]   I'm saying it.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.200]   I think that a third-- a startup company could make a
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   really good run with Windows 7.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:17.600]   It is the first real new design in handheld user interface
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.160]   since the iPhone came along.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   I really think it's that significant.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   I don't think, however, that Microsoft is the company to
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.600]   really prosecute it and have faith in it and have the
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.960]   courage to say, this is not going to be--
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.480]   you're right.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.160]   It doesn't have the app library of the iPhone.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.560]   And no, it's not as open as Android.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.600]   Boy, those are nice things.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.440]   If that's what you want, those are great things.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.760]   We decided to do something brand new.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.160]   We decided to do a really consumer-oriented interface.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.400]   That's designed for your contacts.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.840]   That's designed for your web browsing.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.800]   That's designed for the four apps that you would probably be
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.000]   most likely to use.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.360]   But it's going to do those five, six, seven things better
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.040]   than any other phone out there.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.920]   I think-- I have not gotten my hands on one for real yet.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.720]   But there are so many really cool ideas in that UI that I
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.960]   really-- I'm more interested in getting my hands on that than
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.720]   on the final gold master of Froyo for Android.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   And I like Froyo.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.360]   Does the fact that this new BlackBerry phone comes out on
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.480]   AT&T exclusively make a difference, you think?
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.400]   Is AT&T hedging its bets waiting for the other shoot drop
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.240]   on Verizon?
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.400]   I guess I would say if I was going to do something exclusively,
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.320]   AT&T wouldn't be the horse that I'd pick.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.480]   I would bet that AT&T actively pursued RIM hoping to have--
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.440]   they must have gotten a really good deal on it because I don't
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.160]   know that I think if RIM wants to increase market share
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.840]   or maintain market share, picking AT&T as your only--
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.440]   as your only distribution doesn't seem like it's the best
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.280]   move.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.640]   If history's any judge, they'll have other versions of the
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.720]   same phone in a few months.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.080]   But right now, AT&T has exclusive.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.440]   Or maybe they're putting a certain bullet in the chamber
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.680]   saying, well, gosh, here's our statistics on how often
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.160]   BlackBerry users use media.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.560]   They use just as much data as the iPhone does.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.120]   But for some reason, this totally separate hardware and
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.200]   totally separate operating system performs much better on our
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.360]   network than the iPhone does.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.160]   All other things being equal.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.800]   Maybe it's the phone in the operating system.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.040]   That would be very interesting.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.400]   I don't think it's a strategic--
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.200]   I think it's just a simple question of AT&T is in the
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.160]   business of selling phones to anybody who comes into the
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.240]   store and wants one.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.800]   So that means that they want to have the iPhone.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   They also want to have that cheap $29 no key phone that
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.640]   does take-- that has the 640x480 camera.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.000]   Right.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.360]   It was funny.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.000]   I was talking to someone.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.880]   It was a couple months ago at an AT&T store asking.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.240]   So you always have all these ads and all these promotions
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.280]   for all these other phones.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.360]   What do you mostly sell?
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.160]   And they just kind of rolled their eyes and like, yeah, we
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.840]   sell iPhones.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.680]   Which is like the AT&T store.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.920]   And that's it, really.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.800]   He said, you know, we sell some of the other stuff.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.240]   But it was just kind of like that was the vast majority.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.720]   I have to think that any thought that iPhone is going to
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.880]   come to Verizon might be a little hurt by the fact that
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.320]   Verizon has just really been harsh on the
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.760]   Santana thing.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.640]   And that really may be Verizon saying, you know, we don't
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.040]   really care.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.920]   We're going to stick with Android.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.160]   We're doing very well with the droids.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.760]   Maybe T-Mobile, that's the latest rumor.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.840]   T-Mobile will be the first.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.720]   It would make sense because T-Mobile is the other GSM
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.480]   carrier in the US.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.880]   It'd be easy thing to do.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.200]   If you look at--
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.720]   Go ahead.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.280]   I just can't think of any compelling reason to say if
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.760]   you have an iPhone on an AT&T network, by all means, go
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.200]   to T-Mobile instead.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.960]   Unless you have specifically have better coverage from T-Mobile
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:34.040]   in your home or in your office area, because the map for AT&T
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.760]   coverage is way, way, way better than the one for T-Mobile.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   Right.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.760]   Yeah, I would have no reason to bounce to T-Mobile.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   I mean, Verizon, I could be tempted.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   Right.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   But AT&T--
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.000]   T-Mobile's worth--
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.080]   T-Mobile or Sprint, any of the other ones, it doesn't make
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:48.720]   any sense.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.240]   It'd be nice to have choice, though.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.200]   I think just on basic principle, I would love to see it
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.240]   on multiple carriers.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.720]   I think that if Verizon had an opportunity to carry the
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.480]   iPhone, the first principle of business is that if someone
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.520]   comes to your office with money in hand and they want to give
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   it to you, take the money.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.160]   Well, they turned it down at the beginning.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.360]   That was the-- it was just too much control.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.440]   Apple wanted too much, so on and so forth.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.400]   They kind of pushed Apple out, according to the--
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.200]   But that was more because that was a total rewrite of how
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.160]   handset manufacturers relate to carriers.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.840]   It's never been, here is-- you're going to be lucky enough
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.040]   to carry our hardware.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.080]   Here are the terms that we're going to dictate to you.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.720]   And that's never been the way that any carrier had ever
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.120]   dealt with any handset manufacturer.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.240]   It's always been, well, Apple, the problem is that we don't
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.120]   see a place where we can put our logo on it.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.640]   You're not going to put your logo on our phone.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.040]   Like, well, why would we do it if we--
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.640]   It was cool.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.120]   I took some pictures of a front upcoming column of two
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.840]   different HTC phones with the iPhone 4.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.080]   And it was just for size comparison.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.760]   But now that I'm looking at it on the big screen in my office,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.560]   it really did strike me that you have the Droid X that has
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.440]   the Verizon logo and this other badge and these other art
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.320]   and graphics on the front for the label, the buttons
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   and this other logo.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.600]   And then you have the HTC Evo phone from Sprint
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.920]   and has the HTC logo and the Sprint logo and other Android
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.440]   logo.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.360]   And then in the middle, you have the iPhone 4.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.640]   The only piece of artwork on that entire front
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.760]   is just a little rounded square to let you know that, oh,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.560]   by the way, this is a home key.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   We're putting something on this just to indicate that it
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   might be important for you to push this at some point.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.280]   Otherwise, we really don't want to contaminate the clean lines
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.800]   with this lovely thing that we've built.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.680]   There's an apple on the back, but it's a pretty apple.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.040]   You don't ever have to even see it if you just don't turn it over.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.080]   This just in, "E-phone 4, antennae la goodo,
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.680]   garlic, some concurrinter."
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.760]   I thought you'd like to know that.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.120]   This is from Norway.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.480]   But I've heard this same thing in other languages.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.040]   From all over the world, basically, the iPhone 4's
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.680]   and antennae problems are US only,
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.080]   that in other countries, most people are saying it's AT&T
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.840]   because we're not having the problem.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.120]   I just--
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.880]   Yeah, it's because of our--
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.480]   I think that's it.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   Well, one of our chatters is in Toronto.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.760]   He says, "I have four iPhone 4's or 5,
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.080]   and they're all fine.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.800]   I don't have dropped calls."
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.360]   Maybe it is AT&T.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.400]   I want to say one more thing, which is, so what
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.320]   if Android sales are bigger than iPhone sales?
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.520]   Apple has never wanted to be the best-selling necessarily.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.720]   They want to be the best.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.600]   And Apple's been content with the Mac,
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.160]   having 5% of the market share.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.720]   Maybe they'd like 10%, but I don't think they ever
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.040]   wanted to be 95%.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.840]   They just want to make the best stuff for a limited market
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.680]   with higher margins.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.920]   And I think that--
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.480]   And Apple users, I think, are the same way.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.400]   I don't think they care if iPhone 4 is outsold by Android.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.280]   Do you actually think that a lot of Apple users are probably
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.360]   like me that we don't want to see it become the dominant piece
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.760]   because it becomes a target for viruses.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.080]   It becomes whatever.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.920]   I think that it's--
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.080]   And we have to remember, BMW is 7% of the market
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.040]   or 4% of the market.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.480]   It's not--
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.640]   Perfectly happily.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.960]   You don't need to be a majority of the market.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   I think it comes under the fact that I'm not
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.040]   a stockholder in Apple, so I absolutely
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.280]   don't care what their market share is.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.920]   So long as the company is selling enough,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.360]   that they're going to be selling them next year
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.640]   and the year after that.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.040]   I think the stockholders are pretty happy to, frankly,
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.720]   that's too satisfying for you.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.280]   Market penetration is not a user feature.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.680]   And Apple has always been about user features.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.160]   Let's take a break.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.520]   We're going to come back with more news from Microsoft.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.360]   Apple's plan for Lala.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.560]   And let's see.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   A little pad news.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.200]   We haven't talked about the iPad in a while.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.520]   We've got some pad stories coming up.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.800]   But before we do, I want to mention our friends at Hover.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.360]   If it's time for you to register a domain,
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.000]   don't go to the other guys.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.360]   And then you know what I'm talking about,
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.000]   the ones that get all the attention.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.840]   The ones with the sexy ads.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   Go to the ones that are going to do you the best job.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.080]   And that's hover.com.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.120]   In fact, if you go to macbreak.hovered.com,
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.440]   you'll see a clean, simple site that just makes it easy
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.520]   to register domain names.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.800]   No upselling at the end.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.280]   Just good prices, great service.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.640]   In fact, they have a new no hold policy for customer service
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.120]   calls during the week.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   9 to 8 p.m. Eastern Monday through Friday,
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.440]   you get somebody right away.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.640]   You've got to love that.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.680]   Look how clean this is.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.920]   Macbreak.hovered.com.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.960]   And you'll see right there domain forwarding
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.400]   with no email $15.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.280]   If you want an email box, $35 a month.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   Domain forwarding $6.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.920]   Email box is $60 a month.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.480]   Can I just recommend that as somebody,
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.040]   if you are still using Gmail or Hotmail or me.com
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.120]   as your address, it might not be a bad idea
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.720]   to continue to use those services for your email,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.040]   but to have your own name or your own domain.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.720]   And that's what you give out.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.880]   The advantage of doing that is if you change email service
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.360]   providers and look at that happens all the time,
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.440]   you don't have to change your address, your domain.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.360]   You just change the forwarding through hover.com.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.000]   H-O-V-E-R, hover.com.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.080]   And if you use the offer code Macbreak, when you sign up,
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.640]   I think you get 10% off your Macbreak,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.880]   10% off your registration.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.840]   Another great reason to look at hover
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.560]   for your next domain registrations.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.840]   We moved all our domains over there.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.680]   I just like them.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.880]   You might have heard of them as domains direct.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.840]   They're run by two cows.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.200]   They've been doing this since 1997.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.640]   And they really know what they're doing.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   Macbreak.hovered.com.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.800]   And we thank them for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.440]   They are Macguys.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.480]   So sometimes you call these guys and you say,
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.360]   I want to configure a Mac and they go, huh?
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.560]   Does that still happen?
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   Happened for a long time.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   You get an ISP and they go, no, sorry, we don't do that.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.960]   Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.400]   Mac, what's that?
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.280]   That's the disadvantage of not being dominant.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.840]   But you don't have to worry about that with the iPhone.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.160]   Everybody knows the iPhone.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.560]   You don't ever have to run into that.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.640]   Also, I think that network services
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.120]   have become a lot less provincial than it was five years ago.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.160]   Right now, right now, right now, the word really
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.880]   is out that if you're a system administrator,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.800]   you're being paid to know about how
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.520]   to get computers working on networks.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.960]   And you don't know how to make a Mac work on a network.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.760]   You're an idiot.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   Right.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.960]   You are.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.840]   It's like, well, as Director of IT Services,
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.400]   your next job is to go on to this thing
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.560]   that we've heard called Craig's List
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   and post this ad for a new person to replace you in three months.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.760]   So a number of new pads coming out finally.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.880]   There's that organ from, was it Kmart, the $150?
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.960]   Have you seen, has anybody seen one of these organs?
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.000]   No, I've seen pads that are kind of in that class.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.560]   And the usual difference between them
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.120]   is video acceleration, where it's just such a sluggish UI.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.840]   Even if it does run Android, like most of them
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.360]   are running like Android 1.6.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   I've seen one that actually runs Android 1.2.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.280]   But for like a $99 tablet or a $150 tablet,
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.480]   maybe you can say, I'm not going to use it to surf the web
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.240]   or run dynamic applications or watch YouTube videos.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.520]   I just want it as a book reader.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.280]   But even so, it's just so slow and just putting bits
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.160]   onto the screen that you're just--
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.520]   you just quickly realize how easy it is to throw it.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   And you've spent so little on it that you might actually
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.120]   be fun to throw it at something big and hard.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.320]   RIM says they're going to do a tablet.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.720]   It's going to be called the Blackpad, which
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.120]   is a terrible name.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.560]   The name is do Blackberry, obviously.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.520]   And if you don't know that.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.480]   And they say a new--
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.600]   American International Pictures.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.000]   American International Pictures presents a Samuel L.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.080]   Bronco and Sperlin.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.800]   Blackpad.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.680]   It's the tablet computer for--
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.880]   slated for November, presumably running Blackberry 6.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.920]   A lot of people are waiting for Android 3 Gingerbread,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   which is really designed for both phones and tablets.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.640]   What an odd choice that was.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.880]   Especially now that we have--
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:05.640]   now that we have a $139 Kindle coming out,
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.320]   I think that the $139 Kindle is going
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.720]   to be as upsetting to other manufacturers
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.160]   as the $499 iPad was back when that was announced a few months
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.120]   ago.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.560]   Because people who thought that, well, there's room for a--
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.880]   for a really, really horrible tablet that costs $150.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.080]   Because people want ebook readers and people
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.720]   want this sort of functionality.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.160]   But if you're telling them, no, here's
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.240]   something that really works great at that same price point,
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.920]   it really just show off how shoddy your original product is.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.420]   OK.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.880]   And I think that Apple is going to be capable of bringing
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.960]   that price down.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.960]   I think that's the issue is that they get that in the past.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.240]   I think they can bring it down-- if they bring it down to $399,
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.160]   they just-- it's like--
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.160]   It's death.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.360]   $399 without the camera.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.640]   Oh!
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   We are seeing, by the way, that in the network tools
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.320]   for people configuring iPads for business,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.200]   there is a way to turn off the camera in the iPad.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   Oops.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   Should have deleted that.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.000]   Wonder where they would put that in.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.560]   Step one, do not drill a hole in the front vessel.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.640]   Step two, do not insert Samuel Part Number ML 441.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:13.600]   Step three, do not solder these three leads into the CPU.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.040]   Microsoft has announced it's pricing for Office 2011 for Mac.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.840]   It will be out in October.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.920]   There is no upgrade.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.440]   This is what they did on Windows, too, which kind of shocks me.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.480]   In a world where you can go to Google Office,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.640]   you can go to Zoho Office.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.080]   There are a lot of open office.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.760]   There are a lot of free choices.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.680]   Microsoft says, if you already own Office Too Bad,
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.080]   no upgrade pricing for you, you'll
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.600]   pay the full freight to go to Office 2011.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.080]   They did drop the price in the Macintosh.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.320]   Office for Mac, for home and student, 2011,
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.680]   will be $119.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:50.440]   Family pack gives you three Macs, three installations, $149.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.520]   That's basically what they were charging for a home and student
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.040]   edition for Office 2008.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   And the business edition is $199 for one machine, $279 for two
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.560]   machines.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.360]   That's a big drop.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.320]   It was $400 for Office 2008.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.720]   So for business, I think that's great.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.880]   I think that--
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.280]   Is it the end of Office for Mac?
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.160]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.360]   Here's all I got to say is if you're working at home,
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.440]   or if you're working as a student, $49.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.480]   $49 for iWork.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.120]   I understand the only reason to buy Office, in my opinion,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.800]   right now, is that Excel, when you're doing heavy, heavy work,
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.040]   heavy lifting, I think Excel is better and faster
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.960]   than numbers.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.240]   Yeah, you know, Lisa, who's our number person, she's our CEO
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.360]   and does all the books, she uses Excel, not on the Mac,
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.240]   on Windows.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.520]   But if you're working as someone who's doing smaller Excel
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.920]   stuff, if you're working--
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.040]   I mean, smaller spreadsheet stuff, presentations, pages.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.160]   Pages is much nicer, in my opinion, than Word.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.560]   I mean, in a lot of ways.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   And so the thing is, unless you really
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.320]   have to integrate with people all the time
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.400]   and using every little feature that Word has,
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   it just doesn't make any sense.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.880]   And I see a lot of people using Google Docs.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.000]   Now that you can edit Google Docs on your iPad and iPhone,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.200]   why not just use that and live in the cloud?
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.760]   It's definitely become a much, much less compelling product
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.280]   than it was even just five years ago,
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.280]   because people using Google Docs, not only that,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.000]   but the market for alternative Word processors,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.760]   like specialty Word processors, has just exploded in ways
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.040]   that I would never have predicted.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.200]   On the Mac, people are not necessarily using Word.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.920]   They're using pages.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.680]   They're using Scrivener.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.800]   They're using any of two or three other apps that
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   are not designed to be Microsoft Word,
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.520]   dodecahedron edition.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.120]   It's just designed to help you just push out 10 to 12 page
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.720]   documents, letters, and things that are forming that
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   are integrate with Google Docs and have a regular script.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   So here's a tip for--
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.160]   It's super flush.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.520]   You can get iWork for $32.30 on Amazon.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.360]   That's a great price.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.160]   It's a great thing is that you--
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.720]   And you get keynote, which is easily the better than PowerPoint.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   I mean, it's just--
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.760]   I was just going to say, yeah.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.840]   With keynote, if I see a whole bunch of presentations coming up
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.240]   and I see everyone lining up their PowerPoint,
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.840]   I'm like, well, I'm going to look good.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.520]   Without much trying.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.480]   I'm going to add a couple of little transitions
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.080]   in my slides of the things flying forward.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.240]   And also, it was like I put together,
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.280]   even though the spreadsheet for doing heavy numbers
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.560]   and heavy spreadsheets isn't necessarily there,
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.680]   I put together a presentation for someone where I put together.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.440]   I added all these things up in numbers,
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.920]   and I linked everything, and I built some active graphs,
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.120]   and so on and so forth.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.560]   And I handed to someone, and they said,
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.200]   well, you didn't need to do all that work.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.720]   This was just a quick little proposal.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.640]   I was like, yeah, I didn't.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.240]   That was just me thinking out loud,
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.680]   and that's what I ended up with.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.720]   It looks like I did an entire design run through it.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.600]   But that's the advantage.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.200]   For us, I guess I just want it more than the other people
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.000]   bidged but bidding for this project.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.400]   Yeah, exactly. That's what I should have said.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.920]   Instantly, thanks to the chatroom,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.680]   Thomas Ricker is writing on Engadget saying,
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.400]   don't get so excited about the camera configuration
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.840]   in the iPad because it's word for word exactly the bullet points
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.760]   that were used on the iPhone.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.880]   They probably just forgot to delete that line.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.680]   I still think we're going to get one.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.800]   You already know we're going to an upfront phasing camera.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.000]   Yeah. Face time.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.680]   Two words.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.520]   Actually, one word to be decapped.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   That's all you have to say.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.800]   The fact of the tooling for that mount is apparently
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.480]   right there in the frame.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.800]   Either that's a lot of forward thinking or they're like,
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.520]   eh, maybe next year, maybe the year after.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520]   But yeah.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.520]   I guess people really do want to see the inside of their noses.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.040]   I have to say, by the way, that while I'm not
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.520]   compelled by FaceTime on an iPhone,
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.160]   I think FaceTime on an iPad might be a very interesting product.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.800]   That might be really the product.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.920]   You think it would ever be so well integrated into AT&T
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.600]   that would work on an iPhone touch?
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.040]   Excuse me, iPod touch and even like a Wi-Fi only iPad.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.120]   Like if it were so well-known, isn't it?
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.240]   You could-- if a dressbook were able to say,
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.320]   I'm aware that I don't have access to 3G,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   but I do have access to Wi-Fi, I'm just
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.520]   going to take a few kilobytes to ask the AT&T network.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.000]   AT&T network, if the person at this phone number
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   happens to be on Wi-Fi right now.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.880]   And if so, I'm going to route this call through Wi-Fi.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.760]   It'll be such a big win for AT&T,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.400]   and that would take some load off their network.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.320]   Have we noticed-- I don't know what the regulation would be,
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.000]   though.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.560]   Well, once you've connected to someone for your FaceTime,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.400]   from then on, it's always just-- it'll automatically go to--
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.560]   if you're hooked to Wi-Fi and they're on Wi-Fi,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.000]   it'll just automatically use the Wi-Fi.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.800]   It doesn't even ask you.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.920]   And the thing that I find very interesting about FaceTime
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.320]   is that all the sound effects are all eye-chat.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.040]   So there are already-- I feel like that's--
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.400]   Apple is moving past cellular.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.640]   The iWork Family Pack is 58 bucks.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.680]   Really, why not on Amazon?
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.800]   And it's really-- that's-- the Family Pack
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.000]   is more of an honor system.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.800]   We buy Family Packs for the office
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   because we want to make sure that we really have everything
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.040]   registered.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.760]   But there's no serial number.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   Right.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.320]   It's just like--
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.440]   You just install it wherever you want.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.840]   There is a serial number, but it works on anything.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.360]   It works on anything.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.400]   A couple of real quick ones.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.800]   We're running late, and I want to get going.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.320]   Apple acquired la-la.com last December's streaming music
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.080]   site.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.600]   And Apple spokesperson-- let's see.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.480]   Apple's telling executives, according to CNET news
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.400]   at the four top labels, that if Apple offers any cloud music
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.760]   features within the next few months,
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.880]   they'll likely be, quote, modest in scope, end quote,
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.360]   and not include the kind of functionality Apple outlined
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.160]   in the meetings with labels earlier.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.480]   Apple still hasn't negotiated the kind of licensing
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.760]   deals it would need.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.080]   Apple is apparently implying that they'll
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.880]   be doing video streaming before they do audio streaming.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.280]   So maybe they bought la-la for the engineers, not the service.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.080]   It's so interesting whenever I see rumors like this
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.720]   or just the potential of a certain service
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.080]   or a certain technology to think that, yes, it's technically
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.760]   possible.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.320]   Yes, it's supported by the OS.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.240]   Yes, everybody at that company wants it to happen.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.640]   But where within-- if there are a pile of agreements
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.040]   this long of what your obligations are to everybody
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.840]   in this chain, what point does it say that, no, you can't stream
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.520]   this because that cons-- that cons is a rebroadcast,
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.000]   and you have to negotiate a new fee for rebroadcast.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.840]   Even though this was like boilerplate stuff that's
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.200]   going back from 20 years, it's still in the contract
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.440]   that you can't necessarily stream this content without paying--
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.280]   without some writer or some producer who
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.120]   wanted to get-- they at least want
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.160]   to be lied to about the reason why they're not getting the one
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.040]   third of one cent that the studio owes them.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:26.560]   Incredible.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.520]   People frustrating, though, to people who were la-la lovers.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.640]   Better get shut down and then--
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.160]   Right.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.040]   There is audio, though.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   I like audio a lot.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:33.320]   I don't know.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.800]   Is audio comparable to la-la?
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.880]   It seems similar.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.520]   You don't-- anyway, I like audio, and that's now
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.200]   open to the public, I believe.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.120]   So RDIO, there's an iPhone app, and I'm pretty sure there's
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.400]   an Android app, and there's desktop.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.600]   And it's similar streaming music solution.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.400]   Not like Pandora where you get what you get,
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.960]   but where you-- more like la-la where you choose what you
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.640]   want to listen to.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   Fine.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   Go ahead, man.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.480]   I don't know.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.560]   I was just going to say, I think the time is well-passed
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.560]   for us to have-- not just to get what you get to service,
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.320]   but get what you own service.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:04.840]   Got it.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.840]   Or we got it.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.520]   They just kind of start catching up and saying,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.840]   if I've already bought this album,
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.720]   why are you locking into me having physical ownership
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.480]   of the media in order to listen to my device?
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.560]   I mean, if there's things that prevent me from buying more
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.040]   music and enjoying more music, and that's it.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.760]   One more, and then I'm going to ask you gentlemen
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.440]   to rush through your picks so we can get to this week in Google.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.160]   We got a late start through the technical reasons.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.480]   I do apologize.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.840]   Apple did remove those competitor phone antenna tests
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.760]   from its antenna page.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760]   After we made so much fun--
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.040]   After we mocked it so much last week, they're gone.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   And I think appropriate.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.160]   You know, the point was made.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.000]   Let's put it that way.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.720]   And anybody who was curious probably saw those videos,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.920]   but they're gone off of the Apple page.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.000]   Quickly, let me mention our friends at Citrix,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.880]   and then it'll be our picks of the week.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.520]   Citrix does that great software you've seen go to meeting,
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.320]   go to my PC, go to assist, go to training.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.680]   They do enterprise sharing.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.720]   They've got the remote access down,
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.480]   and they've got it down on Macs and PCs.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.400]   So it's really nice their cross-platform.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.000]   There are other meeting solutions,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.120]   online meeting solutions, that are Windows only.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.440]   But what good is that if you've got a group of people
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.080]   that has both Windows and Mac, go to meeting
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.120]   is so easy to use on both.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.240]   It'll save you so much time in business travel.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.920]   According to American Express, the average cost
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.640]   of a business trip these days, $1,000.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.840]   For one trip, go to meeting $49 a month
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.480]   for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.720]   I use go to meeting all the time.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   I know you will like it.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.880]   That's why we've arranged a 30-day trial
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.360]   for you absolutely free PC or Mac.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.440]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.960]   There's a great iPad app that's free.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.040]   - I'm surprised at how often,
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.680]   I suddenly realized that I'm not using it.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   - I'm now having three or four meetings a week.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.080]   - You know, on these things.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.400]   - Well, it's so easy, you just start it.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.800]   You can even be on a conference call and say,
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.560]   "Hey, look, I want to show you something and just fire it up."
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.720]   They don't even have to have it installed.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.200]   It takes some seconds to install it on the other end.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.000]   15 people at a time, you can trade,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.080]   control back and forth.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.720]   You do a lot of work internationally all over the world.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.240]   - And we're starting to run classes on the technology.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.080]   - You could.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.600]   - On this and the bigger version.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.560]   - Go to training or go to webinar?
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.160]   - Go to webinar, yeah.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.840]   These guys really know their stuff.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.400]   Let me just encourage you to try it.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.640]   - Absolutely free, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.400]   You'll see what we're talking about.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.960]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.800]   Let's start, we never get to start with Andy
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.440]   'cause he's always doing an audible pick.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   So I'm going to start with you Andy.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.040]   - Okay, mine is something that,
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.640]   I'm not sure if we use it as a pick of the week
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.480]   over the past few weeks.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.080]   There was an update to one of my favorite
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.800]   Apple diagnostic utilities called Applejack.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.560]   It is a really, it's a command line utility.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.480]   You install it and what it does is it puts a set
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.400]   of command line utilities inside the terminal
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.000]   so that if you're having it,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.240]   not just a problem where your Mac is just acting up
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.000]   kind of weirdly, but it just doesn't start up at all.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.520]   Many people are aware of the single user trick.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.000]   If you restart with command, holding down command as,
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.640]   you will basically turn it into a Unix terminal
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.960]   and you can work from there.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.480]   There have always been a bunch of command line utilities
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.440]   that you can use to sort of repair things.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.000]   Some of these utilities are like multi-step things.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.480]   What Applejack does is you just restart with command as,
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.720]   you'll give you a terminal prompt,
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.160]   you just type Applejack.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.240]   And it'll give you like this real cool, like old school,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.840]   sorry for this because again,
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.320]   I don't have access to my, my, my, right now.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.000]   But what it will give you is this really cool,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.840]   just sort of like DOS 3.2 startup window
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.240]   of different things that it can do,
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.720]   including basic tricks that might get your machine
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   working again, including just delete all the cache files,
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.800]   delete all the preference files, do FSK,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.160]   which basically is sort of a disk,
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.080]   you just repair, sorry, utility.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.320]   It's a really, really cool way to,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.200]   if you have this installed on your machine,
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.000]   it's a really good way to give,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.640]   have that extra little bit of protection against disasters.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.440]   It won't, it won't heal every problem.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.280]   It won't resurrect every single computer.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.000]   But if you have these really infuriating freezes
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.120]   and you don't know if it's bad memory,
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.520]   you don't know if it's bad hard disk
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.200]   and you don't know if it's something as simple
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.240]   as a single file, press file that is screwing up
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.320]   your boot up process.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.920]   This will let you, this utility, which is free,
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.120]   will let you easily tear your way through it
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.440]   with just a restart and one command line trick.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.000]   - By the way, despite the fact that you showed that
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.880]   on the iPad, there is not yet an Applejack for iPad.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.520]   - That was smart though.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   That was clever. - It's coming.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.000]   - You did a screenshot on the end,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.040]   then you sent it to your iPad
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.680]   so you could hold it up and show us.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.120]   You're thinking.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.520]   - Exactly, using the old noodle.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.160]   - Oh, it was an old noodle there.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.240]   It's applejack.sourceforge.net.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.720]   It's free.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   - And then you're right, it is.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.160]   You've got, if you have a Mac, you should have Applejack.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.840]   - Yeah, it's just, it's one of those things
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.400]   where you have to do it before,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.280]   you have to install this before you start having trouble.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   But the other thing is that it's not like other tricks
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.040]   where some tricks involve opening command line
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.160]   remote access to your Mac so that later on
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.520]   if you need to sort of terminal in from remotely,
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.440]   it doesn't introduce any new security problems
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.280]   into your machine.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.000]   It's just a set of scripts that greatly simplifies
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.120]   these existing Unix tools
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.080]   and makes it just easier for you to navigate them,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.480]   especially if you're not a Unix head to begin with.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.040]   - Yeah, nice thing to know about Applejack.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.200]   Good recommendation, thank you, Andy.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.640]   And now Mr. Alex Lindsey with his pick of the week.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.320]   - So I had an odd need with my iPhone.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.160]   - Really?
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.680]   I know you would never think that I would know.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.280]   - Here's a man who has needs.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.120]   - So I'm working on a new,
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.200]   we're trying to work on a new opening music for Macbreak,
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.920]   which is now, by the way, in 4K.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.160]   Did you see the 4K version?
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.920]   - I haven't seen it 'cause I can't watch it.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.760]   - It's on YouTube.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.600]   - Yeah, but I mean, I don't have any.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.720]   - You don't watch it on 2K,
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.120]   but it's 4K.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.920]   - How many hardware that I could see the 4K on?
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.280]   - That's 2 more K, Leo.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   - I know, it's double the K.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.120]   - It must be better.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.840]   - It's actually quadro the K, right?
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.120]   - And by the way, with Salsagorian talking about
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.720]   awesome ways of porting your iPad,
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.320]   porting data to your iPad,
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.280]   like publishing to the iPad.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.240]   - So I was gonna be on Mac Mania 11.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.440]   - Yeah, so we, anyway, we're gonna go.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.000]   Anyway, so, but I was watching it and now it's in 4K
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.640]   and we have to upgrade the set.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.240]   And if you just search Macbreak,
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.400]   sound iPad, you'll get it.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.280]   Anyway, so we were, that has nothing to do with it.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.120]   What happened was I was like,
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.880]   "We gotta now move the music in the background."
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.280]   - You're such a nut brain.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.600]   - What, you had to do it?
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.960]   - Let me see now, see, okay, 360.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.280]   - See, look, no, go to original.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.600]   - 4K, 7, 20, 10, 80.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   And there's something-- - The go to original.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.960]   - It goes to 11.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.800]   - It goes to 11.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.000]   - It goes to original.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.840]   - There it is, and there's--
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.360]   - And there's Sal, you could see Sal's beard,
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   every detail, every whisker in glorious.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.200]   And it'll move.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.040]   - And it's very, very such great detail, you know,
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:48.880]   what he had for breakfast.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.960]   - So, oh, by the way-- - So, it's very clear,
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.600]   but it's not moving at a frame rate that I would enjoy.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.440]   - You know what's interesting about that?
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.360]   - Is it your start, that bad?
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360]   - What?
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.480]   - This is a side recommendation is that Chrome
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.760]   is the only thing that I found played it back on the Mac.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.600]   - I'm playing it in Chrome,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.280]   but the problem is it's an older 7, 10.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.120]   - It's an older laptop, yeah.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.960]   - But on my computer, the only one that I could get
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.680]   in full, uh--
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   - By the way, this isn't 4K, because the screen isn't 4K.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.520]   - Right.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.360]   - So you're seeing a scaled down version.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.640]   - Right, and it's doing it on the fly.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.600]   - It's very crisp.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.440]   - Yeah.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.280]   (laughing)
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.120]   - Well, look at that key.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:17.960]   Look at that green screen key.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.800]   - The key is perfect.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.640]   - It's pretty little hair, okay.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.960]   - Look it, I can see, look, you can see the screen screen
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.840]   through Alex's little flip on his forehead.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840]   - Yeah, yeah, see.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.680]   - Yeah, let's go back.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.400]   - I'll say, 'cause I look in New England,
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.480]   like the Roman Catholic Archdiocese has his own cable channel,
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.520]   and it's looking a lot like,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.360]   "Well, that's for grip strength now."
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.320]   - I can zoom in to Alex's--
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.520]   - It's a fly flip.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.360]   - There it is.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.200]   - But look, I can see the good--
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.360]   - But his house got better hair to test this with.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.200]   - All right.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.040]   - See if you'll go over--
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.880]   - But Sal's wearing the hat.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.700]   - I know, but no, look down there,
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:43.540]   and look at all the little--
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.920]   - Look, the key goes right through his hair.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.760]   - Look at that.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   - Ladies and gentlemen, there is perfect--
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]   - The thing of key.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.200]   - You don't even see those keys on broadcast,
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.480]   most of the time, those are just very good.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.360]   - No, in fact, whether men had keys like that,
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.520]   you'd actually believe they were in front of a map.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.360]   - Exactly.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.880]   - So anyway, so we've upgraded that look,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.200]   and we wanted to upgrade the key on Alex's here right now.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.840]   Can you tell, look at that, that red curtain looks so real
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.520]   behind you, I mean, that's perfect to Alex.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.800]   And this is, by the way, we're showing a 4K video
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.240]   on like a half K--
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.080]   - Right, exactly.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.360]   - Flash stream.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.360]   - But when you look at it, it's amazing.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.200]   - No, no, no, it's amazing.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.040]   - Anyway, so--
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.200]   - Let's upgrade it to yourself--
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.480]   - By yourself, a 50 inch monitor, so you can look at this.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.240]   - But even at 27, I actually think we should make it like
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.840]   27, 44, whatever the maximum for the 30, 27 inches.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.760]   But that's probably a good size for us to work in.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.600]   - So--
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.000]   - So we wanted to increase, I want to improve the music,
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.440]   so I started trying to think of some tunes,
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.760]   but the problem is I don't really know how to read music.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.440]   I, like I can hum things that, oh, this would be a good idea,
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.600]   but I don't have any way to create it.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.520]   So I found this app on the,
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.640]   I found this app for the iPhone called Note Detector.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.720]   - Note Detector.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.520]   - Note Detector.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.200]   - By the way, we started using on the iPad
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.120]   for our iPad Today show.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.720]   I'm sorry, I mean, it's fine.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.560]   - No, it's fine.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.960]   - But you have a clapper application.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.800]   - Yeah.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.640]   - It's really great.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.480]   - Doesn't it work?
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.720]   - Yeah, and it syncs up with the iPhone.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.560]   - Yeah.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.400]   - It's awesome.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.240]   Okay, Note Detector.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.640]   - I think I did not recommend that.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.320]   - You did, that's, and we were sitting there
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.200]   actually at the shoot, and we have a three camera shoot
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.640]   thinking, oh, wait a minute, we have it.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.880]   What are we gonna do, clap?
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.720]   - Right.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.000]   - And then Daniel said, oh no, wait a minute,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.560]   what about that thing Alex talked about?
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.840]   I downloaded it, put it on the iPad, and we had it.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.000]   - And there's a great little--
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.360]   - It's actually an iPad hold case that you can put
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.840]   your hand behind it, so you can hold it.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.520]   No, no, it just holds it, so it's just easier to hold it out.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.360]   We found that that was--
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   - It's a really cool application.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.440]   - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.440]   - No, it's fine.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.720]   So it's called Note Detector, and what you can do
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.840]   is hit record and go, bum, or whatever you wanna do.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.080]   You're a bum.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.600]   - Alex, you're a bum.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.680]   And it'll detect it, and that was a, you know,
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.280]   A sharp minus two off key.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.120]   - Is it actually?
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.960]   - It's pretty accurate.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.800]   I started testing it, and everything I've tested with so far
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.640]   has been, that's actually kinda neat.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.480]   - So you could test--
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.960]   - So you could, let me get the vuvuzela.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.280]   - Uh oh, we're gonna--
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.120]   - Any excuse?
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.400]   - What key is the vuvuzela? - Is the vuvuzela?
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   - Is that supposed to be vuvuzela?
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.880]   - I don't know, we'll find out.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.800]   I'm ready.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.120]   - Okay, I'm gonna blow into your phone.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.600]   - Okay, hold on, here we go.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.260]   (phone ringing)
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:19.360]   (laughing)
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.800]   - And he took off his headphones.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.120]   - Oh, I screwed up somehow.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.960]   - Again, somehow it thought that it was still A sharp,
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.720]   but I think it might've been over.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.600]   - I don't think we wanna really do it again.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.440]   I don't think we wanna do it again.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.240]   - Yeah, yeah, we're gonna like--
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.680]   - Testing the note detector.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.960]   - You're not blowing that hard enough.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.840]   - So you can sing it hard enough, says Lisa.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.200]   - So you can sing a little song.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.880]   - I'm not gonna touch it, don't worry.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.960]   I might blow it hard, though.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.800]   - Hold on, hold on.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.640]   - Are you ready?
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.480]   - Hold on.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.400]   - Ready to do.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.800]   - Can you blow it without touching it?
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.640]   Ready?
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.220]   (phone ringing)
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:57.000]   - The problem there is that that was a lot of notes.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.160]   - That was a lot of notes.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.000]   - That was a lot of notes.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.920]   - It was gonna be like, start once I'm in the notes.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.760]   - Hold on.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.600]   - Start it, yeah.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:03.720]   - Ready, take off your headphones.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.880]   Everybody else, stop listening.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.160]   I'm sure Oprah has a wonderful show on today.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.560]   With no vuvuzela.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.400]   - Hold on.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.840]   (phone ringing)
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.000]   I don't have enough wind to keep it going.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.840]   - All right, so note detector.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.600]   It's marvelous, just don't blow a vuvuzela into it.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.200]   - It's fun because if you wanted to take something
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.280]   that you could hum or that you could play,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.320]   part of it's me trying to figure out
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.720]   how to get stuff from the embira into the--
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.560]   - What's in embira?
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.400]   - That's a fun piano, right?
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.240]   - That's a fun piano, right?
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.080]   - A little fun piano that I play.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.600]   - Those are so beautiful.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.440]   - They are.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.280]   - I had this when I was a kid.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.200]   - They're really fun to play, too.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.360]   (humming)
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.320]   (clears throat)
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.840]   - Sing it, detect it, rock it.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.120]   So once you get the note, does it do anything else?
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.320]   - Well, that's all I needed from it.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.040]   - If I haven't tried anything else, I'd have to--
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:49.880]   - I'm looking at that.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.720]   - I'm looking at that.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.720]   - It looks like you could get a tab out of it or something.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.840]   - Yeah, you could get the tab out of it.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.160]   I haven't tried to go that far.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.320]   I was just excited that I could get the notes.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.440]   - Apparently I suck at vuvuzela.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.280]   - Yeah.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.000]   - Or maybe just the vuvuzela sucks.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.040]   - That's exactly what you're supposed to be blowing.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:05.880]   Is that it?
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.640]   - I was sucking.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.560]   There you go.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.600]   - Didn't read the little card that came with it, did you?
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.680]   You just wanted to get right into it.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.400]   - Now, my pick, thank you, Alex, for that pick of the week.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.160]   Is it free?
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.080]   - It is.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.360]   I think it's like $1.99 or $1.99.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   - It doesn't look expensive.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.200]   - It's cheap.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   - It doesn't look expensive.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.040]   - It's expensive.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.880]   I don't think it's free.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.720]   I think it's $1.99 or $2.99.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   - They also have, they're gonna do a beat detector.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:31.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.880]   But I mean, a lot of times you're thinking about
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.160]   cool little notes that you want,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.760]   you know, cool little songs, but you don't know how to do it
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.800]   and this is the way to do it or one of the ways.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.160]   - Vally Nate.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.040]   So Merlin Man should really be here for this.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.840]   By the way, we've asked him and he will come back
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.760]   when he's done with his book,
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.880]   which is in September 'cause we miss Merlin.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.800]   - And there was a polite applause in the background.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.600]   - No, I didn't want to ruin your audio
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.360]   but I have enthusiastic about Merlin coming back.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360]   - We love Merlin.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.320]   Yeah, if there were any doubt, Merlin,
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.400]   if you had any doubt that we love you, we do.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.120]   So come back to watch Merlin, come back.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.000]   But Merlin worked on with the folks at Omni Group,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.280]   a great task manager, a little more powerful
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.400]   than I need called Omni Focus.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.400]   Well, I thought, you know, actually I do need it desperately.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.240]   It's a very easy way to do the getting things done methodology
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.400]   if you're a fan of that project management context,
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.000]   great inbox and for a while they've had,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.120]   now I'll tell you the negative right up front,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.000]   it's expensive and they charge a lot for both the desktop
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.120]   and then you have to buy the iPhone app separately.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.160]   And Lord, Lord, Lord, they've got an iPad app finally,
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.100]   which is $40 in addition to the whatever, 129 you paid
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.780]   for the Omni Focus desktop and the 30 you paid for the iPhone.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.540]   But once you got it all together,
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:49.860]   you've got a killer setup and I have to say
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.260]   that this was kind of the piece of the puzzle
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:55.460]   I was waiting for, the ability to use Omni Focus on an iPad.
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.700]   This is the platform for a to-do list.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.940]   I mean, a very powerful to-do list,
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.700]   easy to create new lists, you know,
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.180]   easy to maintain it.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.220]   And the thing that's very key, I think,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.780]   in a good project or task manager is this review process.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:15.780]   You've, it's gotta be easy to review on a regular basis
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.580]   and to modify on a regular basis.
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.380]   And you really, you wanna review daily.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:25.100]   This, I admit it's hugely expensive.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.500]   It's only for somebody who really is convinced,
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.340]   I would suggest the 30-day free trial of Omni Focus
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:33.740]   on the desktop first before you spend the money
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.620]   on the iPhone and the iPad app.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.460]   - And you really do need to, you know,
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.300]   kind of drink the getting things done, cool-aid.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.460]   - You do, this is not, this is, it's a life,
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:43.300]   it's a commitment.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.980]   Well, and that's where Don McAllister comes in.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:48.220]   He's done some really good tutorials on screencasts online
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:51.580]   that are free on using, paid for by the Omni Group,
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.100]   on using Omni Focus.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.580]   So I'd really suggest looking at those,
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.580]   looking at Merlin's posts.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.900]   Yeah, you almost have to learn,
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.900]   this is a program you have to learn how to use.
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:00.860]   I'm not gonna kid you.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.380]   This is not like, you know, things,
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.780]   which is very straightforward
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.100]   and a great to-do list.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:08.420]   It's not like, remember, the milk or toodle do.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.580]   This is a power tool, but if you are a person who needs
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.060]   as I do a lot of help with a lot of things going on,
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.860]   I think Alex, you might find this useful.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.900]   And again, the review on the iPad is,
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.180]   this is, you wanna be able to swipe things around.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.980]   I mean, it's just the natural way to kind of
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.060]   move things around.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.140]   Data entry on the iPad, a little more difficult.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.700]   So I would probably use the desktop
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.300]   to get all the stuff into your inbox.
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:32.380]   And then I would use, I would do the weeklies and dailies
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:35.540]   on here because this is just a natural way to do it.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.380]   Really feels good.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.500]   And it was one of those things that I was very into
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.380]   to get anything's done for a while,
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   but because it wasn't integrated with everything
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.100]   that I was doing, it couldn't be all present for me.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.140]   And it just fell apart.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:47.820]   So having these all tied together
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.340]   is an incredibly important piece of the book.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.020]   David Allen says you've gotta have,
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.020]   it starts with a trust, and he, by the way,
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.300]   we had a caller on the radio show this week,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.860]   and it said, I use the Franklin Planner,
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.180]   I've been using it for 12 years,
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.340]   it's really effective to me.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   And I said, no, if you've got a system that works,
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:05.860]   even David Allen says, this paper is fine.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:08.340]   It's not, you know, a lot of us geeks spend a lot of time
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.340]   tweaking the system instead of getting things done.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.900]   So I'm not advocating you spend a lot of time
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:15.340]   tweaking around with your system
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.340]   if you've got a system that works.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:19.340]   But if you're looking for a system that works.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.340]   I have no system that works.
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.340]   Yeah, and I need to do why.
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.340]   And I took the Franklin system.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.340]   The system that works is I have very effective people
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.340]   surrounding me all the time.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.340]   That's my system.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.340]   And you notice that I haven't had a producer on these shows,
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.340]   and I'm getting one.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.340]   We're going to hire a producer on these shows,
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:35.340]   and you'll notice how much better they get in the next few weeks.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.340]   Because I'm very disorganized.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.340]   Anyway, I'm excited, though, about OmniFocus.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.340]   I think, you know, you could tell I'm excited because I put it
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.340]   on my start, my dock on the iPad.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.340]   I've already bought it for the iPhone and for the desktop.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.340]   So the $40 was kind of a no-brainer for me in the iPad.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:53.340]   This will sink, by the way, and they have a number,
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.340]   one of the things they've done really well,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.340]   they have a number of ways to synchronize this.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.340]   It works with MobileMe.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.340]   That's what I'm using.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   You can do it via Wi-Fi with your Mac.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.340]   But MobileMe is nice because they don't have to all be online
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:08.340]   at the same time or on the same network, even.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:11.340]   You can use -- they're now launching their own sync server.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.340]   This is in beta.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.340]   That's free.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.340]   You can try that.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.340]   You can do your own web dev solution.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.340]   Once you've got OmniFocus set up on any machine,
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.340]   you can sync the settings around.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.340]   In fact, that's what I'm going to do right now is import the
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:27.340]   settings from my Mac onto the iPad.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.340]   So it'll all be set up.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   And then the tasks sink, everything sinks.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.340]   So it's all in sync with itself.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.340]   You'll see.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.340]   If I get more effective in the next few weeks,
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.340]   you can thank OmniFocus.
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.340]   Suddenly, there'll be six new shows and they'll all be running
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.340]   perfectly.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.340]   I've read -- I mean, I took the Franklin Planner -- the day-long
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.340]   course.
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.340]   I've taken every seminar out there.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   I've taken day-balanced courses.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340]   I've read his books.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.340]   I've interviewed him.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.340]   I've done everything I can.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.340]   I'm still disorganized.
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:00.340]   And I don't frankly hold out much hope.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:03.340]   But for those of you who still do, who haven't reached despair
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:08.340]   in this category, this is -- is that one of the 16 tips for
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.340]   highly effective people?
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.340]   Always anticipate failure.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.340]   Plan for failure.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.340]   Well, visualize the failure in your mind.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:18.340]   Otherwise, how can you hope to achieve it?
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.340]   Exactly.
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   And I do that every morning.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:24.340]   I wake up with cold sweat knowing that whatever I'm doing today
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.340]   will be a massive flop.
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   It's gotten me through my 53 years on this Earth.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   The key is just not surrounding yourself with people exactly
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.340]   like yourself.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:37.340]   Damn, I knew there was something.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.340]   Okay, you're all fired.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.340]   No, I have actually a great step.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.340]   And it's interesting that I got into media.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   And I think it wasn't so much because I love media.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   It's because media has something called producers who are
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.340]   organized.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.340]   And I just needed somebody that knew what they were doing and was
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.340]   organized.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.340]   And it's been a miracle.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.340]   Omni Focus, it is not cheap.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.340]   My recommendation, if you haven't examined it at all, is to
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.340]   download the desktop application.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.340]   It's free for 30 days.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.340]   Try it.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.340]   See if you like the methodology.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:04.340]   See if it makes sense to you.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:07.340]   But knowing that there has been an iPhone app for some time,
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.340]   and now they just came out this week with their iPad app,
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   and to me, this is the perfect form factor for this kind of
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.340]   thing.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.340]   You know, I always have the iPad with me.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.340]   The iPhone was a little too small to read and enter.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:20.340]   You know, it was nice.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.340]   It was more like, well, here's a reminder of what you're doing
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.340]   and it uses the GPS and stuff like that.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.340]   But the iPad, this is like, this is like your to-do list.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.340]   This is like your Franklin Planner, right?
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:30.340]   Here's a way to do it.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.340]   Omni Focus from the Omni Group.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:35.340]   That's my pick of the week we have wrapped it up.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.340]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.340]   That's the sound of wrapping it up.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:44.340]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core, that great group of
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.340]   media artists at pixelcore.com.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.340]   If you go to pixelcore.tv, you'll find his podcast,
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.340]   including the amazing 4K Mac break.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.340]   That's only on YouTube.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.340]   It's the only place we could put it.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.340]   Because they do 4K.
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.340]   They do 4K now.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.340]   And we have the first podcast ever done in 4K,
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:02.340]   and we think the longest 4K sample on YouTube,
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.340]   because most of them are like 30 seconds, like,
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.340]   "Ooh, look, we turned the camera on."
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.340]   So this is like the big push.
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.340]   We got it down to, with the hand help of Andy Beach,
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.340]   who's like the master of compression.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.340]   The 4K one that we uploaded was actually 300 and--
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.340]   - Well, that's not a name, Meg.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.340]   - For how long?
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.340]   - 10 minutes.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.340]   - Okay.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.340]   - That's not bad, actually.
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.340]   - For 4K video?
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.340]   - It's not bad at all.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.340]   - It was pretty good.
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:26.340]   - That's a H.264.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.340]   - It's H.264, but it was an X.264 compressor.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.340]   It's an open source kind of--
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:32.340]   - Interesting.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.340]   - Crazy thing that we use.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.340]   - Well, Mac break some years ago was the very first podcast,
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   I think, to ever do 1080p.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.340]   You were using those amazing Cine Altas.
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.340]   - Exactly.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.340]   - So now you've broken to the next level.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:43.340]   - We have to shot him with the Reds.
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.340]   - Yeah, we shot it with the--
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.340]   - Do you own a Red?
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.340]   - No, Kelly owns a Red.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:49.340]   So Kelly, when he was in town putting together your lighting setup,
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.340]   I was like, "Oh, I've got a Red in town.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.340]   Let's go play."
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.340]   And so we did.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.340]   - YouTube.com/--
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:57.340]   - YouTube slide.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.340]   I don't know what it's--
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.340]   It's one of their, whatever.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.340]   But it just searched for--
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.340]   - You know, it's the three UISJs--
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.340]   - You don't have a count?
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.340]   - We have some.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.340]   - No, no, but you must be on your--
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:10.340]   - It's Mac break SF.
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.340]   - That's all I wanted.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.340]   - That's all I was asking for.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.340]   - I'm sorry.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:19.340]   - YouTube.com/MacbreakSF, and it's a very-- right now, anyway.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:22.340]   - And on top of it being in 4K, it is incredible content about
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.340]   creating content for the iPad.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:27.340]   We've got three of them coming out from Sal that were done there
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.340]   and just how to move stuff via HTML5 and everything else
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.340]   and publish to the iPad.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.340]   So it's cool stuff.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:39.340]   - Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun Times, and we love him,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   even though he hates Skype.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.340]   - Skype is good after you--
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.340]   - I have to--
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.340]   - Why?
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.340]   - I just want it to be--
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   I don't hate you.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.340]   I'm just disappointed in your Skype.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.340]   - Ooh!
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.340]   - Ooh!
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.340]   - Ooh!
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.340]   When I want to really--
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.340]   - Exactly.
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.340]   - When I really zing my kids, that's what I say.
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:55.340]   I still love you.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.340]   I'm just disappointed.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:00.340]   - As a parent, you keep that one like in that little glass panel
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.340]   that you have to smash with a hammer to press that button.
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:03.340]   - Yeah.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.340]   It's only when you know that it's going down.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:07.340]   - It's only when needed.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.340]   - Love you, Andy.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:10.340]   It's great to have you, as always.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.340]   We'll have done on next week, ScreenCastsOnline.com.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.340]   And I'm going to put in a little plug for, because I think it's
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:20.340]   getting rapidly getting to the last chance to take advantage of this.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.340]   InsightCruises.com.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.340]   Andy and I have both done Insight Cruises in the past.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.340]   Those great Mac Mania cruises.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.340]   There's Bob.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:31.340]   But Mac Mania 11 is coming up, and the reason it's on my mind,
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:34.340]   I just signed up for the Antarctica and Machu Picchu trips.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:36.340]   We are going to Patagonia, baby.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:37.340]   I thought it was a brand name.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.340]   No, it's actually South America.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.340]   - Where the jackets are made.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   - Where the Dread Pirate Roberts has a vacation home.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.340]   - Dread Pirate Roberts.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.340]   - Slives in Patagonia.
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:50.340]   We start in Buenos Aires next year, February 4, 2011.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.340]   We sail on the beautiful MS Veen Dom, which is a smaller boat.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:58.340]   And that's a good thing, because we'll be crossing Cape Horn,
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:06.340]   the notorious Sea path around the tip of South America where 50,000
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.340]   vessels have been lost.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.340]   We don't want to be 50,000.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.340]   - We want to die with you, Mac fans.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:13.340]   Come join the old report.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:16.340]   Southsagoya and most of your Mac luminaries.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:18.340]   - As we go down for the last time.
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.340]   - Old times.
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.340]   - Towards Oblivion.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.340]   - We're going to Uruguay, where I could celebrate their triumph at the World Cup.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:27.340]   Port Stanley and the Falkland Islands, where I could celebrate their triumph
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.340]   over Great Britain.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.340]   Oh no, I'm sorry.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.340]   Who do they beat?
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   Argentina?
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:32.340]   - I don't know.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.340]   - Argentina lost to Great Britain.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.340]   - I can never remember that war.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.340]   - There was no one.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.340]   - No one?
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.340]   Okay.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.340]   We still call them the Falkland Islands, not the Malvinas or whatever it was.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.340]   They wanted to call it.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:51.340]   Then we go to Ushaya, Argentina, where we'll see the Francia and Natalia glaciers.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:56.340]   And we'll go through the Beagle Channel, the famous Beagle Channel where Charles Darwin
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:57.340]   sailed.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.940]   Then Punta Arenas Chile, that's on the Strait of Magellan.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.340]   That's where, by the way, you will have a chance to disembark for a day in Antarctica.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:06.340]   I'd say, "Now I have to warn you, it's an expensive day."
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.340]   And I've been talking about this.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.340]   But you know what?
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.660]   How many times am I going to get to Antarctica?
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.660]   This is it.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.660]   - Take a 5D.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.660]   - I'm spending this.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:14.660]   Oh, you think some good glass?
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.660]   - They warned.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.700]   It's very cold.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.340]   - And they warned about freezing up the camera and stuff.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:24.820]   - It really does feel as though you have to like any chance you might have at a travel
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.820]   meme you're going to do for the rest of your life.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.580]   Like if it's going to be, "I'm going to do a little dance everywhere I travel or I'm
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.620]   going to have my little stuffed bowl."
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:35.740]   You kind of plan that ahead because if you want to start any of that, once you get Antarctica,
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:36.740]   - That's it.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:37.740]   - The rest is just cake.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.740]   - Right.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.740]   - You got the hardest one off the map.
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.900]   - I wish I'd had the little dancing bowl on all those other continents because this is
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.500]   going to be my seventh continent.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.100]   That's the main reason why I have to spend three months on this.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.100]   - Oh, exactly.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.100]   - It's my seventh continent.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.100]   - That's it.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.900]   - I'm all quite jealous that is pretty cool.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:52.900]   - Your life is cool.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   - I'm so excited.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.900]   - Yeah.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:31:03.180]   - And then we go on to Chile, Puerto Mont, and finally Santiago, Valparaiso, Chile, where
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.180]   we disembark.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.580]   I'm going to do the three-day excursion after that to Macho Picchu, another place I've
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   always wanted to go, the Great Inca ruins there.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.060]   You're invited to participate in all of that.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.460]   But do if you want to, now look, this is a 12-day cruise.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.140]   This is not a buck 50.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.540]   I'm going to warn you.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.580]   I don't want you to have some sticker shock when you get there.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:25.620]   There are cheaper ways to learn how to use Photoshop, but not for entertaining.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.660]   - I have to admit that.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:33.340]   I cannot promise you the most affordable Photoshop cruise ever, however, there are great people
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.340]   going on this cruise.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.340]   As you mentioned, I'll be on there.
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.060]   Sal Saguayan will be on there.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:38.700]   We just love Sal.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.500]   Don McAllister is also going on it.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.140]   It is going to be a blast.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.060]   I've crashed the page again.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.100]   Macamania11insightcruises.com.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.740]   If you go there, you will see I cannot move.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.020]   I'm stuck on this page.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.020]   If you go there, you will see not only the itinerary, but also the speakers.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.020]   My speeches, I think are going to change a little bit because I proposed that before
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:01.020]   the iPad came out.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.940]   I think I want to do some iPad stuff.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:10.460]   I might even, if I really get ambitious, I might even have a day-long seminar right
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.500]   in an iPad app.
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.500]   Would that be kind of interesting?
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.500]   - That'd be great.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.500]   - Ambitious?
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.420]   HTML5 were actually with Xcode.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:22.420]   I would think Xcode, but I could-- HTML5 would be a lot easier and you don't have to have
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.420]   a developer.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.580]   - I'm going to talk to Sal because he's already-- he's a man.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:26.580]   He is master.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:27.580]   - Well, he's done the HTML5 thing.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:30.460]   Actually, what-- yeah, no, he can't because he's automated that.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:33.260]   So I think I have to do the Xcode thing.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:37.180]   And Sal's just going to sit in the back going, "By the way, Patilicious, Patilicious is his
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.180]   site on how to--"
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:39.180]   - Yeah.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.180]   - "-- on how to--" - "-- love it."
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:44.020]   - And it is-- I mean, he's got that-- I mean, you just have to see it because it's-- I didn't
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   realize how much of an--
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:51.260]   - He did Automator.org, I think, and now he's doing Patilicious.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.260]   It's just really incredible.
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260]   - Yeah, and Patilicious is just-- it's really how to-- it's all the stuff we were covering
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:57.340]   up for the show, but it's really, you know, how to automate getting a pile of images into
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:02.700]   your iPad as an HTML5 or a PDF or, you know, or into an ebook format.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   And--
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   - He says, "Don't bother writing an app.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]   You know, why not just do it in HTML5?"
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   - For this basic stuff, absolutely.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.700]   - Yeah.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.700]   And Patilicious kind of does it for you.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:09.700]   - Yeah.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.540]   - I mean, it could be easier, you know?
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:13.700]   So yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:16.900]   So yeah, I guess I'll let Sal do that one.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.140]   Now I'm not gonna do Xcode.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.660]   That's nuts.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.660]   That's just nuts.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:23.220]   And oh yeah, we should plant a twit flag on Antarctica.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.220]   - Yes.
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.220]   That's what you have to start doing.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.220]   - Are you allowed to do that?
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.220]   - Well, take a picture.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.220]   - I guess if you take it with you after we're gonna take it.
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.220]   - Take a picture.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:35.260]   Okay, also, it'll be more dramatic if you don't have like the 80 or 90 other tourists
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.220]   behind you like taking goofy pictures.
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.220]   You wanna clear the background.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.380]   - Oh, good thinking.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.180]   And maybe have some dogs, some sled dogs.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180]   - Exactly.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.180]   - And then you're gonna get like frost.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.980]   Frosting like a piece of glass in front of the lens.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.700]   You like pre-elect dotted with like flecks of ice and like snow so that when the time
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:57.420]   comes they don't know that it's actually like actually quite balmy for Antarctica and
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:59.180]   you're actually off just off camera.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.980]   There's a cooler Bud lights and bevoses.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.580]   - So hot, I'm dying in this suit.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.060]   Hey guys, great show.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:07.060]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.060]   We thank you all for watching.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:13.100]   We do the show, technical difficulties barring, barred, which never have been yet.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:15.540]   But we try to start at 11 a.m. Pacific 10.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.540]   That's 2 p.m.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.140]   Eastern 1800 UTC every Tuesday at live.twit.tv.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:23.500]   You know what you get if you don't, if you tune in then you get the pre-show.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.500]   - Yes.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500]   - Sometimes 45 minutes of pre-show.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.460]   - And oftentimes some of the kind of parts of the show.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:34.420]   - And you hear language you wouldn't hear anywhere but in anunnery.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   And that is right here live.twit.tv, the chatroom irc.twit.tv.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:39.820]   We tweet it and buzz it and everything.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:45.380]   In fact, if you follow Twit or Twit Live on Twitter, you'll get that information or follow
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:46.460]   me, Leo Laport on Twitter.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.100]   You'll know when we're starting the show.
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.100]   What else can I say?
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.660]   Oh yeah, you can also download video and audio versions.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:55.500]   And somebody asked me the other day, "You're not going to stop doing audio, are you?
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.020]   Never, never."
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:00.940]   Even in the shows that are pretty visual like iPad today, which doesn't really make any
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:01.940]   sense in audio.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:07.780]   You just hear a lot of, "Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, look at that, wow!"
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:11.420]   But you can if you want, you can get that on your too.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.180]   Have I mentioned that we're doing a show on the iPad?
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.180]   - How's that going?
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180]   - It's great.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.820]   We've done four episodes so far.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.060]   Sarah Lane and I will be on vacation so Tom Merritt's going to take over next week here
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.060]   as well as iPad today.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:24.700]   But yeah, it's a lot of fun if you're into iPads.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.380]   We do apps, we do a little how-to, we do interviews, we do news.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.660]   It's the whole kit and the caboodle and we do it in a quick facitpaste of a show.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.860]   It's only about 40 minutes long.
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.580]   Okay, that's it.
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.580]   Back to work now.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.580]   Great time.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:38.580]   That's all.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.580]   [music]
