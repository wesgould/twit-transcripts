[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show in which we conduct a regular weekly forum.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.400]   Discussing the latest Macintosh and Apple news and joining us, what we have a good panel today.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.200]   By the way, thank you to Andy and Arco for filling in for me from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.160]   Andy and his Balalika appear regularly on this show.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.000]   Good to see you again.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.240]   It was definitely illuminating how much work I have to do in order to do what you just do off-handedly every week.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.040]   No, well, yeah, and there's a difference in the result, isn't there, Andy? You're much better.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   So, don't knock it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.960]   And by the way, you were much missed on the Mac Mania crews.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.920]   Everybody said, "Where is it not, Co?" We wanted Andy.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.880]   So...
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760]   We're looking forward to slapping him in person now.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   We just have to tell you to slap him, Leo.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.800]   We reminisced about the time we had the talent show and Andy played the ukulele.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   The first time I ever saw Andy play the ukulele.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.640]   Anyway, thank you.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.560]   And thanks, Sarah Lane, for filling in as well.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   She filled in for a couple of Mac Break weeklies.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.040]   In fact, the old team is back because Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.880]   I'm here with us from his travels.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.360]   Yes.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   Yeah, wherever you went, there wasn't as much sign as where I went, apparently.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.840]   No.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   Or you just spent the whole time inside.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.120]   I spent a lot of time inside.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   I was in Tel Aviv before the bombs.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.560]   Oh, how fun.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   And then I was in New York and then Montreal and LA and then here.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.040]   Man, it's bouncing around.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.200]   Man, you gotta give me some advice for long-distance airplane flights
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.600]   because you must be the expert now.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.520]   You know, Bill Gates used to do.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   He'd arrive at the last possible minute, right when they're closing the door
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.840]   because he didn't want us to waste a single moment sitting in the airport.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.160]   Then he'd run to his seat, cover himself up with that crappy blue blanket.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.120]   What do they make that out of?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   It looks like old plastic bags.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.200]   And then you put it over your head and then we just--
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.320]   like that, the rest of flight.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.200]   I don't--
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.760]   I actually-- well, so my whole thing is all around my sleep schedule.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   So number one is I pretty much get to the airport early
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.720]   so that I can just go into one of the lounges and just work.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.560]   And so I just work until the last minute.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.120]   But once I get to the plane, you know, for me,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.040]   it's just a matter of making sure that I know when I'm going to land
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.320]   and staying up until 10 o'clock at night, no matter when I land.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.880]   You know, so if you land-- you know, because the big problem you get into is you land--
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.560]   It's a jet lag.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.400]   At one o'clock in the afternoon and you go to sleep.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.440]   No, never.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   You will be off for a week.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.960]   I agree with that.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.480]   It's like what I try to do is take a walk in the sunshine.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.240]   Yeah, just do-- you want us to let my brain--
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.360]   the synapse is no, it's still daytime.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.960]   Yes.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   And you walk around, you walk around, you walk around.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.560]   But you're kind of a zombie.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.080]   I think that's where the zombie legend comes from.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.680]   Yeah, I engage in a lot of caffeine.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.920]   I basically regulate my sleep schedule.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   My travel sleep schedule is mostly regulated with coffee and whiskey.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.480]   Coffee says the day has begun, whiskey says the day is over.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   That's good.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.280]   That's a great idea.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   Judy Garland had much the same system on her.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.680]   And listeners, she lived to be 47 years old.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.080]   So there.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   So there, it's a longevity for me.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.640]   Also with us Renee Ritchie from iMore.com and Montreal.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.160]   I guess you missed each other in Montreal.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.640]   That's too bad.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.760]   Hi, Renee.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.200]   Hi, Leo.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.880]   Welcome back.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   Good to see you.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.880]   Thank you.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.360]   I'm looking on a jealousy at your iPad.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.120]   Many minds still has not yet even shown.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.400]   Well, don't be jealous because this is the Wi-Fi one.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.960]   So I got it day one.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.200]   So I'm going to talk a little bit about it
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.760]   because it was the only iPad I took on the cruise.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.040]   But also, let's say hello to the--
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.880]   the manuensis of the very nice website--
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   at very nice website.net--
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.320]   Mr. John Moltz.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.320]   Good to see you.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.400]   Manuensis?
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   I'm a manuensis.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   A manuensis.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.360]   I'm going to-- I'm going to--
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.960]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   It is a person employed to write or type
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   what another dictates or to copy what is written by another.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.600]   So actually, that's a terrible thing to say.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.360]   Leo wins a letter press.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.680]   I apologize.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   Well, I assume you didn't mean it that way.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.360]   I didn't mean it that way.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   It's a secretary.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   I'm a secretary.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   I missed you so much over the past.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.960]   Nobody used the word "ammanuensis" in the last three weeks.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360]   I believe I'm the first.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.840]   I've never used that in my entire life.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.800]   Not senior wensus, although that would be a good name as well.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.360]   Anyway, it's great to have you, John.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.560]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   It's great to be here.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.600]   And everything's going well.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.120]   When we talk, you had recently started the very nice website.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.360]   Yeah, it's--
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   And I'm still doing it.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   You know--
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.200]   It's stopped me yet.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   It's bold in this day and age for somebody to say,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.800]   I'm going to be a blogger.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.560]   Bold and stupid.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.520]   That's me.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.960]   But if there's one area where I think blogging is very, very
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.440]   successful, it's covering Mac stuff.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.920]   I mean, you look at the--
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.320]   some of the best bloggers out there,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.840]   I'm thinking of MG Seagler, John Gruber, Marco Arment,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.040]   Mac bloggers.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   That's really the-- you can really dig into the Mac world
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.160]   that way.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.840]   It's because we keep on paying attention.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.720]   But John, you're writing about more than that.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.440]   You write a little bit about the surface.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.120]   I can't stop myself.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.680]   I keep thinking I should, but I can't stop myself.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.040]   There's a lot to--
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   all right, so I have to come on first
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.560]   before we begin and apologize.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.640]   Because when I left, I had just gotten
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.200]   both the surface of the RT, the Microsoft tablet running
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.560]   Windows 8 or Windows RT.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.640]   They don't even call it 8.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.200]   And they iPad Mini.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.800]   And I did a foolish, foolish thing
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.440]   that I wish to attract.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.040]   I recommended the surface.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.480]   And I didn't recommend the Mini.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.040]   Now, let me in-- in my defense explain before I take it back.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   The thing I don't like about the Mini
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.040]   I continue to not like is that it doesn't have a retina display.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.360]   But I took it with me.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.600]   And the form factor is perfect for travel.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.960]   Yes.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.400]   The size is just great.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.320]   Every time I turn it on and use it, I go, oh, no retina.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.960]   But you get over that.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   Games are fine.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.400]   It's just-- when you're reading text,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.000]   it's kind of something.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.680]   There's something.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.760]   And iPhone apps really look pretty crappy on it.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.160]   But the size is so nice.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.000]   So I have to admit, I must have bad eyesight.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.560]   Because the retina doesn't really bother me at all.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.280]   I mean, the fact that it doesn't have retina doesn't bother me.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   Doesn't bother you.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.640]   Well, what I do find is it's very--
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.760]   I'm very resistant now to taking my other iPad.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.600]   My--
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.480]   I haven't picked it up since I got this.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.640]   It's like, oh, it's a truck.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.200]   It's a truck.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.960]   I mean, it just feels like--
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.040]   You don't see-- OK, here's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.280]   You don't see that the text just looks really grungy there?
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.640]   I guess I just have so many--
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.840]   it doesn't really bother me.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   I mean, I read it just as you said.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.640]   Oh, that bothers me.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   You can't--
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.200]   Especially the small text.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.560]   You're not going to see this at home.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.080]   But if you were to come to the brick house and read this,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.760]   I think you would--
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.640]   I mean, for the most part--
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.480]   It's no part zooming in, Chad.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.880]   It's not going to--
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   Keep going.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   Keep zooming.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.400]   There you go.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.120]   You see how bad that looks?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.920]   Why, you can hardly read it.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.520]   But that's because we're zoomed in.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   And I have to admit that I'm pretty active about zooming things up
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   and moving things around.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.480]   But most of my time is spent on Flipboard,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.960]   if I'm reading something.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   And I mean--
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.520]   Pictures look fine.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:40.960]   It's fine.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.320]   Games look great.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.400]   Videos great.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.800]   Videos fine.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.120]   But it's 1024 by 7.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.360]   It's really-- in all respects, in an on-tech,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.800]   just published their review, they took some time, unlike me.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.720]   And they pointed out that it's essentially in processors
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.600]   everything.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.480]   It's an iPad 2.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   iPad 2.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.640]   Swunked down.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.480]   And that's what we thought it was going to be.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.840]   And I have to say that the form factor just works so well.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.480]   I mean, you know--
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.840]   It's just the right size.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.440]   When Steve said--
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   Steve was wrong.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.640]   Steve was wrong.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.880]   This is a great size.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.200]   Now admittedly, some people are going to want a bigger one
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.400]   for other reasons and for certainly for retina.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.000]   And the reason I disrecommended it was mostly a fit of peak
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   because I feel that Apple could have put a retina in this.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.560]   I think Apple kind of got a little bit--
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.200]   and you're going to correct me, Andy, I'm sure.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   But Apple got a little bit hypnotized
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.680]   by the idea of getting it down to a lower price.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.440]   And had they really just said, look,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.240]   this is the smaller iPad, not a cheaper iPad,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.760]   because people don't buy iPads for price.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.600]   I mean, 3.29 still is a lot more than $200.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.680]   And in Nexus 7, which is higher resolution,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.560]   is $200, comparable Wi-Fi.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.080]   But I think there's more than just the--
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.440]   I think there's more than the Retinos play.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.240]   There's the CPU hit.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.200]   There is the-- or the GPU hit.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.280]   No, but could you make this at $4.99?
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.080]   And the battery.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.480]   And the battery.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah, but I think that, man, they
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.160]   would have been ugly if they had come out with a--
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.560]   All right, 450, right?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.760]   My understanding is that it was impossible,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.480]   based on physics and economics, to actually make a retina
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.120]   iPad mini.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.280]   If you look at the Pixel count, not the density,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.720]   the Pixel count on that display is already bigger
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.440]   than an iPhone 5.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.480]   So if you have to put the LEDs to light it,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.840]   and the battery to power it, you end up getting something
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.080]   that's as thick as an iPad 4, and almost as big.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.840]   There's just no way to get a super density panel
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.720]   in that small form factor yet.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.160]   And there are already-- I already
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.360]   think that Apple's skating on thin ice at $3.29.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.000]   As it is, they've created a device that's really, really good,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.400]   but it honestly isn't also ran next to the other two.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.960]   When it's--
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.560]   Other two--
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.880]   Other two iPads?
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.080]   Well, no, I'm saying, right now, the 7-inch tablets
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.840]   is a three-horse race between the iPad
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.920]   2, the Kindle Fire HD, and the Nexus 7.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.280]   And each of them has a unique advantage
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.800]   that the other two cannot replicate.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   The Nexus 7 is just a better value, better screen.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.280]   It has GPS, even with a $199 model.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.320]   The Kindle HD, as I keep saying, it's a really good
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.400]   for people who just want a content device.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.200]   It's much easier to use than the other two
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.720]   for-- if that's what you're buying for.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.680]   And then with the iPad Mini, only an iPad is an iPad.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.760]   You really don't have to make it more complicated than that.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   If you want that class of software,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.920]   you really do need an iPad.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.560]   Nothing else is going to do.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.320]   But so much it does come down to $329.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.280]   But the thing that really surprised me--
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.240]   this is something I would never have anticipated--
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.320]   is that you guys are, by far, not by long stretch,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.160]   the first people who've told me that they rarely
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.480]   take their full-size iPad out of the house anymore
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.160]   now that they have the iPad Mini.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.520]   And I think there's a piece that's--
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.320]   I think it's going to be running in the sun times on Thursday
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.040]   that is partially a roundup of a more detailed explanation
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.920]   of if you're thinking about buying a 7-inch tablet
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.960]   for Christmas here, the difference between the three.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   But part of it is discussing that maybe 7 to 8 inches
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.320]   is actually the sweet spot for tablet size
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.280]   and that the 10-inch iPad is just--
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   it got so popular because it was the first one that
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.680]   was out there and the first one to hit the market.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.600]   Because when I show people--
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.200]   I kind of have to get used to when I go to family holiday
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.400]   events, whenever I think, should I bring the Windows phone?
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.720]   Should I bring the Android phone?
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Yes, because people are going to ask you about what they
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.920]   thought about the phone they saw advertised.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.320]   And they really are gravitating naturally
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.640]   toward the 7 or 8-inch tablet and away from the 10-inch.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   They have to have a reason to have a larger tablet
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.680]   where as a 7-inch device, something that's more akin
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.000]   to a Kindle, something that's more pocketable and more
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.600]   movable is really what they had in mind all along.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.680]   So I can't wait to see--
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.600]   Apple will never, ever, ever have any problems moving iPads.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.480]   But I'm curious to see what the next sales figures are
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.360]   going to be like for the 10-inch iPad.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.880]   How much this is going to cut into things?
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.680]   Well, I think that's why it's not a retina.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.920]   You could talk-- maybe there are good technical reasons.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.960]   I think it really--
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.880]   Renee was absolutely right.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.400]   It really is all these technical things
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.080]   where to make it into a retina-grade display,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.240]   it would have to cost so much more money.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.160]   It would have to take so much more battery power.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.800]   It would generate so much more heat.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.480]   Except that they're going to do it next year.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.040]   They're going to--
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.560]   Maybe.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.640]   They're going to guarantee you.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.960]   Well, they're going to maybe do it next year.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.040]   I think that as soon as the iPad 2 gets discontinued,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   and we all know that that's going to happen any time now,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.960]   that kind of opens up the $399 price point.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.480]   And we'll see whether Apple decides
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.920]   that they want to make the super-deluxe mini iPad.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.720]   I guess--
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.000]   Whether they want to continue this thing where
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.520]   last year's iPad becomes the inexpensive model this year's
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.880]   iPad is always $499.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.320]   I guess that's my point, is that Apple
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.280]   should have ignored the bottom end of the market and just said,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.880]   look, we're going to make a smaller iPad.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.800]   It's going to cost the same.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.720]   Some people will prefer it.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.080]   In fact, I would have happily paid $499 for this.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.040]   It's a great size.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.400]   It's my new iPad.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.320]   It's what I carry around.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.800]   And I just--
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.640]   It's still a hell of a lot of money for so many people.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.560]   It's a hell of a lot of money.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.920]   And they have a $ automate inch screen.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.760]   They really wanted to make sure that it was thin,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   because otherwise it ends up being too big and too long.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.960]   So in order to do that, they had to make a screen not retina,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   because if you're going to put the battery to power
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   the retina device, like Renee said,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.920]   into that machine, it's going to--
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.400]   That form factor is going to end up being too thick.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.680]   And I have to say that--
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.120]   It's a larger machine.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.760]   I do think that the mini--
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.560]   My anecdotal, I haven't tested it in the lab,
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   it seems like the battery is lasting a lot longer
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.440]   on the mini than it did.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.120]   It does on my iPad.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   Some are saying 12 hours.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.680]   Yeah, and I'm constantly surprised,
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.800]   because I've been constantly surprised
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.560]   by my iPhone and my iPad 3 of and how short they--
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.080]   I guess if you're going to make a compromise,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   they made the right compromise.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.880]   No, I don't know.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.240]   I wish that Apple would get rid of their fetish
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.040]   that everything must be as thin as humanly possible.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.880]   Because this is not--
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.000]   This is not terribly--
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I wish that they would focus on what
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   does a consumer get by making this device thinner?
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.560]   And making something thinner works up to a point,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.680]   at which point nobody cares that the iPad mini is this much
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.800]   thinner, like a tiny amount thinner than the Fire HD.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.280]   I think to the average consumer,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.720]   it's nice that it feels so thin,
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.600]   but it doesn't actually give them anything for that.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.560]   So that's the one thing that whenever someone says,
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.840]   here's why Apple did something.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.640]   And the answer is because they wanted to make it thinner.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.720]   At that point, just something in my brain
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.000]   says, stop, let's discuss why that was even relevant
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.280]   to the design of this.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.200]   Well, in any event--
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.840]   I think because it's a larger screen.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.840]   I think because it's a slightly wider, taller device,
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.240]   that it needed to be a little bit thinner.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.640]   In any event, I take back my remarks,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.040]   because in fact, I used it nonstop.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.640]   I used it more than my retina MacBook.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.400]   I used it more than my other devices
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.160]   that I brought with the including the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.120]   It was exactly the right size.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.440]   And I did do a lot of reading on it.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   Just every time I fired it up, I was like, oh, I wish it were
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.480]   right now.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.040]   It scratches your eyes a little bit.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.200]   Somebody said that.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.600]   I can't remember if some blogger said that.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.320]   And I think that's exactly it.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.000]   And having then tried to use the Surface RT for any length
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.640]   of time, I realized it was a piece of crap that is.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.120]   Apparently, I'm not--
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.800]   I'm the only one who thought it was good.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480]   I felt it was innovative.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.440]   And I really like the Metro style tile interface.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.640]   But it's just not-- in fact, the folks--
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.880]   every Thanksgiving they do this, who is it?
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.400]   It's the analysts who go into Apple stores, everything's
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.960]   giving, and they--
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.760]   Gene Munster?
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.840]   Yeah, Gene Munster.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.320]   And they record like a day's worth of sales.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.360]   And they did it for both the Apple store and the Microsoft
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:38.720]   store.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.520]   And they came up with a very interesting result.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.920]   11 iPads an hour sold at the Apple store.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   Zero Surface tablets.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.200]   Yeah, it's a pretty limited survey.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   Admittedly, it's not a scientific survey.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.680]   No, it's not really not at all.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.560]   I mean, they did eight hours at the Apple store, I think,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.520]   and then two hours of Microsoft.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.720]   All right.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.120]   That's not what you're saying.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.520]   But it's not terribly surprising, either.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.040]   Yeah, I think that was exactly my reaction.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.480]   Let's see.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.800]   So the single hottest tablet on the market
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.000]   for the past three years outsold the one that was just released
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.600]   two months ago.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.080]   Not as you get the planet's feet.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:16.840]   But that--
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   It does also-- to be fair, it does speak
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.040]   to the clarity of the iPad.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.160]   I think that this isn't a window show,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.080]   so I won't get off on a long tangent about this.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.720]   But I still think the Surface RT is a really interesting product.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   Exactly.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.120]   Ever since I saw the Samsung ATIV, which is only a little bit
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.640]   more expensive and is a full-featured Windows 8 computer,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.760]   I'm so glad that I held off on my big, old testament
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.880]   grade-long discussion about Windows RT and the Surface,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.240]   because I just don't know why I would have recommend someone
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.920]   buy the RT instead of $100 more for a full-featured tablet.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.040]   I can explain to somebody why they would want something
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.800]   like the Samsung ATIV instead of a MacBook Air.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.240]   But I can't explain why they would
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   want a Windows RT device instead of something that's so similar,
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.920]   but does so much more.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.400]   Right.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.920]   It's weird.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.480]   I would think the Surface Pro will do better than the Surface RT.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.360]   I mean, it seems like it's a more limited platform.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.200]   There aren't as many applications for it, whereas with the Pro,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.640]   you can run anything that you used to have on Windows.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.960]   Yeah, and again, the weird thing is
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.800]   I was expecting that the Pro would be like $1,000--
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.560]   always be like these $1,000 devices.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.680]   But again, with these low-power Intel chips,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.280]   the ATIV that I started playing with a couple of weeks ago,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.520]   it's only a little bit more expensive.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.680]   The Surface RT is $499.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.360]   The Samsung is $599.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.760]   So for $100 more, you get a device that
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.240]   does absolutely everything that this other device does.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.360]   It's only a little bit larger, has a longer battery life,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.520]   and runs all desktop apps.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.920]   So I think that's Microsoft's big problem with this.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.640]   Although, as you point out, John, on a very nice website,
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.040]   it's a two-headed baby.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.280]   They're trying to be both tablet and desktop.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.040]   And it's hard to do that well.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.600]   In fact, you quote Jacob Nielsen and the Nielsen Norman
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.400]   usability studies.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.040]   They're the usability kings.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.400]   And they said people could be very confused by it.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.200]   Yeah, and it's just a very confusing experience
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.640]   when you're in those two environments at the same time,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.960]   and you have to flip back and forth.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.840]   It seemed like if they could have managed it
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.880]   so that the operating system switched modes,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.760]   so that if you're in a tablet, you only
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.920]   got the tablet experience.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.600]   And if you were running on the desktop,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.920]   if you connected a mouse, maybe you've
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.440]   got the desktop experience only.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.120]   It might have worked a little bit better.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.960]   It's tough to do both.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.720]   That was always my thought, as soon as I saw one, I was eight.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.200]   But I'm telling you, the Metro interface,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.600]   those tiles, there's some really slick stuff going on there.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.600]   Yeah, I like the live updating.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.280]   I mean, I wish the black icons did that.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:45.720]   All right.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.240]   That's right.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.160]   Or iPod.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.600]   Not only that, but I think that Apple
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.560]   might be missing a trick if they always
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.200]   try to keep touch out of the Mac OS.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.840]   Because when you hand more and more,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.600]   you kind of instinctively keep reaching out to the screen
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   to touch something.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   That's right.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.080]   And not just because you were just using an iPhone
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.200]   like 10, 10 seconds ago, I think that people are naturally
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.400]   starting to think of computers as things that you reach out,
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.360]   you touch, and you interact with directly.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.400]   And if Apple continues to maintain
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.440]   this huge barrier between the two,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   I hope that they have a really strong reason to do that,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.040]   as opposed to just a theological reason.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.440]   Do we think long term there is a barrier between iOS and OS 10?
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.200]   I mean, I know we can keep on coming up every time
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.880]   someone says that I go, you know, eventually,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.320]   they're all going to be one operating system.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.880]   I mean, they're not going to-- it's going to be one operating
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.240]   system.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.480]   I think they might--
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.640]   They're slowly merging it.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.480]   They're sneaking up on a horse.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.840]   We're just moving very slowly.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.120]   And every iOS and every OS 10 operating system
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   just keeps on moving together.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.480]   I mean, I don't know exactly when it's going to happen,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.160]   but there's going to be a point where it doesn't--
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.560]   I don't think there's going to be any difference.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.520]   A point in the future, yeah.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.960]   But I don't think it's immediate.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.120]   No, a couple of years.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.640]   Any time soon.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   Two, three, four years.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.640]   Well, it's that time of year we--
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.600]   Go ahead, John.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.000]   There's got to be some room down in Cupertino
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.760]   where they do have a Macbook with a touchscreen.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.800]   I mean, they've got to be working.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.240]   They got us.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.960]   I'm trying it out.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   Or a chest temperature.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.840]   At this point, it just doesn't work for them for some reason.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.600]   People always said, oh, you don't want to hold your arm out.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.760]   You don't want to hold your arm.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.880]   But it isn't that way.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.720]   And that was the experience I had with the Surface, which
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.560]   is sometimes you use your keyboard and mouse.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.440]   And there's times when it's just natural to touch.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.440]   And since we're used to touch, it's just a natural thing.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.560]   And I think that every operating system will do it
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.280]   within two years.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.080]   I have no doubt.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.920]   Whether it's a Logitech case for the iPad
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.000]   or some of the other cases that I've
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.680]   experimented with that has a keyboard,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.120]   I find that the experience of touching the screen and typing
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.520]   and touching the screen and moving things around
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.840]   is totally fluid.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.200]   Like it doesn't bother me at all.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   Exactly.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.160]   Like it doesn't bother me at all.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   But there are a lot of things that I just want to do with my hand
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.440]   and then I want to be able to just type.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.080]   And then I want to go back to whatever I'm doing.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.960]   I don't want to type on the screen.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   It bothers me that I can't boldface something.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.480]   I wouldn't want to do it on a 9-neck.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   Right.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.440]   It just bothers me that when I want to do something
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.480]   that's productive, that to do something
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.200]   as simple as bold-facing a piece of text,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.560]   that I have to very, very carefully type and hit
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.440]   this little boldface button.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.160]   It bothers me that in Apple's own Apple's own word processor,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.680]   I can't use the cursor keys to select a sentence
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.000]   in the middle of a paragraph because that selection process
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.160]   is hardwired into the idea of multi-touch.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.200]   Every time that I extend the selection above a certain point,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.040]   the OS is, oh, you must want to try to select
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.920]   the entire paragraph.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.640]   I'll be a very helpful operating system.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.040]   I'll automatically extend it for him because otherwise,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.440]   it's going to be so hard for him to extend that selection
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.960]   by a touch when that's not really what I want to do.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.040]   Actually, I have a keyboard.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.960]   Please let me just go right to the end of the sentence.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.000]   No, no, no, don't slug the hook.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.200]   Those days are gone, Andy.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.760]   You're just an old fart.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.920]   Well, and I have to say this.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.160]   Seriously, that's the e-max.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.960]   That's like people who--
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.840]   I haven't believed the data, but I
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.880]   know that we're getting to the point
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.680]   where writing a complete sentence is really very old-hat.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   It is its own.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   It's exactly.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.600]   140 characters.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.200]   Every sentence is about every paragraph is 140 characters.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.960]   Don't you understand?
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.080]   This is the future.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.640]   I will say that the selection tools are probably
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.440]   the most frustrating in iOS.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.280]   Probably almost anything in the OS.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.400]   It's very hard to do that with touch.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.680]   It should be a mouse extending.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.840]   Not only is it hard, you don't know--
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.520]   it's like modals.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.320]   So there's all these apps that you touch it,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.640]   and then nothing happens.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.280]   Why is it not flexing?
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.360]   Because I want to--
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.320]   It's very frustrating.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.520]   No, I agree with you.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.560]   I think Apple's a pretty patient when it comes to user
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.720]   interface paradigms.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.640]   And we see what they're doing next with Siri.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.160]   And it will be more natural language.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.720]   And maybe you can't touch your Mac.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.840]   But the eyesight camera will pick up air gestures.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.560]   And you'll be able to move things around that way.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.160]   But that's probably a couple of generations
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   in them waiting for a lot of the market to shake out
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.240]   before they get into it.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.640]   I see a lot of frustration.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.000]   You know what we're talking about this on Twitter?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.520]   There's a bug reporting mechanism.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.720]   Facebook's just put it into its beta versions of its apps.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.040]   What's called the rage shake.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.160]   And if there's a bug, you just go, I hate you.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.680]   And then it goes, oh, I see you have a bug.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.960]   And it reports it.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.600]   And I think that we're going to see a lot more
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.160]   rage shaking going on.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.040]   I don't want a lot of rage shaking,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.720]   but I do notice that I do this a lot.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.880]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.080]   That's the rage shake.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   That's it.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.680]   And I think there's going to be a lot more of that.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.360]   And I think it's very appropriate that they've built that in
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.560]   as their bug reporting.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.000]   Thank you, Ayata.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   That would be great.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.040]   That's all I want.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.320]   He wasn't pissed.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.520]   He was just mountain biking.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.280]   And in theory, some detecting curse words.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.040]   Let's take a break.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.200]   We've got a great team.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   John Moltz is here from a very nice website,
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.520]   very nice website.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.480]   Can just.comwork or just.net?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.240]   I'm below also work, yes.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.720]   You're one of those, are you?
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.080]   Somebody I've been for three years, I've been saying flicker.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.120]   That's flicker without an E.com.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.840]   And somebody pointed out, you know, you could put the E
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.240]   and it doesn't matter.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.760]   I was like, oh, well, all right.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.880]   A very nice website.com.net, whatever you want.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   Also here from the Chicago Sun Times, which
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.040]   hasn't changed in 123 years, Mr. Andy and not.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.360]   How old is the Chicago Sun Times?
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.320]   Oh, it's kind of the--
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.880]   I don't know.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.360]   Well, they do now have decaf in the coffee machine,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.280]   so they do change something.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.480]   Actually, they just hired a new editor
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.720]   to take care of blogs.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.680]   And he's doing some really neat stuff.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.520]   So we do.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.480]   It's always been a fun place to work.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.760]   And now it's even more fun.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.720]   It's like a real newspaper.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.360]   It began in 1844 as the Chicago Evening Journal.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.680]   The first newspaper to publish "Rumor," the rumor,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.440]   now believed "false that a cow was responsible for the Chicago
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.920]   fire."
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.040]   We report you decide.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.720]   Great start.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.400]   Mrs. O'Leary's cow.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.520]   And then the Chicago Sun merged with the Chicago Daily
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.560]   Times in 1948 to form the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.960]   So that's heritage.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.160]   There you go.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   Any paper willing to hire Roger Ebert that will offset
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.560]   this grace of hiring me at United States?
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.200]   I think you two go together.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.360]   Also with us from iMore.com, nice and slow right now
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   because the rumor mill-- well, wait a minute.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.520]   No, there are rumors already.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.760]   There are new rumors.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.800]   We're making rumors about the lack of news, Leo.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.760]   What's going on in Cupertino?
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.360]   Why are they not putting out more products?
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   What's going on?
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.920]   We'll talk about there are some new product rumors,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.520]   believe it or not.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.440]   Lynx, L-Y-N-X is a big cat, the next big cat perhaps.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.160]   And of course, the long lost, prodigal son Alex Lindsey.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.800]   I come back every once in a while.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.320]   I'm still with you.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.120]   Actually, you've been here a lot more.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.880]   Ever since I started saying, oh, you're just never going to be
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.680]   here, let's get Renee.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.480]   Richie, you feel like he comes back now.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.320]   Anyway, no, we always, always love to have you.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.840]   I'm just getting better at delegating.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.600]   That's good.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.800]   Slowly.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.040]   Because business is not slowing down.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.880]   I know you're working on a crazy.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.800]   It's so good.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.400]   What is the name of the company that's doing all this?
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.680]   Is it still Pixelcore?
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.640]   Yes.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.140]   OK.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.040]   Yeah, it's still under Pixelcore.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.720]   Pixelcore.com.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   There was an interesting article about Google
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.240]   and how they use video conferencing.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.960]   The engineers who do their database,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.680]   their massive distributive database, are all over.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.880]   They're also massively distributed.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.080]   And they just turn on-- they call it VC in Google.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.520]   The video conferencing, leave it on all day.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.280]   And they're basically working together
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   through video conferencing.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   That's the future.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   I was talking to an engineer.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.320]   This was an engineer for HP or something at an airport.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.440]   And he said his daughter dropped out of Facebook
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.880]   to go to Google Hangout.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.400]   Google, because of the Hangouts.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.880]   Her and her friends just sit there.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.400]   They leave it on.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:36.720]   They come home.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.520]   They do her homework.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.080]   They literally come.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.920]   They don't even do their homework.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.880]   They said they just leave them on.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.040]   They open up their computers.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.200]   And they turn on Hangouts.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.280]   And then they're all just virtually in the same room
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   together.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.120]   And they're walking in and out of the room
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.080]   and chatting with each other.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.800]   It's as if they were all--
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.400]   Amazing.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   And it's-- anyway, it's pretty nifty.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.320]   I was talking to somebody whose girlfriend lives far away.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.480]   And he watches her sleep.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:03.640]   This show brought to you by--
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.000]   our friends at Ford--
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.880]   Moving right along.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.360]   Moving right along.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   I sounded creepier when I said it out loud.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.560]   I'm watching you sneeze.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.240]   Moving.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.360]   Showed out.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.320]   Actually, I think Andy's-- the show title of the chat
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.240]   room already has decided is it's not a bug.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.280]   I've just done a mountain bike.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:31.320]   Ford, of course, has made some great strides
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.520]   in adding technology to what is essentially--
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.920]   I mean, the automobile, until recently, hadn't changed much
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.840]   from the early days of Ford.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Boy, has it changed now.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.440]   It's become a vehicle for technology.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.000]   In fact, Ford thinks of it as a platform.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   They put the sensors in.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.120]   They put the power in.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.720]   And then they have an API.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.120]   And they encourage developers to develop for it.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.600]   And they are doing their own stuff.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.480]   In fact, they're the new Ford Fusion, which is absolutely
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.720]   my next car.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.160]   I've decided that I'm going to go from having a muscle car.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.360]   I have a 2010 Mustang, which I love,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.720]   to being a responsible citizen driving a plug-in hybrid.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   Nice.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.560]   More than 100 miles per gallon E, that's the new designation.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.840]   It uses electric around town and then
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.640]   goes to the EcoBoost engine if it needs to go longer distance
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.840]   or you need more performance.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.160]   Really cool.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.360]   And this new Fusion, whether you get the plug-in hybrid,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.600]   the hybrid, or the petrol--
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   as my friend Ellen Malawi calls it-- the petrol version.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.560]   We call it gas here in the US.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.280]   Petrol.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.680]   Petrol.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.520]   When I was in Australia, we have so many viewers
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.840]   outside the US, I should call it petrol.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.800]   Yes.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.880]   And Al Uminium.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.040]   I can't get into that.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   Can't get into the--
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   Al Uminium, Al Uminium.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.840]   They'll suck down a lot of bandwidth.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.520]   That extra syllable is really going to cost you.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.040]   Al Uminium.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.880]   So the 2013 Fusion has two new technologies
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.440]   that I think are really interesting.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.600]   We're moving towards--
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.840]   Ford's always told me we don't want
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.320]   to make autonomous vehicles because we learned--
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   Alan was at Boeing for years, Boeing engineer.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.120]   He designed the 777 cockpit.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.880]   And he said, you don't want to get rid of the pilot.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.720]   What you want to do is give the pilot information
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.400]   so they're better pilots.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.480]   You don't want to let the car drive, maybe not yet anyway.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.920]   But you want to have the car be smart enough to give information
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.480]   to the driver that it can use.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.720]   For instance, they've got this new lane keeping thing.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.480]   So there's a dedicated camera in the front of the car
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.680]   that watches one thing, the lanes.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.960]   And then if you veer--
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.040]   do you have the video chat?
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.240]   Because it's really cool.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.320]   If you veer a little bit, first it'll
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.800]   like vibrate the steering wheel.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   It's kind of like Bot Stots.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.160]   Here in California, we have bumps in the road for the lanes.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.880]   And so you go over.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.320]   But this is done by the car.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.440]   And then if you go too far, it actually
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.360]   eases you back into the lane.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.920]   Now somebody said, well, what happens if you decide
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   to change lanes?
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.640]   When you turn on the blinker, it disables it.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.720]   So it knows you're changing lanes intentionally.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.880]   Don't try to be swerving around.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.240]   It's not going to let you do that.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   Well, I'll let you do it.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   But no, Rick, let's do it.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.080]   I just encourage this.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.280]   So this is really cool.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.800]   You'd be fighting like, oh, just--
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.120]   Do you see the driver alert warning rest suggested?
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   This is so cool.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.320]   So this car and-- this camera in the front
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.480]   is watching those stripes.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.440]   And if you start veering out of the lane, it'll let you know.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.560]   And pull you back into the lane.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   You know, this is going to be very difficult in LA though.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.600]   Because the problem is that you're going to--
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.720]   you want to do the Bot St Lane change, which is just like you
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.840]   just don't warn anybody.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.920]   You just start moving over.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.920]   Yeah, don't do that.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.560]   This won't let you do that at all.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.800]   I think you can over--
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.400]   I mean, you can-- it just urges you to do the right thing.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.040]   It just vibrates, right?
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.600]   Yeah, vibrates.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.480]   You know you're doing it.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.000]   It looks great.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.440]   So if you're falling asleep--
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.040]   And it'll let you know if you're falling asleep.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.400]   It's really good.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.520]   And then there's--
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   It fills up your coffee.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.320]   You know what it needs?
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   It needs a little water spritzer.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.200]   So like, if you start-- if you do it twice in a row
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   and like, it's freezing.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   It blows like cold water in your face.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   Hey, wake up.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.760]   And then it's got like a little red bull dispenser.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.520]   And then how about this?
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.640]   There's also radar in the front of the car
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.040]   that's scanning the road ahead.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.640]   And this is so they can do adaptive--
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.200]   I've always wanted this cruise control.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.120]   Normally you set the cruise control.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.120]   You say the same speed.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.400]   This knows what's going on ahead of you.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.120]   It slows you down.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.760]   I was on the five yesterday.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.520]   And people kept on driving slowly in front of me.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.360]   No, this will--
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.880]   But just the cruise control, when slower traffic is detected,
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.440]   it also has a collision warning.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.720]   It'll do a heads up red lights on the windshield flashing
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.640]   red lights if you are about to have a collision.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.320]   I'll say, whoa, oh.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.480]   So it's really-- this is really good.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's in the 2013 Ford Fusion, but it'll be in many others.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.720]   I want you to go to a Ford dealer and test drive it,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.680]   or do as we just did with those videos,
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.720]   go to Ford.com/technology.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.320]   And you can see what they're doing, just amazing stuff.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.760]   I love the idea of a cruise control,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.920]   knowing what the appropriate speed is.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.360]   That's huge.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.440]   That's your better driver.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.920]   Love that.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.120]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.520]   More kids than ever clamor for iPhones and iPads
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.600]   this holiday season.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.880]   Every year they do this.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.920]   They go out and Nielsen does the annual holiday shopping
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.760]   study, Kids Age 6 to 12.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.920]   Number one device, 48% of kids said they wanted an iPad.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.240]   Surprisingly to me, the Nintendo Wii U came in second.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.040]   I'm surprised it's only 48%.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.920]   What kid does not want an iPad?
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.440]   Well, 39% wanted a Wii U.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.480]   I kid who already has one.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Right?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.640]   Then the iPod touch.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.840]   So if you put the iPod touch and the iPad together,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.720]   that's 84% of all respondents.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.760]   Well, but the problem is this isn't a--
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.920]   it's not exclusive.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.040]   So it's not like 40%--
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.720]   Oh, you're right, because 33% iPhone.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   That adds up to a million percent.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.920]   Also, how do they ask the question?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.560]   Do they say if--
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.040]   would you be pleased to--
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.920]   are they saying if you can only get one of these three things?
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.240]   Which one would you take?
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.320]   Also, when people come to game consoles,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.160]   I think most kids that I talk to at least are more aware
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.520]   of what titles are available for what platform they would say.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.040]   I want whatever can play Assassin's Creed, the new one
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.720]   that came out just last month.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.200]   They don't particularly care about the hot technology.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.800]   I'm looking at the Nielsen.com.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.400]   I don't see the question.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.640]   But what's good is they do this every year.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.000]   So you can at least compare apples to apples
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.240]   in terms of year over year changes.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.440]   There's the iPad, the Wii U, the iPod touch.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.600]   The iPad mini is also in there, equal to the iPod touch,
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.920]   both the 36% and then the iPhone.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.160]   Computer is 31%.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.560]   Xbox Connect, not the Xbox, but the Connect 31%.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.320]   A tablet, other than the iPad, this
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.920]   might be a little concerning, 29%.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.680]   So that shows you the awareness that there are--
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.200]   in some ways, surprise, the kids 6 to 12 know there's
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.600]   anything but an iPad out there.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.160]   But they do.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.800]   I saw a lot more-- I was at Disneyland over the weekend.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.400]   And I saw a lot more Android tablets and notes
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   and that type of thing.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.640]   No, the night scene before.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   Older kids, iPad, computer, tablet, computer, other than iPad,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.280]   then the Wii U, the iPhone, and a smart TV.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.880]   And an e-reader, 13%.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.520]   Smart phone, other than iPhone, 12%.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.320]   iPhone's still the winner among the 13 and up kids.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.000]   I don't know how valuable that is,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.280]   but I think it's kind of an interesting.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.600]   They do this every year.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.960]   The spaceship is slowing down.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.600]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.040]   I really looking forward to seeing this new Apple campus
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.000]   in Co-Pretino.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.640]   It does look very futuristic.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   Not ready.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.680]   Maybe, according to Bloomberg until 2016 now.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:39.880]   Because the company is revising its plans,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.680]   there's a new timetable.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.400]   They're getting rid of a bridge.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.360]   They are moving the theater away from--
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.160]   No, no, like literally.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.240]   They're getting rid of a little bridge.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.080]   They're moving the theater away from the road.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.240]   They have less underground parking.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.840]   Those are the three big things that they've changed.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.200]   And these are pretty common for--
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:56.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.480]   --and to make adjustments.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.320]   More trees.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.920]   And you have to get approval each time.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.800]   1,000 seed auditorium.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.240]   That's big.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.760]   That's bigger than the one at the one infinite loop.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.480]   I think one at the loop is like 400 or 500.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.440]   It's tiny.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.200]   But 1,000 is much smaller than Moscone West,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.000]   where they do the big enough.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.920]   Moscone West.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.480]   Well, no, no, when they do the big enough,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.400]   yeah, several thousand.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.800]   But when they do the Europe 1, Europe 1 is about 700, 100.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.400]   So basically what this allows for is at 1,000 people,
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.960]   Apple could theoretically do all their announcements
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.800]   from the campus.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   I bet you that's the plan.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.920]   Because one of the things that the bugs them
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   is that when they book somewhere outside of Apple,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.880]   they're very nice.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.080]   Everybody knows.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.480]   And it's also a much larger cost.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.640]   And I think a lot of reporters are
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.960]   going to want to go to the spaceship.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.400]   2016.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.840]   Maybe by then I'll be invited again.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.560]   I'm hoping they don't move to that for all events,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.360]   because it's difficult enough for people
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.520]   outside of a certain radius of Cupertino to attend these events.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.720]   But now when you add to--
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.640]   now you have to get a hotel within a certain block
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.880]   of-- with a certain closeness to Cupertino now,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.360]   because if you were instead of the huge field
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.000]   to choose from in San Francisco, now it's really
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.720]   as a practical thing.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.880]   You might want to get a hotel in San Jose area
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.720]   and find a flight that will get you to San Jose
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.000]   instead of San Francisco.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It will just add-- at least I did actually calculate this out.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.640]   It will cost me an extra $400 to $500 to attend an event
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.360]   in the-- if it was held held in Cupertino,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   then it's held in San Francisco.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.000]   What are you reading as private bus?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.560]   Well, because I have to get myself from San Francisco
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.160]   down to Cupertino.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.360]   And that could cost--
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.040]   That could fly to San Jose, can't you?
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   Fly to San Jose, yeah.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.480]   Yeah, but when I-- there were more flights--
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.680]   I'm sorry, maybe I'm talking about an Andy problem
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.840]   as opposed to a general problem.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.280]   I think this is an Andy problem.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.840]   It's a big problem.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.920]   San Jose airport is a big airport.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.080]   It's a nice airport.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.200]   It's very comfortable.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   It's a comfortable-- I fly in and out.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:57.920]   --or San Jose a lot.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.120]   But these versions are just--
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:37:59.640]   I'll go.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.520]   But I mean, it's like--
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.640]   Well, here's the question, Andy.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.280]   I'll take Andy's invitation.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.920]   I'll drive.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.280]   Let's get on to the major problem.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.120]   I know that if there's an event in San Francisco,
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.480]   I already know two things for sure.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.400]   I know where I can get my comic books.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.160]   I know where I can get burrito.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.280]   OK, if I know where I can get my comics,
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.600]   I know where I can get a burrito,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.440]   I'm OK having an event in that city.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.400]   I just want to say--
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.360]   I'm going to have to figure this out both those problems.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.520]   There are a lot of good burritos in San Jose.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520]   I know, but which one?
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.600]   Which one?
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.560]   We'll work on that.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.880]   Cupertino comic book--
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   Now, Andy, if they had an event in Boston--
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.440]   Legends, comics, and games, Cupertino, California,
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   I think you're going to like this, Andy.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.200]   Legends, comics, and games.com.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   Let's just go take the look.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.360]   Not only comics, but they have legends.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.400]   They have legends, they have comics, they have games.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.880]   They're just around the corner from the Apple campus.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.600]   Clearly, they use the fonts that you
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.680]   recommend from that company, which McCall it.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.480]   This is good.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.360]   Two stories inside the Valco shopping mall.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.080]   Two stories.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.640]   Oh no, hi.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.480]   Go to a mall.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:14.040]   We can shop next to Scott Forest all Andy.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:14.920]   He's been living there.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.440]   I think actually Scott's got a job now there.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.000]   Go visit.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.560]   Next issue of 47 Ronin together.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.600]   Alex, Alex, you're about to say something about--
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.080]   I'm sure--
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.720]   Well, as a reporter, if you say something that's helpful,
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.960]   I need to know what it is.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.520]   As a reporter, the question is, would you
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.800]   go to a telecast?
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.160]   So it's like a full screen, giant screen
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.120]   with where you're also going to get a chance to test
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.720]   the whatever the new thing is.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.760]   But it would gather you up where you weren't actually
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.520]   in the same room as whoever the speaker was.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.440]   There are two levels of value to me
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.400]   to attending an Apple event.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.960]   Level number one is hands-on, even if it's just 20 or 30 minutes
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.120]   with the actual devices.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.240]   So level two is a meeting with people
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.840]   where I can have ask direct questions to get direct answers.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.600]   But what I'm saying is, if you had people
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.760]   that you could ask questions of, they're not necessarily
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.560]   Tim Cook.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.320]   But they're the people that you would ask the questions of.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.240]   They had all the iPads there.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.160]   But the presentation was on a giant 30-foot screen.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.840]   Would you go?
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.920]   Yes, I would say so.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.600]   All things being equal if I had a chance
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.800]   between either attending an event locally or flying--
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.360]   taking two or three days out of my--
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.600]   Well, that's my guess.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.080]   $1,000 bucks out of my schedule.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.520]   As I said, there are often some side benefits
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.800]   to attending in person.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.600]   I really enjoy the opportunity to reconnect
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.800]   with certain Apple personnel.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.120]   I'm not talking about the private meeting at a hotel suite
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.480]   somewhere in a rooftop area.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.640]   I'm talking about you're waiting in line for half
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.480]   out of 45 minutes.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.760]   And you bump into somebody that you always enjoy
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.480]   bumping into.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.320]   And even though you're just having a 10-minute casual
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.600]   conversation, you always enjoy that 10-minute conversation
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.680]   because Apple has some really cool people working for them.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.720]   I just enjoy seeing those people time and time and time again.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.240]   So it's not as though I would always
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.720]   choose the local over the flight out to get there.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.400]   But at the end of the year where I'm working out, oh, man.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.520]   And now here's--
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.760]   is there somebody I know who has a sofa that's at least
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.480]   better than a sectional that I could sleep for?
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.560]   Is this the only way I could afford to go to this place?
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.520]   Because it's too late in the year,
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.560]   I've already blown my travel budget for the year.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.680]   I'll pick you up on the way down.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.200]   OK.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.760]   We'll drive together.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.240]   We'll carpool.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.360]   Can I sleep in the car?
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.800]   Does he do it for?
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.720]   It's very quiet.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.120]   Because it's electric.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.280]   I'll get one with bench seats.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.560]   Leo can sleep, too, because it drives itself.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.760]   That's right.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.280]   I'll just put on the cruise control and lane correction.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.200]   And I'll just--
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.720]   Right.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.600]   I'll let word ago.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.280]   Good Latino, Jeeves.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.600]   I don't know.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.160]   I think there's going to be a real hot demand for that first
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.400]   meeting at this fish.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:02.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.920]   I hope that they even do things where they're just saying--
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   we know the people are curious.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.680]   We're having a limited open house
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.880]   where if you really want to take a look,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.000]   we've set aside four days spread across six weeks
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.960]   where he just come in.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.840]   And it's not going to be a PR thing.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.160]   It's just going to be a--
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.640]   we would much rather have you and Nimrod's come in all
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   the same day so that we know when
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.200]   to put things over the hover car so that people can't see it
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.760]   when they come in.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.880]   There's a name for those rooms.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.840]   I was talking to Sal Segoi, and he was on the cruise.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.680]   Sal's a longtime Apple employee.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.200]   Since he was there before Jobs came back for a few months,
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.480]   and then Jobs came back and worked a lot with Steve.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.560]   And there's a name for those secret rooms.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.720]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.400]   Shoot.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.480]   Sal's got such stories.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.640]   So the other shoe or the other Q drops--
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.400]   Eddie Q now responsible for IOS, moved over from iTunes.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.760]   In the reorg last month, he's a senior vice president,
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.840]   has fired Richard Williamson.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.200]   He was the guy in charge of maps.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.760]   So Forestop and now Williamson.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.800]   Apple is very much-- or at least Q--
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.520]   is very much taking charge of this and working hard
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.240]   to solve the maps issue.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.080]   In fact, they're even saying--
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.120]   Tom Tom's saying they're being asked to fix landmark
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.200]   and navigation issues, the point of interest issues.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.240]   Yeah, what it sounds like is that I
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.600]   guess Apple has been prioritizing Yelp information, which
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.880]   is not nearly as accurate as the Tom Tom information.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.080]   And so by--
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.200]   I think they're trying to get more of that data from Tom
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.120]   Tom than from Yelp.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.560]   Tom Tom has always said it's not our fault.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.080]   Our stuff works great.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.400]   Of all the mapping that I've used,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.080]   because I've used Tom Tom for probably 15--
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.760]   no, no, 10, 12 years.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.720]   And it's been the most accurate of the bunch that I've used.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.840]   Well, it's pretty clear from this Bloomberg story
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.080]   that Apple is taking the map issue very seriously,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.680]   firing yet another person responsible for it.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.480]   Oh, they have to.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.640]   I mean, this is--
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.760]   I still think one of the largest mistakes
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   that they've made in a long time.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.040]   Do you think, guys, that it hurt the sales of--
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.120]   I know people who have an upgraded iOS 6 with older devices
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.880]   for that reason.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.440]   I wish I hadn't.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.440]   Because the upgrade feels, in that respect,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.320]   like a downgrade, right?
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.640]   Because the web version of Google Maps is not the same
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.960]   as having the map built in.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.120]   And the Apple Maps clearly does not work as well as Google.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.360]   And we're seeing good sales for Samsung devices.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.120]   Samsung just said they have 5 million Galaxy Note 2s
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.400]   in the channel, not sold, not sell through,
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   but 5 million in the channel.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.240]   Do you think people are actually--
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.520]   this is significant enough that people are not buying iPhones
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.800]   as a result?
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.080]   I'm sure some people probably aren't.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.360]   But at the same time, the iPhone 5
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:50.720]   has done well enough to push Apple over Android in October
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.160]   sales, I think, that just came out today in the US.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   They can't make enough of them.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.640]   And that's the other problem.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.400]   I mean, obviously, there's enough demand
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.280]   that can't make enough.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.720]   I think that people--
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.200]   I don't think people are going to be turning down an iPhone
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.560]   because of maps.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.480]   I think it actually works well enough for most people.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.360]   I think people have a low enough set of expectations
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.960]   for maps that it's not a deal breaker for them.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.200]   I think that the reason why Android phones have been selling
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.920]   so well is that they've been making a lot of really great
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.520]   phones.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.640]   Piper, Jeff, which in one's--
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.160]   My wife and wife will curse out any map application.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.120]   Yeah, they're all bad.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.040]   I mean, she--
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.080]   She needs to have the map for years.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.240]   She'll be perfectly fine cursing out Apple maps for years.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.760]   What I still like to know is they brought Eddie Q on
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.480]   and they gave AQ.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.800]   And he's their well-known fixer.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.120]   He was put in charge of Mobile Me.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.040]   He's been put in charge of Siri now.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.640]   And Scott Forestall was let go.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.160]   And they've let go of this gentleman now, too.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.560]   But who are they replacing them with?
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.920]   It's very hard to get--
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.560]   I mean, Google has spent years building up
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.720]   an army of map people.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   And Tom, Tom, they bought--
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.760]   I think they bought Telatless, Nokia bought Navtech.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.640]   They all have armies of mapping people.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.240]   And it's very easy for Google to go out and buy a snap seed
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.280]   or buy another one of these companies
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.000]   and get good designers and good developers
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.480]   and make better looking apps.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.360]   But it's really hard to get the engineers to make good server
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.880]   side infrastructure.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.160]   And that's where Apple keeps having all their pain,
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.400]   whether it's maps having data cleansing, data sanitizing
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.160]   issues or game center falling all over itself.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.280]   And that's going to be really hard to fix.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.440]   We talked about this on Twitter also on Sunday.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   That's why one blogger is recommending
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.360]   that Apple buy Twitter not for the product
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.760]   but for the engineers because Twitter's got engineers
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   who have solved scaling problems.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.200]   I don't know if they have the engineers who
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.240]   could solve the networking issues Apple's having with iCloud
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:38.720]   and so forth.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.160]   But I think they're more usability issues
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.000]   than they are scaling issues.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.800]   Well, and it's hard because I think
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.520]   an average school, engineering school,
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.560]   is not generally pumping out students that are going
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.640]   to be able to go in and make those decisions well.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.240]   I mean, that's 10 years of experience.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.520]   And if you've got 10 or 15 years of engineering experience,
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.280]   you are working for someone and you are generally
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.240]   getting paid well if they can deal with you.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.800]   The point is that it's just that today that is such a big--
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.640]   I know that a lot of the acquisitions we see
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   are just engineering.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   They're hiring lots of people buying the whole company.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.560]   I don't think Twitter solves it.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.800]   I think we're about to say almost the exact same thing.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.640]   I don't think they need more personnel.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.480]   I think they need a fundamental change
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   in their cultural attitude about these kind of apps.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.240]   I think that this is one area in which Apple is kind of out
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.280]   of step with what people are naturally
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.120]   gravitating towards, where they don't want to--
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.840]   they don't want the best closed cloud system ever.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.880]   They'd much rather have an adequate cloud system that
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.360]   lets them do pretty much anything they want to do with data.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.680]   And I think that's one place where Apple's idea of we're
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.760]   going to control everything, but we're
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.560]   going to make it the best experience possible.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.960]   I think if that's one area in which that attitude kind
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.840]   of bites Apple in the butt.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.480]   And I think to further Andy's point,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.400]   I agree with that completely, is that buying Twitter
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.840]   doesn't solve their problems.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.960]   I mean, yes, they can scale, but scaling game center
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.720]   is different.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.880]   Apple's still using web objects for iTunes
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.520]   and for the Apple Store.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.480]   And they're doing a lot to improve cocoa
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.520]   and their programming interfaces every year
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.200]   incrementally.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:20.440]   And there's no sign that there is fearless with services
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.480]   as they are with ditching things like the floppy disk
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.680]   or USB or stuff like that.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.200]   And they really need to be not afraid,
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.680]   but they need to be wary about Google and Amazon
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.400]   and companies that grew up on the cloud.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.040]   And they have to be as fearless in this future thinking
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.120]   in that kind of infrastructure.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.800]   Because when you look at Google now compared to Siri,
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.480]   Apple is falling behind very quickly.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.800]   This is what Patrick Gibson's writing in this blog,
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.120]   Patrick Gibson dot Tumblr dot com.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.440]   He says, all of the web problems Apple's having.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.720]   They can't update their online store
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.200]   without taking it offline.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.560]   For instance, that's kind of, if Amazon had to take
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.040]   a store offline every time they updated it,
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.600]   they would never be online.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   Game center was brought down by that word game, right?
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.440]   - Letterpress.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   - Letterpress.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   - Letterpress.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.760]   - Apple requires you to refriend everyone all the time
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.200]   on Game Center, find my friends in shared photo streams.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.000]   Notes requires an email account to sync.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.120]   App stores and iTunes still powered by web objects,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.560]   which I think many agree is out of date.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.400]   - Way past this time.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.080]   - That was, in matter of fact, when it looked like next
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.520]   was going to go under, not be able to really go forward
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.040]   as a hardware company and neither were they gonna be
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.240]   going forward as an OS company.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.360]   I think Steve Jobs is actually promoting web objects
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   as this is gonna be the engine that powers the modern web.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.520]   I was considered to be like their huge asset
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.040]   and maybe there's a bit of that.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.080]   Well, we have to use Steve's company's tool
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.720]   because of course he said it was the best thing
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.160]   that was out there.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.320]   - I was lucky enough to do it.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.800]   - He says, "I message for Mac lives in an alternate dimension
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.560]   in which time has no ordered sequence."
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.200]   (laughing)
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.080]   And then his last point, Ping.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.920]   His clear apple does not get the web,
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.360]   except for Safari, which is great.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.640]   - Social, I don't think they get social
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.320]   because they're very used to being,
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.640]   it's a command and control system
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.360]   and not a bottom up kind of system.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.040]   So I think that the social end of things,
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.440]   other than the personal,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   I'm gonna contact my friends and family and so on and so forth.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.080]   But the general social window is something
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.560]   that I don't think Apple necessarily has a way to handle.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.040]   - Gibson says that Apple has a historic inability
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.440]   to recruit and keep talented web engineers.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.280]   I mean, he worked there, so I don't know
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.800]   what the facts are.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.200]   - I was lucky enough to do a couple interviews
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.520]   with Guy English of, we did Lauren Bricher
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.160]   who did Letterpress two weeks ago.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.360]   And we did Paula Dodd from TapBots yesterday.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.200]   - Oh, Nate.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.040]   - And when you hear them talking about how hard it is
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   to write against Game Center APIs
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.760]   or that iCloud will just stop syncing
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.320]   and start syncing on the same device.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.000]   And I think Instacast just announced that they're gonna
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   stop using iCloud because it's unpredictable
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.160]   and opaque to them.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.760]   And that's the kind of problem you have
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.440]   when Google's plowing ahead with great web services
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.360]   in Amazon as an Apple still struggling to get core OS
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.580]   functionality working.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.360]   - We were talking about supply problems
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.680]   with iPhone 5 but according to Gene Munster at Piper Jaffrey,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.600]   nightly checks of supplies at 100 Apple stores
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.920]   showed significant improvements over the past 10 days.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.680]   Maybe the lack of supply hump is over.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.120]   That always happens, right?
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.440]   Just in time for Christmas.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.040]   - This has been a pretty long one.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.880]   - Yes.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.240]   - You know, as far as the lack of supply means.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.720]   - It was hard for them to make, I think.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.560]   - There was a, I think the four, I think were the three.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.480]   - The four was really bad too.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.320]   - The four was really bad.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.160]   - The four was really bad.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.120]   - And internationally it wasn't even released
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.520]   for a month after the rest of the version.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.280]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.040]   - And according to all things D, the costs of the iPhone
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.560]   may be a problem.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.080]   John Pachowski says it's cost them so much.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.560]   It's the first kind of low margin device
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.520]   or actually he's quoting an analyst
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.440]   from Pacific Crest Andy Hargreaves
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.880]   who says the gross profit per device has risen
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.920]   as high as it'll ever go.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.880]   The cost of goods for the iPhone 5 is,
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.600]   he says $370, which I don't, that seems a little high,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.120]   which will trim their gross margin significantly.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.600]   It's still pretty good margin.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.120]   - It's an incredible margin for this type of,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.720]   I mean, you know, for the,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.240]   it's a lot better than Dell's getting,
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   I'll tell you that.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.920]   - But we have moved from the gourmet ice cream
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.000]   to the regular dryers, I guess.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.080]   - The funny part is they'll say
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.040]   Apple needs another billion dollar product
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.280]   to make up for this shortfall.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.120]   - Exactly.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.960]   - Yeah.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.400]   - Very few companies are putting out products
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.760]   at the level Apple is and yet Apple needs another billion dollar.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   - Not billion.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   Hargreaves says $100 billion product.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.360]   A billion dollar product's not gonna solve the problem.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.200]   - Yeah.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.960]   - You need a hundred billion dollar product, eh?
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.800]   - Another one.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.480]   - We're concerned because Apple seems to be focused
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.760]   on just making computers for the near future.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.560]   They haven't come up with the next disruptive technology.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.400]   - Well, I think if some are,
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.600]   some are right Ryan Block at the gadget says
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.640]   it's gonna be wearable computers next.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.120]   - That's the next big product from Apple.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.360]   Wearable tech glasses.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.000]   Google thinks it's glasses.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.240]   Others are working at Microsoft just patented glasses.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.360]   - It's hard to tell what Google really is up to
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.400]   with the glasses.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.320]   They make, it's also, they're developing technologies
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.680]   for self-driving cars just to bring it back to
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.280]   make it look back to something else.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.120]   - Right, right.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:26.960]   - Full circle.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.040]   - And it's hard to figure out exactly
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.200]   where they're gonna make their money
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.600]   from this as a standalone thing.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.040]   You see it more as an incubator for a whole bunch of patents
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.920]   that they could then license out to other people
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.360]   rather than what they can do.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.920]   Similarly, when you think of them doing Google glasses,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.440]   you wonder what they're gonna do with this as a product.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.560]   Given that the best that they can do right now
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.440]   is that sometime at the end of next year,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.320]   if you have $1,800, we'll sell you a developer kit,
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.520]   which we are telling you upfront is not going to be
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.960]   very, very useful as consumer product.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   So it's fun when you see a company that has that much money
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.840]   that's making so much profit off of their core business,
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.840]   they can feel like we're gonna start to build
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.040]   weird stuff because it seems interesting.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.640]   - I don't think it's money 10 years from now.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.480]   - I don't think so.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.080]   I think that I think Google's, I mean,
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.480]   number one is last week, I think it was announced
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.160]   that Google gets more in advertising
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.280]   than the entire print industry combined.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.120]   - Wow, right.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.920]   - I mean, that's a, you know, so they're doing okay.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.960]   But what makes that work is people being,
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.640]   having their connection to the cloud be ubiquitous.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.280]   That's why you do a gigabit connection.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.480]   That's why you do a car where you don't have to drive
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.800]   so that you can surf.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.280]   That's why you have a glass on so that it's with you
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.960]   all the time and you can be connected to that cloud.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.800]   - And they've always said that.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.480]   - And the more you use the net, the more we make.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.400]   - And it's, and when you look at how they benefit
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.880]   their advertisers based on, you know,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.040]   when you're looking at a Google ad,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.960]   those ads that show up on your Google search
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.440]   are not just the people who paid the most,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   or the people who paid the most
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.080]   that had the most effective advertising
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.200]   that people clicked through the most often
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.840]   so they had to perform as well.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.000]   And that information combined,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.360]   it becomes more and more powerful,
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.080]   the more ubiquitous the internet is to you.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.560]   And so I think that the glass, the,
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.200]   I mean, all of that stuff to me seems to fit very,
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.040]   very, very powerfully into a overall strategy
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.920]   to keep people on the web all the time.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.120]   - And I can tell you as somebody who was on a boat
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.240]   with very constrained internet,
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.320]   this stuff is crap without the internet.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.480]   None of this stuff works.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.280]   It's worth anything.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.600]   I've played Plants vs Zombies for two weeks
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.000]   'cause I couldn't do anything else.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.840]   - Right.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.880]   - Could we compare this though to the way that Apple
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.160]   and Amazon have both done similar types of products
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:42.160]   where the iPhone with love and five years of perspective,
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.560]   we can admit was not a really great phone
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.920]   compared to what other phones were able to do at that time.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.240]   It was great because it was so new.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.880]   It was great because it was gonna be relevant
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.600]   for the next stage of computing,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.000]   but there's so many basic features that it was missing.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.880]   But it still worked as the thing they were selling it for.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.440]   Same thing for when Amazon sold the first Kindle.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:05.080]   It was not a great device, it cost $400.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.760]   But for the idea of being a digital book reader,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.880]   it was very functional and very practical.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.360]   Google Glass as they're pitching it right now
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.440]   isn't really very good for very much.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.720]   The self-driving car is good for PR.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.760]   It's not the sort of thing that, I mean, socially,
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.840]   I'm talking about it, socially as the thing
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.600]   that the human race is ready for right now,
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.920]   we are not ready for to jump into a car
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.680]   that does not have a visible driver
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.040]   and then just trust is going to work for itself.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.560]   So that's where I think the difference is.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.240]   - I think the car is further off,
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.640]   but I think that when you look at the glass,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.880]   I mean, my wife saw it, the demos of the glass,
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.840]   and the whole thing was for her,
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.480]   the idea that she could be watching her kids
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.520]   and click the side of the glass and start recording,
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.640]   or touch the side of the glass
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.000]   and start sharing it with her mom,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.080]   that was my wife, that wasn't me,
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.400]   that was my wife who's not the most technical person.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.000]   - How about this product instead?
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.280]   - Right now, today, you start working on a pair of glasses
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.360]   that's designed to do nothing but geo-tagged photos.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.240]   It connects to, it has a Bluetooth connection to your phone,
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.920]   it uses that for connection to the internet.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   It's not there for augmented reality,
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.080]   it's just so that anytime you're seeing something
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.240]   that you want to share with something,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   you touch a button, it simply takes a two megapixel image,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.200]   pushes it down to your phone
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:20.880]   and app on the phone,
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.680]   pushes it out to the internet immediately.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.640]   That's the sort of thing that could be built today.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.240]   There are already glasses kind of like that
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.160]   that are missing only the Bluetooth component
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   and they could ship that as a really great consumer level
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.880]   product, probably not for that much money,
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   starting, it could have been done in time
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.840]   for the holiday season.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.800]   - I think as a one trick pony,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.040]   I don't know if that's something people
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   don't wear all the time.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.520]   I mean, I think that's the real question.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.360]   I mean, I think that--
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.160]   - For all we know, that's all the Google glasses do.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.160]   I mean, we've never seen it do anything more than that.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.920]   - Well, they did hangouts with them.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.000]   - I mean, the Google glasses.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.320]   I mean, that's what they've done.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.760]   - They were using it as a video camera.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.040]   - So they're glasses that let you watch your girlfriend sleep.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:00.880]   - Right.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.240]   (laughing)
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.080]   - I said, "I don't know, let's--"
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.560]   - You let's Google give him creepier.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.200]   - The glasses let you watch what your girlfriend is watching
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.160]   while she's sleeping.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.560]   - Google, one of those is let them work.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.080]   - They said video, they didn't even,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.920]   I don't, you know better than I, what they did,
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.760]   but it's looked like they had the glasses,
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.560]   they were sending video from the glasses
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.680]   and they had it, but it wasn't,
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.880]   the glasses weren't standalone, it was as Andy said.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.920]   I don't even, I think they had a hardware connection,
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.520]   but they had a connection to a phone.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.120]   - I think in the behind the scenes,
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.920]   they were talking about that on the videos
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.320]   that that was just because of the addressing of the micro,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.160]   you know that they had these--
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.280]   - Because they had a game, a microwave antenna.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.400]   - And Sergey was showing them using these big microwaves
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.040]   to do that, but I think that that was the,
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.360]   that was just a man who's that problem.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.840]   - I know you're kind of caught
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.840]   in a little bit of a difficult position here,
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.520]   but what more could Google glasses do
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.960]   besides take pictures or maybe send video?
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.720]   What more would you like to see them do?
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.920]   You want to see augmented reality?
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.640]   As you look around, you see what stores--
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   - I don't know what they're gonna do with it.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.520]   I know what I, when I think of the Google Glass,
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.120]   what I think of is augmented,
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.720]   not augmented reality, like I don't want things
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.040]   floating around in front of me,
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.080]   but I want to be able to, if I'm looking at something,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.920]   know how much it costs, I want to be able to never have
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.960]   to think of someone's name again,
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.760]   'cause it's a special recognition and it goes,
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.640]   and it just goes like, floating under everybody is like Andy,
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.680]   Leo, and that's that when you think of facial recognition,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.520]   that's a total--
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.680]   - That's what Bernat says in the chatroom.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.360]   He says, "It's dark, not from demon, it is."
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.960]   - You know, you have a reputation score
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.800]   floating over your head.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.080]   - You can have, you know, the thing is,
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.960]   and when I think of that, I think of being able to call
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.080]   someone, doing a video call where I'm calling them
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.720]   and showing them, and when I look at like,
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.800]   for us, a lot of our needs are to,
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.680]   like we want to train someone on how to use a camera
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.080]   that's halfway around the world,
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.680]   and if I have a glass and they have glass,
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.520]   I can sit there and talk to them and go,
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.200]   okay, we're both looking at the same camera.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.120]   I need you to plug in this button,
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.200]   I need you to do this here, and I see what they see,
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.680]   and they see what I see, and I think a lot of that stuff is,
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.560]   I think that it's gonna be a very niche market
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.720]   when it begins, it's gonna be,
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.400]   they're gonna be expensive, and they're gonna be,
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.640]   but I think that having that connected all the time to me
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.200]   is something that, and I thought it was just me,
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.040]   I thought it was geeky enough,
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.440]   that it was just me getting excited about it,
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.320]   but when my wife saw it, the idea of being able
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.040]   to connect quickly and have that information right with you,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.720]   I think is a pretty compelling model,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.520]   from what they've shown so far, and from my imagination.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.920]   - For me though, it's gonna solve a,
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.160]   Google's business isn't doing a lot of this stuff
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.000]   that we see on the front,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.160]   Google's business is data collection and data aggregation
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.720]   that they use to channel their advertising,
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.080]   their marketing, everything else,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.280]   and Google Glass, when you think about what problem it solves,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.120]   the impression I get is that it's solving a Google problem,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.600]   it's solving a way to collect even more data
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.080]   from everybody all the time, and for example,
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.920]   Alex is wearing this and he goes into the store
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.320]   and he buys a can of Coke, and it's nice that Alex
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.960]   can compare a shop, but Google finds out,
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.440]   oh, you're buying Coke, how valuable is it to you
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.880]   to find out that people are buying Coke instead of Pepsi?
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.600]   Oh, and Lays Potato Chips, would you like to know
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.160]   that he's buying this in conjunction,
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.480]   and suddenly they have a huge customer insight play,
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.400]   which is the next generation of ad sense
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.240]   and all these technologies.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.840]   - But I think as a user, you're also gonna be more
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.640]   likely to use it if you are,
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.080]   if I don't have to pull it out of my pocket,
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:05.920]   and I don't have to think about it,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.520]   I can just sit there, hit it, and just be able to,
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.360]   it becomes this thing that becomes--
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.960]   - That's what they want, Alex.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.280]   - I know, but it means that all your,
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.000]   I mean, at some point in time, you have to realize that,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.680]   I mean, I think we all have to,
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.240]   and people have talked about this for a long time,
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.120]   that your life is going to,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   if you've decided to buy into this,
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.560]   you're either gonna use cash and sand off your fingerprints,
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.680]   or your life is gonna be fairly transparent.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.600]   - You know, and there's not,
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.680]   there's only two avenues you can go there.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.960]   I mean, it's not, if we're using these devices,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.400]   we're giving up most of our, you know,
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.360]   most of our privacy at this point.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.680]   - I just wanna charge more for mine.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   - Yes, right.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.880]   It should be an explicit deal.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.040]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.880]   - Yeah.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.560]   - Well, I think,
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.960]   I think a lot of times, you're, you meet,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.840]   I decide when I'm gonna, you know, have searches,
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.760]   and I mean, there is stuff that you have to pay attention,
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.640]   you like, Spotify, I don't ever want people to know
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.840]   that I'm listening to Katy Perry,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.560]   so I typically would have owned a private.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.240]   - You know, baby, you're a thi-a-word.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.400]   - I like Katy Perry.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.240]   - I like Katy Perry.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.080]   - Did you see the movie?
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.920]   - The movie is great, it's not good, yeah.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.680]   - She's great, I love it.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.760]   - It's a funny way.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.000]   So, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.560]   - I watched that movie.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.840]   - I watched it on a flight, it was great.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.600]   - She grabbed my wife with Russell Brand during it.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.800]   - It was, it was, it was, it was really, it was actually,
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   did you, everybody on that plane says,
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.200]   oh, she's, oh, so, she's available now.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.600]   (laughing)
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.240]   - Oh God.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.720]   - They're talking about guilty pleasures.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.560]   - I know.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.640]   - We're gonna take a break now.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.480]   - Yeah.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.400]   - The show brought to you by our good friends
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.320]   at squarespace squarespace.com.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.240]   Alex is a big Squarespace fan, I know.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.720]   Anybody who's paid money to get a website,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.080]   - A website, man, knows really what a great deal
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.400]   squarespace is.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.760]   - I mean, you don't, you know, I don't wanna tell you
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.640]   how much we've spent on web sites in the last two years.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.720]   - Anytime someone says, well, I'm thinking about building
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.520]   a website, I'm just like, okay, somewhere down the road,
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.800]   you might have engineers, everything else,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.520]   but right now, just get squarespace.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.360]   - Yeah.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.480]   - And you can, you can ride that for a long time.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.920]   You don't have to worry about installing,
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.760]   you don't have to know anything about a remote server,
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.600]   you don't have to understand how only that stuff works.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.440]   All you do is you just design it and it works.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.200]   - And it's good, I, you know, I still go to sites
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.280]   where they have a, including ours,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.320]   where they have a desktop site and a mobile site.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.760]   You know, this is very, this is the old fashioned way
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.600]   of doing it.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.760]   You have two different sites and it looks and says,
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.480]   oh, you're on an iPhone, I'm gonna give you this site.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.920]   And really, that does, it breaks all the time.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   It's a terrible way of doing things.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.880]   Squarespace is doing the more modern thing.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.640]   In fact, this is part of the new Squarespace 6,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.920]   which just came out.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.560]   It's called mobile responsive design
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.120]   where the site is this one site.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.880]   You design a site that you like how it looks.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.400]   Squarespace handles the back end
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.760]   so that it can make that site fit any size,
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.680]   any resolution, any aspect ratio screen.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.280]   And they all look good.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.440]   I mean, things like that, that really,
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.760]   that are hard to do.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.600]   And that a lot of web design firms
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.920]   don't know how to do it, but Squarespace does it all for you.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.160]   It's part of the deal, I'm what a deal.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.920]   Try Squarespace for two weeks, absolutely free.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.320]   And if you decide you wanna buy Squarespace,
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.520]   $8 a month for the basic plan when you buy an annual plan.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.640]   And the annual plan, by the way,
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.960]   includes a custom domain registration.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.080]   They hook that up so it can be,
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.160]   AlexLindsay's cool website.com.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.600]   And that's now gonna go to your Squarespace site automatically.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.760]   But I have to say the best deal is the $16 a month.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   - I don't even buy an annual plan.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.720]   I don't know how they make it work either
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.360]   'cause it's unlimited pages, galleries, blogs,
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.280]   unlimited bandwidth.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.800]   That's the one where most of the time,
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   and again, I speak to my own experience.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.600]   When you buy web hosting,
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.720]   they'll give you a certain amount of bandwidth.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.840]   And then you want more, you have to pay for it a lot.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.720]   - And you wanna think about this
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.760]   because if you're having a dream
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.720]   that your website's gonna sometime be really popular,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.800]   you have to think about what happens
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.280]   if you get that big PR hit
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.600]   that's gonna send all those people there.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.640]   You don't want that to get shut down
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.880]   because in my opinion, if you're not putting a website up,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.320]   if you're putting a website up for vanity,
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.800]   I mean, you should just use Facebook or G+
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.880]   or something like that.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.640]   - If you wanna do business or do a gallery
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.960]   or a photographer, you wanna show off your stuff.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.840]   And suddenly, somebody,
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.160]   bookmarks you on Google+, or Facebook,
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.000]   and you get millions of hits.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.600]   Facebook, not only does Squarespace,
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.840]   not only does not slow down,
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.840]   not only is it up and running,
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.880]   but they don't ever meet your the bandwidth.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.760]   - Well, and I used to worry about it
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.680]   'cause we'd have, our sites are all on,
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.080]   so you can get Squarespace if you don't.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.960]   - And I would go, so are you gonna be able to handle this
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.200]   'cause we're gonna do this big PR or whatever,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.560]   and like, oh, no worries, we're putting a big movie up there.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.400]   - Yeah.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.240]   - Oh, no problem.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.640]   - Yep, it's amazing.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.320]   So here's the deal, go to squarespace.com, try it.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.080]   Absolutely free, you don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.320]   All you need is just, you know, say, I wanna try it.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.360]   For two weeks, you can import all your existing stuff.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.680]   They support TypePad, Blogger, WordPress.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.280]   And when I say all your existing stuff,
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.120]   not just the content, not just the images,
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.800]   all the links, all the SEOs preserved of you
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.520]   and all the comments get imported in
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.480]   and can be exported out at any time.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.800]   Try the design, they've all these great designer templates,
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.480]   lots of new features.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.840]   If you decide after, you know, 14 days,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.160]   this is pretty good.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.600]   Take advantage of our special offer.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.240]   MacBreak 11 is the offer code.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.160]   You'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.560]   That's why the annual purchase makes a lot of sense.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.720]   MacBreak followed by the number 11,
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.960]   'cause it's the 11th month, we change it ever.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.840]   So if you hear this ad in a couple of days,
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.560]   it's December, MacBreak 12 would be the offer code.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.840]   I don't know how that works.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.720]   Do they honor MacBreak 11 once we get to December?
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.560]   I believe so.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.400]   Okay.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   So the signal then is to them is,
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.400]   I heard this on a November MacBreak.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.240]   Right.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.080]   I got it, okay.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.200]   But also, I mean, it may change,
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.120]   December might have a different offer.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:31.960]   So we don't know.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.240]   So MacBreak 11 used that one.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.240]   Johnson, he's smart.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.080]   He knows.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:36.920]   He's the man with the plan.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.440]   I gotta listen to Chad more often.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.520]   Anyway, you're gonna love it.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.880]   Squarespace.com.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.960]   It is the secret behind exceptional websites,
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.440]   especially if you're a photographer,
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.800]   an artist, somebody who really wants a great-looking portfolio.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.400]   You want it to look as good as your stuff does.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.600]   This is a great place to start.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.520]   Squarespace.com.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.880]   And we thank them so much for their support
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.420]   of all of our shows.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.960]   Ah, let's see.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.280]   We were talking about the iPhone, profits per device.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.120]   Interesting.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.800]   Somebody in the chat room quoted once again,
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.000]   "Harest, Eddie, you, he's doing,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.440]   he's an amazing guy, the Asymco blogger."
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.000]   Talking about the fact that Apple actually may be kind of
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.800]   at the peak of what it can do
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.720]   based on penetration into markets.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.440]   He says, "They're roughly 800 plus cell phone carriers
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.240]   in the world."
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.080]   Apple says it's now at 275.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.240]   But if you like how the number of subscribers,
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.280]   you know, Apple has, I can't remember what it was,
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.840]   something like 33% penetration with subscribers.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.160]   He says, "The problem is gonna be
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.840]   that you have already doubled production,
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.240]   you cannot continue to work,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.160]   because you need to do a new phone every year,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.360]   the carriers demand it,
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.440]   and you need to be able to produce them
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.480]   and get them into all those markets
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.880]   very, within a year, in the giant numbers,
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.840]   it may be saturated, basically.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.840]   They may have hit the edge of the line
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.320]   in terms of growth on the iPhone.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.400]   Well, I guess, but one of the big news items
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.920]   that came out last week, I don't know if it's on our list
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.360]   or not, is the fact that Apple is still working on,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.400]   you know, China mobile, which would be--
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.240]   Right.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.520]   Which is--
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.360]   Hence.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360]   But that would, the problem.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.880]   You mean as far as just producing the--
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.120]   Well, I think that FoxCon just needs to get bigger.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   (laughs)
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.400]   It comes to a point where you're employing
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.880]   every person in China.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.320]   And you know, yeah.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.120]   You can't, you can't employ anymore.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.160]   I, I look at Horace is really good.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.240]   His blog is--
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.440]   I mean, I think that these pinches,
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.040]   when we say that they can't produce enough of them,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.280]   I mean, you have a pinch for the first month,
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.160]   and then after that, it's, maybe you'll have a pinch
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.920]   for two months, maybe people have to wait for three months
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.440]   before they buy their, before they get their new iPhone 6
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.040]   or whatever, but I don't think that that necessarily
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.960]   is a means that they can't address the market.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.560]   I think they may, they can't address it on day one.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.360]   I don't, I don't know if that's totally.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.480]   Okay, that's fair, that's fair.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.320]   He says--
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.480]   They use their rollouts again, like they used to.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.400]   It's a really interesting article.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.680]   He says he's, you know, they're having a conference in January.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.760]   There will be an opportunity to debate this live
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.160]   within a gust audience.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.000]   There you go.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.760]   Yeah, so, maybe you should go and you can, you can say,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.240]   "Well, wait a minute, where are they doing it?"
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.000]   I don't know, he's from, he's from Finland, so--
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.600]   I think he doesn't have Amsterdam.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.440]   Amsterdam?
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.280]   Okay.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.120]   I'd like to go 'cause more and more,
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.160]   I've been reading his blog as a really good source of very,
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.320]   and he's, he's numbers driven.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.200]   So he always, very interesting analysis there.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.280]   Artist--
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.520]   (laughs)
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.360]   When I left, iTunes 11 was on, was almost, was--
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.040]   And then it, and now it's December, right?
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.360]   According to a post on the MacRumors forums,
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.800]   Apple is asking record labels to get their pictures
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   and galleries to iTunes for use in iTunes 11's new layout
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.680]   in the next few days.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.160]   Chop, chop.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.040]   November is almost over.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.400]   (laughs)
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.200]   Supposed to ship by the end of November.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.840]   What day is today?
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   November 27th?
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.680]   Getting pretty close.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.440]   End of November, four days.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.000]   Four days to ship or delay?
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.240]   Ship or delay, that's--
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.080]   Great artists ship in the words of Steve Jobs.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.240]   But it's interesting because, I mean, they, they postponed
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.360]   iTunes 11, it wasn't a case where they had a deadline,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.720]   they decided it was an internal deadline,
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.040]   they were gonna ship and maybe it would be
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.120]   a really bad experience they'd have.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.680]   Not the maps problem all over again,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.840]   but another case about Apple's rushing out,
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.600]   they're not producing great software,
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.760]   they're fraying around the seams.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.240]   So this time they chose to actually say,
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.520]   we're delaying this for a month
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.480]   and we wanna make a better product.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.120]   They'd have to do it by Friday.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.960]   Chop, chop.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.240]   I don't know if I care.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.080]   Do you care?
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.160]   Yeah, I guess they do something significant.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   No, not really.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.320]   What's, what's more embarrassing being like,
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   if six weeks late on delivery or releasing the next,
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.760]   the thing that makes you forget all about
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.120]   how bad maps is.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.520]   (laughing)
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.800]   It's a pretty drastic update too.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.960]   I kinda wonder if it's kind of a weird time
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.720]   to release it right before Christmas,
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.920]   when people are gonna be plugging in their new iPads
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.760]   and iPod touches.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.520]   What if it breaks, what if it's sudden?
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.000]   (laughing)
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.200]   I mean, it was like January.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.880]   There was a great letter from Steve Jobs after a mobile me
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.720]   when he said that, you know,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.040]   "Apple should learn from this mistake
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.520]   "and we should have rolled out one thing at a time,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.040]   "taking it done mail and then done calendars
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.240]   "and then done contacts and not rushed.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.920]   "And we shouldn't have done the iPhone 3G
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.840]   "at the same time as the App Store
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.400]   "at the same time as iOS.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.160]   "And we should learn from these mistakes."
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.400]   And it doesn't look like they're always learning from them,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   but it does look like with iTunes 11,
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.640]   they took a page from that and said,
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.200]   "You know, let's take our time and get it right
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.000]   "and not have another embarrassing incident."
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.480]   (laughing)
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.680]   This is a new Apple though.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.280]   This is the Apple that supposedly can multitask, right?
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.920]   That's a big change under Tim Cook.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.120]   The Apple that can do more than one.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.040]   - Wow, over time.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.480]   He's only been here for a little while.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.760]   - It's a year.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.080]   Still, the iMacs haven't shipped.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.160]   Yeah, I mean, they're coming.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.000]   - Yeah.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.840]   - They weren't really saying time.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.960]   - It was, I remember very well when Apple said,
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.560]   "Hey, we're gonna push off OS 10 update
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.800]   "because we've gotta do this iOS update
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.120]   "and we can't do both."
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:10.960]   Remember that?
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.120]   That was kind of a shocker.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.160]   - Engineers.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.760]   - If you're saying something important,
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.600]   hold on 'cause my headphones have.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   (laughing)
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.720]   - I can't hear a thing.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.880]   - Well, that's the difficulty of being a celebrity company
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.120]   like Apple, where if those of us who,
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.280]   like if we're like a day late on a report,
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.920]   or if let's say that we were to, you know,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.960]   trip and fall outside of a liquor store
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.880]   after buying simply like a bottle,
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.520]   a nice bottle of wine 'cause we're seeing our parents tomorrow.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.800]   If you're a celebrity, that's all over every paper
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.200]   and everybody's saying all kinds of nasty things about you.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.720]   If you're just a regular person, people say,
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.400]   "Okay, well he tripped and fell, I bet he was,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.840]   "it was a day before Thanksgiving,
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.680]   "he was probably buying a lovely bottle of water,
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.880]   "but bottle of wine for his parents."
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.280]   Apple, any other company says that we plan to release this
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.800]   on this timeframe, "Okay, we're two months late,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.080]   "any other company would be, okay, who cares?"
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080]   With Apple, for some reason, people hold them
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.720]   to a higher standard either because, you know,
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.800]   they're used to such dazzling performance from them
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.640]   in the past or because they just like to report something
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.040]   that's kind of nasty about Apple.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.360]   I think there's some of that, a little shot in Freud.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.200]   Beatmaster says they're just waiting for the show to end.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.800]   Right. (laughs)
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.680]   Just a, we'll see, we'll see.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.120]   Okay, let's be spiteful.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.360]   Gee, I wonder, I guess, you know,
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.600]   I bet that Microsoft could build a parking garage
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.520]   with as many cars as they originally planned.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.520]   Why are they suddenly cutting back?
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.720]   The Longhorn parking garage.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.360]   Are they anticipating, are they just betting mass layoffs?
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.200]   Is that the reason why?
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   I mean, I'm next on TMZ.com.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.040]   I like it. (laughs)
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.600]   T-Mobile says, speaking of, I'm seriously waiting
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.680]   for someone to start spreading.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.440]   Oh yeah, that's a good one, I like that, yeah.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.280]   No, no, no, it's a stupid rumor.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.320]   That's a good, actually, that's a,
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.360]   maybe we should start, that's a really good use for rumors.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.560]   We should start putting out really, really,
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.080]   awesomely stupid ones so that anybody who passes it on,
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.200]   that's sort of like a signal, like a shovel of,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.440]   that will indicate that, okay, if this person is an idiot,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.880]   I can unfollow them immediately and not miss anything
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.720]   they're gonna say.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.040]   That would leave you with a very short list of people
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.480]   on Twitter, so much free-
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.240]   I'm gonna show them Cooper experiment, Andy.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.160]   It's gonna leave him as Zinga.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   Zinga.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.680]   I'm gonna platter to the extent that an idea of mine
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.240]   could've been come up with by Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.920]   (laughs)
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.960]   T-Mobile executive says, the iPhone isn't worth
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.040]   the sacrifice that you have to make.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.200]   Jim Ailing, COO of T-Mobile USA.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.720]   Well, he's kind of making lemons at a lemonade.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.520]   We're glad we don't have the iPhone.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.680]   We recognize--
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.000]   - Says the fourth place network.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.160]   - Yeah, the fourth place network says,
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.040]   not having the iPhone has been detrimental.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.640]   He said, we recognize this has been a point of churn for us.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.720]   It's a point of churn.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.200]   - The fourth place network that will help you convert
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.880]   your iPod, your iPhone from an iPhone--
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.280]   - They work carrier to their systems.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.120]   - Right.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.680]   - We're really rolling out non-AWS of 3G as fast as they can.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.280]   - We are bleeding to death,
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.280]   but we're doing it on our own terms.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.760]   (laughs)
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.600]   - We're keeping it real.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.440]   - We're alive.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.880]   (laughs)
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.040]   - Okay.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.200]   (laughs)
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.920]   - Harold's character in Austin Powers.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.320]   - Barclays Bank bought 8500 iPads.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.840]   That's the biggest purchase of iPads
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   in the financial sector ever.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.320]   One of the largest rollouts.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.760]   Barclays said that staff had demanded
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.080]   the reassuringly expensive pad
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.760]   over other shiny devices.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.920]   (laughs)
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.480]   That's quite right.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.760]   The device will be used to assist branch colleagues
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.880]   to interact with customers,
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.120]   improving the customer experience.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.360]   Well, you see, I've got an iPad,
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.120]   so that's better.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.440]   I don't know whether that's going to be--
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.280]   - A lot of that.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.720]   I mean, you see this in more stores where a--
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.840]   - I hope the bank's not going to use pay with Square.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.600]   - No, no, I think it's typically for a lot of these
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.280]   at retail outlets that, I've seen a couple of these,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.080]   actually in the UK more than the United States,
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.440]   where someone to walk up and they have an iPhone
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.240]   and you're asking a question, or iPad,
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.720]   they're asking a question and they can be pulling up data
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.640]   that would be very difficult for them to carry around
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.120]   with a laptop.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.960]   - Right.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.760]   - And so they just have to have one that allows them
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.280]   to pull up information quicker.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.120]   I think that that's all they're going to--
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:43.000]   - Apple has announced breaking news that iTunes,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.280]   no, I'm sorry, the iMac will be available Friday.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.840]   - The new skinny one, in 21 and a half inch.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.200]   - They should do the whole thing.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.040]   - Wave a thin.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.200]   - Wave a thin.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.840]   The Wave a thin 27 inch model is still on for December.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.840]   So starting Friday, we can order that 21 inch skinny Mac.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.360]   - Friction stir welded, skinny Mac.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.640]   - Friction stir welded.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.960]   I love just being able to throw that phrase around.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.880]   - Oh yeah, it was friction stir welded.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.840]   - I don't hear any word in that description
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.240]   that indicates that any of the screwdrivers in my toolbox
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.480]   will be of any use for a tool ever.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.320]   - You're into you not.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.160]   I promise you.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.320]   - You have a friction stir screwdriver, Andy?
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.640]   - I think if anything goes wrong with it,
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.040]   they just throw it away and give you nothing.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.200]   - I don't think you could fix that.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.040]   - I don't think you could fix that
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.240]   with a Sonic screwdriver.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.560]   - That's de-stir it.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.400]   - That's de-stir it.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.360]   - The 21 inch doesn't even open, right?
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.760]   Or you can't put a new hard driver.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.240]   - Oh, I'm sure not.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.520]   - However, you can with the bigger one.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.000]   - You could get a five millimeter edge edge edge glass
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.040]   LED backlit display with IPS technology,
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.240]   FaceTime HD camera, dual mics, four USB three ports,
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.920]   two Thunderbolt ports, mountain lion, Bluetooth four and more.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.760]   - And more.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.920]   - And more.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.760]   Or less.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.000]   - This is diaphone.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:55.840]   - Yes.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.560]   Actually, John came in, my studio manager said,
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.680]   you know, really, you should get one for your office.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.280]   'Cause the Mac kind of gets in the way, it's so thick.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.800]   (laughing)
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.240]   - Is it like an inch?
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.760]   - Think of only seeing,
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.480]   - You see Andy, you asked about fitness.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.320]   - Here it is, there.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.160]   - It's so thick.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.720]   - Leo's old iMac is so thick.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.280]   (laughing)
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   - For Americans, how does all of our devices
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.200]   keep on getting thin and we keep on getting thicker?
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.760]   - Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.920]   They always say, and of course it's thinner.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.160]   - That's top computer is the only consumer product
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.960]   that the corn industry has not figured out a way
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.520]   to get high for those corn serpent.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.360]   - There you go.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.180]   - You're working on it.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.680]   - This is a technique. - And a technique.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.960]   - Apple has added the Note 2 and a variety
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.800]   of other Samsung devices to the patent lawsuit.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.840]   Samsung says the iPhone couldn't exist
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.180]   without Samsung patents, so there.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.000]   - They make slot flights.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600]   I don't think they just make love to each other
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.800]   and end this dance.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.960]   - Well, that's what they did with HTC
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.040]   and Apple's redacting the amount of money.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.160]   Nobody wants to know what HTC is paying for phone.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.720]   - Apparently a trivial amount.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.080]   - Well, what could that be?
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.840]   A dollar, a nickel, $8, what is trivial?
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.440]   - HTC is not making a lot of profit
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.240]   and instead it's not gonna damage their profits.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.160]   - That's trivial.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.280]   - Doesn't sound like a lot.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.400]   - If you're not making any money.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.240]   - Yeah.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   - Although they did have to pay $276 million in fines
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.760]   or whatever, you know, what do you call that?
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.580]   Damages, damages is the word.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.240]   That's less than a billion.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:34.320]   Oh, there's a good thing on ARS Technica.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.840]   Before the new iTunes comes out,
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.920]   iTunes through the ages.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.520]   You can look go back if you wanna look
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   at the good old days, iTunes 1.0, 2.0.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.280]   By the way, the iTunes predates the iPod.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.120]   - Yep.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.960]   - So 2.0 supported the iPod.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.120]   - That's arguably what made the iPod work.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:53.960]   - Right.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.800]   - You know, just that you could suddenly
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.400]   talk about it. - Absolutely.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.400]   - iTunes 3 smart playlists,
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.140]   iTunes 4, the music store.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.080]   Still couldn't buy a CDC then.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.440]   - Do they have Soundjam in there before?
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.960]   - Soundjam, they should 'cause that's what it was based on,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.800]   right? - Yeah.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.560]   - They bought, Apple bought Soundjam
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.560]   and used that as the basis for iTunes.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.920]   Back in, when was that?
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.280]   January 2001.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:23.100]   And it put everybody else out of business.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.120]   You know, there was, besides Soundjam,
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.240]   there was another product I used to use
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   by a camera with the name of it.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.480]   It's long gone.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.160]   iTunes 5 supported the Nano and podcasts.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.280]   That was when our worlds changed in 2005.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.480]   - I can't believe it was that long girl.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.000]   - 2005, yeah.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.800]   - iTunes 6 music videos, iTunes 7 movies.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.600]   That was in September 2006.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.560]   iTunes 8 added Genius.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.400]   Do you use the Genius?
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.760]   - Never, never.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.480]   Genius ain't so smart really.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.000]   - Nice.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.120]   - I like things that you mix the very specific way.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.520]   - The different people in your family
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   buying stuff into one only Genius.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.400]   - Completely skews their results.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.240]   - Oh yeah, 'cause my son buys a lot of hip hop
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.480]   and then the Genius is confused by that.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.200]   - I keep getting on this Katy Perry.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.840]   (laughing)
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.920]   - He's probably saying the same thing.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.840]   My dad keeps buying Katy Perry stuff.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.120]   He's really screwing up my Genius recommendations.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.540]   iTunes 9 added sharing.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.760]   That's a nice feature.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   It's fun to go back through this and see what these are
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.440]   the big things that Apple was saying,
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.000]   "Hey, now we have sharing."
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.440]   Home sharing.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   iTunes 10.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.920]   Ping.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.000]   - Ping.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.600]   - Ping.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.800]   And then iTunes 11 is completely redesigned
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.320]   and we shall see it soon.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.160]   Minus Ping.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.440]   - Will there be a friendly Windows version
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.000]   with all those new fancy APIs wrapped up
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.360]   and ported over to Windows Land?
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.200]   - I don't know.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.000]   I feel bad because people really
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.680]   have a lot of trouble with iTunes on Windows.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.520]   And I'm sure it's the largest number of people
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.360]   using iTunes, right?
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.280]   It's Windows users.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.120]   Much more than that.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.120]   - It's so difficult.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:01.960]   I have to say my dad.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.320]   - Oh, good.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.760]   - My dad has it on his Windows.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.480]   And every time I go home, I have to fix something.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.560]   - And it turns people off of Apple too.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.160]   People never had any experience with Apple.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   That's what they know.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.680]   And I mean, we went to a party a few weeks ago
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.240]   and the first thing that I found out
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.080]   when I write something about Apple is like,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.600]   "Oh God, iTunes on Windows, I am."
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.360]   - Exactly.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.600]   - So they gotta work on that.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.920]   They gotta fix that.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.640]   - Not if you just buy a Mac, then it fixes itself.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.800]   - Yeah, right.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.120]   - I wish I could say that on the radio show.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.440]   When somebody calls and they say,
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.240]   "Yeah, I'm using iTunes on Windows and my heart falls.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.520]   I don't say anything, but I wish I could just say,
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.720]   "Oh, I'm so sorry."
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.320]   - I talked to someone on a play that said,
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.840]   "I had an iPhone, I love my iPhone,
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.640]   but I hated iTunes for Windows.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.360]   So the next computer I bought was just a Mac
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.520]   and then it works fine."
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.400]   - You know, it was like, you know,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   it was just having like a--
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.080]   - It's a fix.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:49.920]   - Yeah, exactly that.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.760]   - I'll acknowledge that.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.720]   - You guys use iTunes anymore?
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.440]   Because since iCloud, I don't think,
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.960]   unless I've had to do a complete restore,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.320]   I've never gone anywhere near iTunes.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.680]   - No, I try not to.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.520]   - I won't use a brand.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.360]   - I don't use a brand.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.040]   - I'm exactly the opposite.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.240]   If I could get iCloud to work predictably,
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.360]   then I would switch to it.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.600]   But as it is, it's the desktop is still the best way
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.120]   to create playlists, the best way to manage content
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.720]   on a device.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.960]   I keep trying to like iCloud syncing,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.880]   but it just will not behave.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.360]   - I guess 90% of my listening is all through Spotify,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.680]   so I don't think that's the other issue.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.600]   Is that I don't really listen to the songs there anymore.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.280]   - And a final story, according to Patently Apple,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.680]   the lightning trademark came from Harley Davidson.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.400]   - Wow.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.120]   - Yeah, and Apple bought it from him.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.800]   We found that out in the EU filings for lightning.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.840]   - Try that for like, how do you,
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.520]   how do you patent a lightning bolt?
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.480]   Seems like there's a lot of prior art,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.920]   that's all I'm saying.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.200]   - Well, Apple decided not to fight it.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.080]   - I think it was a trademark.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.360]   I think they had the rights to use the word lightning
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.000]   in certain areas across over with how Apple wanted
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.200]   to market the lightning connector,
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.680]   and they agreed to license those rights
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.360]   for specific use with the lightning connector.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.600]   - Amusement and game apparatus intended for use
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.880]   with an external display screen or monitor.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.320]   - How does Harley end up with that?
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.160]   - That's the other part of it is like,
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.520]   were they having a game apparatus on their bike?
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.360]   - Ah.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.160]   - I think it has to do with the assistive devices
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.840]   that their customers use after they crash
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   their motorcycles and lose their disabilities.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.280]   (laughing)
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.280]   - Well on that note, let's take a break and come back.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.720]   We got our picks of the week coming up
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.080]   and just a bit, Andy and Naco's here from the Chicago
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.360]   Sun Times, John Moltz from a pretty nice,
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.240]   a very nice website.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.320]   - Pretty nice website.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.160]   - It's pretty nice.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.640]   - Maybe it should be pretty nice.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.120]   - You know, I like to say a very nice website.com.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.200]   - Also, Irachi from ReneeMoor.com.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.760]   No, no, ReneeRitchie from iMoor.com.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.480]   If you should change your name legally to Irachi though.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.520]   - I was thinking of IraNay,
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.840]   but people kept saying Iraean in it.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.000]   - No, IraNay, yeah.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.480]   And the next time we have somebody named Iraean
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.760]   on I'll call her IraNay, we'll see what I--
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.720]   - But I did find out Leo that I took me years
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.800]   to realize that I have a Stanley name.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.360]   It was just a realization I had about a week ago.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.160]   - Oh, it's totally a Stanley name.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.560]   - Yeah.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.120]   - Do you work at the Daily Plano?
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.640]   No, that would be the wrong newspaper.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.600]   I would say the Daily Planet,
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.040]   the Daily Bugle, the Daily Bugle.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.680]   I would love to-- - IraR.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.520]   - ReneeRitchie.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.120]   Would you be a Villanor a Hero?
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.800]   Do Villanos get the double letter names?
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.440]   I think it's usually at the Picha Parker-Bruzjist
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.480]   or Hero app or all types.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.200]   - Pepper pots, you know, even the psychics
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.120]   get a little bit of names.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:34.960]   - Susan Storm.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.120]   - What about Leo LaPorte?
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:36.960]   See, that's not in there.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.800]   - Yep.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.640]   - No, you're there too, Leo.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.280]   We both have Stanley names.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.160]   - You better go.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.880]   - You have to get really good at boa.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.400]   (laughing)
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.080]   And Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.680]   show brought to you today by our friends at audibleaudible.com.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.080]   I had a 14-hour plane flight.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.560]   Two ways 'cause you have to go home after you go.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.600]   And if it weren't for audible,
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.840]   I don't know how it was survived there,
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.800]   but I listened to a lot of books,
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.280]   the new Pete Townsend biography, who I am.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:05.600]   I'm loving and really enjoy Mark Owens,
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.200]   no easy day, Seal Team Six story.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.960]   Wow, is that great?
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.040]   Wow.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.680]   This is the same team that God of some have been Lawton
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.720]   is the team that rescued the captain from the Alabama
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.600]   Merck captain who was captured by Somali pirates.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.840]   - Well, they're about the same guys.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.680]   They're like super cool.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.520]   - They've got some skill.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.680]   - My son said, "Now that's an alpha male."
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.480]   (laughing)
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.160]   Yes, smart, you know, physically vital,
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.440]   really a fun book, you just can't put it down.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.360]   That's called No Easy Day.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.680]   See, the reason I mention this is 'cause
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.600]   I'm gonna give you a free book
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.160]   and now the question is, well, what free book?
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.120]   Well, if you go to audible.com/MacBreak,
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.200]   you can sign up for the gold account.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.560]   That's a book, a month subscription.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.880]   Subscription is the way to go, by the way,
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.760]   the most affordable way to listen to Audible.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.480]   And your first month's free, your first credit is free.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   And you can cancel it anytime, pay nothing,
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.080]   but keep that book forever.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.240]   Audible is like the world's best bookstore of audiobooks.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.000]   Audible.com to browse around 100,000 plus titles
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.080]   in every category, everything from history.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.280]   If you saw the new Spielberg movie,
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.880]   Lincoln, it's based on a great Dareth Kearns,
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.760]   a Goodwin book called Team of Rivals,
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.960]   which I listened to on Audible and I loved it.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.400]   It's the story of how Lincoln put together,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.960]   you know, his cabinet from people
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.120]   who were political opponents and made it really work.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.000]   And this is what the book of the movie is based on.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.680]   Salmon, Chase, William Seward, Edward Bates.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.360]   Really, really interesting.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.920]   I feel like history, it's fantastic.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.280]   But also if you like spy novels, thrillers,
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.680]   what are you listening to these days, Andy?
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.440]   What do you like?
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.240]   I'm in the middle of a really fun book by Kevin Pollock
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.120]   called How I Slept My Way to the Middle,
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.880]   Secrets and Stories from Stage, Screen and Interwebs.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.600]   This was a pick based on two different things
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.320]   that I have become really obsessive
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.480]   with watching the usual suspects over and over and over again.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.920]   It's just, it kills me every single time.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.160]   And also, I'm a huge fan of his podcast
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.520]   and video podcast, Kevin Pollock's Chacho.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.200]   He is such a great interviewer, such a great wit.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.000]   And so he couldn't help but find,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.720]   but as he started plugging this book,
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.000]   which just came out a couple of weeks ago,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.440]   that okay, I'm willing to give him some of my money
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.840]   for his partial payment for some of the entertainment
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.320]   he's given me in the past.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.000]   And it's just full of, it's not like Stephen Topoloski's book
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.240]   where he's telling stories about, where the,
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.480]   Topoloski might tell you some stories
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.400]   about filming Groundhog Day,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.960]   but it's mostly about the experiences
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.520]   and the life lessons he had around it.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.720]   And that's wonderful, even though you're sort of like,
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.800]   but could you tell us some funny stories
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.400]   about Bill Murray from the set?
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.560]   (laughing)
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.800]   You know, this is sort of the opposite of that.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.960]   He doesn't really get into like, you know,
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.400]   life lessons or big stories.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.120]   It really is just a guy who's had a killer career
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.600]   as a stand with comedian, was one of Johnny Carson's
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.160]   favorite guests, had a, and one of those rare,
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.680]   I can't think of another actor who you could tell him,
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.040]   you could say that he was, he is a top drawer,
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.360]   A-list comedian, but also a top drawer A-list actor,
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.640]   where if you look at him in a few good men,
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.200]   if you look at him in the usual suspects,
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.400]   you would not say, oh, well, that's the guy who
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.440]   was a stand up comic and they managed to cast him
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.720]   in a few roles or similar to his on-state performer.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.400]   No, he is an absolutely wonderful actor.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.600]   So yeah, so it's just full of stories like that.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.480]   Right now, the story alone about how he came,
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.360]   his tactics for getting on the Tonight Show,
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.520]   just some of the gut-seous thinking,
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.600]   some of the gut-seous maneuvers you've ever heard.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.000]   And it's great 'cause you're listening to this
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.120]   in his own voice.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.080]   So you would think that this is the voice of a man
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.040]   who is looking back on his decision-making process,
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.160]   like at age 27, from the perspective of someone
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.840]   who's in his 50s, and saying, you idiot, why are you,
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.880]   don't say yes, Mr. Tal coordinator,
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.520]   I would love to be on the Tonight Show right now.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.920]   Don't, it's a fantastic story with end,
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.200]   which ends in huge success.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.720]   Right now, just this morning, I got to the part
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.480]   where he starts talking about being cast
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.120]   in the usual suspects.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.480]   And so this is just nothing but those,
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.840]   if you're familiar with his work,
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.480]   or if you just like Showbiz stories,
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.120]   it's just nothing but great story after great story,
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.920]   after great story, after great story.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.520]   With that sarcastic edge.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.880]   Let me play, I'll play a little bit of his voice
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.400]   'cause he'll recognize his voice.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.280]   And does he do any of his impressions there
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.120]   'cause he does the buzz?
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.720]   Oh yeah, well yeah, it's wonderful 'cause I got to the end
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.200]   of the section where he's talking about filming
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200]   a few good men.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.760]   So oftentimes, when you listen to an audiobook,
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.120]   like someone will say, and then I met Jack Nicholson,
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.280]   and then, and so Jack said to me, well Dave,
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.400]   I think that your car is, no, he will do
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.360]   a absolutely dead on-
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.160]   No, perfect impression of the guy.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.360]   His impressions are amazing.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:03.640]   He's the guy who does the great shatner.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:08.320]   He also does an amazing Christopher Walken,
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.160]   kind of the definitive Christopher Walken.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.400]   Are we not getting audio, maybe not?
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.040]   Nope, I live in Brooklyn.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.160]   How long to take you to?
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.680]   (laughing)
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.240]   The revolving stage that's conducive to almost nothing.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.440]   Still, it was a big part of my young life
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:26.240]   as witnessed by the infamous Dave Clark V autograph session.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.360]   Is he gonna, is he gonna talk about the Circle Star Theater
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.200]   in San Carlos?
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.040]   I bet he is.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.280]   Yeah, he grew up here.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.040]   Remember that revolving stage very well.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.040]   (laughing)
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:35.960]   Kevin, I love Kevin.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.400]   I've known him for quite a few years, not super well,
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.680]   but well enough to talk to.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.000]   And last time I saw him, he told me some good stories
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.200]   about the usual suspects.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.240]   He's a great guy.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.280]   Again, he is just, he is on that list
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.040]   where the next time he comes in New England,
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.640]   I just want, I want to buy a ticket to a show,
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.040]   even if I have a family wedding to go to that night.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.280]   A, because I will try to worm out of that wedding
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.560]   up until like the time I absolutely cannot
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560]   worm out of it.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.280]   And then even then I'll be pleased that, okay,
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.640]   at least I bought a ticket, at least I,
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.960]   in some direct or indirect fashion, caused him
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.000]   to be, get some money into his pocket
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.280]   because he's just fantastic.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.720]   We gotta get him since his book came out.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.960]   Let's get him on, on triangulation.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.120]   I'd love to get him on.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:15.960]   Anyway.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:19.360]   Oh, and last comment, he is upset about the Photoshop job
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.160]   they did on his face on the cover of the book.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.000]   He does, he did mention it.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.960]   It's the worst cover I have ever seen.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.480]   He mentioned, he mentioned that in the chat show
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:29.360]   that he approved the cover, and then they made the chat show
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.720]   that changes to make him look like a,
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:36.440]   make him look substantially not like a.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.680]   Who is that?
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.520]   I have no idea.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.080]   And it's just a bizarre cover.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.120]   He looks like his parents immigrated
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.160]   from a different part of the planet than,
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.080]   if it were, in fact, this planet,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.120]   then they actually immigrated from it.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.680]   How I slept my way to the middle, Kevin Pollock.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   That's just one of a hundred thousand titles.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.880]   That one could be yours for free.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.240]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.160]   And even if you're already an audible member,
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.040]   just a reminder, the Sanderson book is still available

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.160]   It's the great novella legion.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.080]   I really love it.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.880]   Oliver Wyman narrates it.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.560]   I've really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.000]   And it's free to everybody.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.360]   So just, you know, even if you just wanna say,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.040]   I wanna hear what it's like.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.040]   audible.com/sanderson, S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.960]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.160]   Let me start with you, Alex Lindsey,
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.880]   'cause you're sitting right here.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   So I finally bought a nest.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   Oh, I love it.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.880]   Did you get the nest one?
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   That's like a new nest.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   I got the new one.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.880]   The nest one, I was like, but I heard there were rumors
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.440]   that was gonna come out, and so I finally decided
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.880]   I was gonna give it a shot.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.880]   And so I went and bought the new nest.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880]   It's a thermostat.
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.600]   Let me tell you how much I have a back house
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.680]   that is my office, and then the front house,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.880]   which is the family.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.280]   And to tell you how much I love my family,
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.280]   I put it in the front house.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   Oh, you do.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   I'm a back house.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   This is Tony Fidel design that's the guy to the iPod.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   So what's interesting is that I took them up on their challenge.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:07.280]   I'm not gonna hire someone to put this in.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.280]   I'm going to, I was gonna install it myself.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.280]   So I took that horrible honey well that I hate.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.280]   Like I just, I hate the thermostat in our house.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.280]   This is why I did this, was because I hate it so much.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.280]   You know, it's constantly turning the thing off,
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   on and off at the wrong time.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.280]   So anyway, so I took it off, and you pull it off,
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   pull the front cover off.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   You don't even realize how these things work.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.280]   You pull the front cover off, and the little piece comes with this little,
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.280]   little pieces of tape, little stickers that you put on each.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.280]   Isn't that great on the wires?
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.280]   So before you take off, so it says before you do that,
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.280]   you read the instructions.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   Label the wires.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280]   Label the wires.
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280]   You know what you're, you're connecting.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.280]   So I labeled all the wires, and then I unscrewed the thing,
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.280]   and then I put the, I put the nest on, and then I screwed it.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.280]   You know, I just, and you didn't screw it,
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.280]   and it just popped them, popped the little wires.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   So we see.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.280]   And then I, yeah, pop the top on, and I ran it up, you know,
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.280]   I connected it to my wifi, and it's connected to number one.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.280]   Any thermostat that's connected to your wifi is instantly cooler
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   than the other thermostats.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.280]   But, but the, so I connected to the wifi, and, and I've set it up with my phone,
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280]   so I can see, you know, and connect it, you know,
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280]   - They have apps for every phone.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   - So you have the entire process of, from the time that I opened the box
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   to the time that I had it running was about 18 minutes.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.280]   By myself, without, and it was 18 minutes, because I actually timed it,
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   because I wanted to see.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.280]   So I was a little in pressure.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.280]   I was focused.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.280]   My wifi talked to me.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.280]   I'm like, I'm working here.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.280]   I gotta get the, don't bother me.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.280]   So anyway, so I was focused at focused 18 minutes, but, but I literally did the updates.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.280]   I had it running.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:34.280]   And so then once you have it, you know, what's great is you walk near it,
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   and it turns on.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.280]   Like you, like you walk by it, and it goes, "Sense is your presence."
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.280]   - Yeah, I'm here, you know, and, and so you, and you can tell it that, you know,
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   that you're going away, that you're here, you can do that on your iPhone,
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.280]   from a distance, so on, when you're on your way back, you can say,
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   "Hey, I'm coming back."
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Just go ahead and turn that heater on.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.280]   And anyway, and then it's also starting to pay attention to when, you know, when the phone is,
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.280]   it's still learning, but eventually I'll be able to do that.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:05.280]   But it's so easy, and it literally, that I know this sounds crazy,
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.280]   but the house is actually in a better temperature now, now that it's actually running.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   - It saves you energy.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.280]   - Yeah.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   - And it does some things.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   There's some smart things it does.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.280]   For instance, it knows your AC.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   If you, it will work with AC and heating.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280]   I don't have any.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   I don't have any idea about how you want to, yeah, but you also tell it like what kind of heater you're using,
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.280]   and it figures out.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   - It will keep the fan going after the compressor's off so that it continues to,
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   I mean, there's just a lot of smart things about it, and I love it that I, in fact,
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.280]   let me log into my nest.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.280]   Hold on, I get to log into it.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.280]   - And I have to say that I am now thinking that this is the, you know,
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   the Trojan horse for home automation.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   - I feel like it's got to be more.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.280]   - I feel like if they, you know, it feels like the next thing they're going to do is,
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   because I just know that I've been really looking for home automation software.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Like, what am I going to run the whole house with?
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.280]   All the locks, all the, and part of why I'm holding out now is because the experience with
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.280]   nest is so good that when I look at all the other options, I kind of feel like,
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.280]   I just want to see if these guys, I want to wait another couple months to CES and see if these guys like
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.280]   roll out what I think they should roll out next with is all the other automation stuff.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.280]   The locks from my door.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.280]   - I'm curious if they do that.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.280]   - Line controls, everything else.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   - I mean, it's expensive.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.280]   It's 250 bucks.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.280]   It's not cheap.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.280]   I don't know what, I don't know what the Honeywell costs.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   - Probably the last 60 dollars.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   - Yeah.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.280]   - So it's a lot more expensive.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   - But you can go online, you can use a smartphone app and it knows what the weather is locally.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.280]   So for instance, it knows it's 61 degrees right now and it adjusts accordingly.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.280]   But right now it's turned off, you see, but if I say, "Hey, I'm going to come home,
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.280]   I could turn up the heat."
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.280]   This is turning on the heat of my house right now on the web.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.280]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.280]   And there's more you can do, you can say, "I'm away."
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.280]   Let me turn it down.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.280]   That goes, "I'm not there."
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280]   It's really sweet.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.280]   It's a gadget.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.280]   - I don't know if you really need it, but I like it.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.280]   - I thought the first one, I have to admit, the first one I was a little afraid of what
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.280]   I was going to install it.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.280]   - It's all second wonderful.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   - And easy, the install, I'll second you on this.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   The only, most thermostats are low power so you can't shock yourself.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   But do check if you have a 110 or 220 volt thermostat.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:13.280]   You might want to check and get an electrician to do it.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   - That was the scariest part of the whole thing was, is that it's wires.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.280]   - It does tell you to turn off the power, which I have to go outside for.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   And opening up my power, you can tell, like, that was the time I had to do it.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   I'm traveling so much that I went home.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   And it was raining, and I was probably not one of the hardest things ever.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.280]   - It's low power, it's actually.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   - Yeah, but no, but I was turning off the circuit breaker outside.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.280]   - And the rain, it wasn't raining very hard.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.280]   - What could possibly go wrong.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280]   - I'm still here.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280]   - I'm still here.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   - Nest.com.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   And I saw that they were selling in Black Friday specials at one of the home improvement places,
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   the old Nest.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   So look carefully.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:50.280]   Because I think you want the new one.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   - You want the new one.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.280]   I think the new one was a big jump forward.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.280]   So I would definitely get the new one.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.280]   - Renee Richie, a pick of the week from you.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:02.280]   - I have, Pat and Quill makes these handmade cases for iPhones and iPads.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   - Ooh, that's pretty.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.280]   - And they have just put out their new iPhone 5 version of the little pocket book.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   Complete with a little wall.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.280]   - I got to upside down.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.280]   - It's wood.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   - Yeah, it's made out of birch and Italian leather, I believe.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   And they've got the iPad mini ones now, Leo.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   So if that smart cover is driving you out of your mind.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.280]   - Take a red up.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.280]   - Porn novel called "Burch and Italian Leather."
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.280]   I'm maybe wrong, but it sounds amazing.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   - Is there something--
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.280]   - 50 shades of rich Italian leather.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.280]   - Yeah.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   - They're a little hipster.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.280]   But there's something nice about swathing the latest in apple aluminum and glass with something
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:41.280]   that's old world and hand bound and easy to tuck under your arm and take out without a bag or something.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.280]   - So there was the bamboo one that was called, what was that called?
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280]   - They're both--
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.280]   - Yeah, so the little pocket book is the one for the iPhone 5.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   - Right.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.280]   - But there's three companies that make things like this.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   I mean, I really like these hard cases.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.280]   I have the exhibit case, but the first one, I can't remember the name of it anyway.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   - There's dodo cases.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.280]   - Dodo.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.280]   - Yeah, how does it use compared to the dodo?
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   - The basic ones are almost identical.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   What I like about padding quill is they have other models, for example.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   I think it's called the Contega, where you can actually fold it up the way you do a smart cover.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   And it has a little pocket for paper.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.280]   And it's got a little bit of extra functionality that I find really nice.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   - I'm gonna get something for my mini, because I got the apple smart cover,
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   as we were talking about before the show began.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.280]   It's just not-- it's dumb.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.280]   - It's not smart.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.280]   - Yeah, but these are pretty of these minis.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.280]   And it's handcrafted in mini-apples.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   - Yes.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:29.280]   - So that's good.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.280]   The gradual-- these are pretty.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   - So which one do you have?
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.280]   - The brand new one for the iPad mini.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.280]   I think it's the graduate for the mini.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.280]   - There's a graduate artist, the graduate edition, and the octavo.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   - Yeah, the more expensive ones have more features,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   the ability to fold them up or extra pockets or stuff.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   So it just depends on what you need.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   - Pad and quill.com.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280]   - Yes.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   - Mr. Moltz, a pick from you, sir.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   - My pick is boom for the Mac.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   - Boom!
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.280]   - I switched from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Air back in June,
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.280]   I believe.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.280]   And my son and I have this tradition when my wife goes out
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.280]   that we sit around the table and we eat hot dogs and watch,
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.280]   like a movie or a TV show on my laptop.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.280]   And with the air, it's hard to hear because the speakers are just
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.280]   quieter than on the MacBook Pro.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.280]   Well, boom, changes that and somehow manages-- and I don't know
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   if this is good for the device or not,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.280]   but I found it to be very useful because it will actually
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   increase the sound output of your MacBook's speakers,
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   or any speakers, actually, any Mac speakers.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   And it allows me to increase it to the point where you can
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.280]   actually hear what's going on while we're sitting there chewing
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.280]   on hot dogs and watching a show.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   - Totally, totally works.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   - It's only $7 from the Mac App Store.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.280]   - It includes an equalizer too, right?
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   - That's nice.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.280]   - Yeah.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.280]   Boom, bada-bing, bada-boom.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.280]   - And it was something that Steve Jobs always said.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   - Boom!
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.280]   - Boom.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   Boom, boom.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.280]   - And I, co, your pick of the week.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   - This is going to be one that's, oh goodness, I'm pixelated
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280]   again, I'm so sorry about that.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.280]   - Sorry, it's just a band.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   It's nothing you can do about it.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.280]   Just a big open system band.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]   - It's Chinatown.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   - It's Chinatown.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.280]   - It's a Chinatown.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.280]   - It's a big-- it's bandwidth, though.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.280]   This is going to be a really cool pick for people of a certain age.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   This is a Charlie Brown Christmas as an iPad app.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280]   - Oh, wow.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.280]   - And you start off with-- see if we can get the audio to come through.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   - [SINGING]
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   - This is just like the background music to it.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   As you can see, there's like a little record player with a 45 RPM record.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.280]   - That's funny.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   - There's one instance in which I'm willing to support skeuomorphism
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   because that's perfect.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   - Oh, yeah, that's cute.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.280]   - [SINGING]
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   - Charlie Brown Christmas time was here.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   - It's being-- and it's being read by the same actor who voiced Charlie Brown
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.280]   as a kid for the actual special.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.280]   - Wow.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.280]   - And after-- and you can read along, but after the end of it,
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.280]   you can like touch things and there's animation.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   And it's like this, like there's a-- if you touch on the snowflakes,
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   they turn into like big snowflakes.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.280]   It's a read along.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.280]   There's also a really good side effect that actually makes it a good business expense.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.280]   Because I bought this this morning after remembering that someone really cool
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.280]   had recommended it to me last week.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.280]   And so I just have this open while I'm like reading and working.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   And as you can hear, like the Vince Garaldi soundtrack is just on a loop.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   - Oh.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   - And it's just such a pleasant thing to like have in the background as you're working.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.280]   - Yeah.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.280]   - My favorite business music.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.280]   It just puts you in this warm, happy, you're five years old, you're lying,
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   you're lying on your belly on the carpet in your parents living room,
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.280]   watching the Charlie Brown special, wondering if you'll, you know,
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.280]   wonder what a little Debbie's snack cake would taste like if you would have one.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.280]   It's-- anyway, $2.99.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.280]   It was probably one of the happiest $2.99 I've ever spent.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   And also, I mean, there's not just-- there's more to it than this.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:14.280]   Every single page has another-- has a different kind of game or pleasant tree.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.280]   - It's the original soundtrack in the background, though, right?
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.280]   - Right, exactly.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.280]   But, you just-- I'm sorry, you were riding me as you were going through their places
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.280]   where you can play the piano during the party scene.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:27.280]   - Anyway.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.280]   - You can learn how to play the Linus and Lucy theme for your very own self.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.280]   - Yes.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280]   - Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.280]   - Yeah.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.280]   Anyway, it was a very pleasure inducing $2.99.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.280]   - I think Sara picked-- it's a great pumpkin.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.280]   It's the great pumpkin, Charlie Brown, is also an app, right?
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.280]   - Oh.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280]   - Didn't know that.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.280]   - Yeah.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   So I guess they're gonna do the whole thing.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280]   That's great.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   - Charles Schultz Estates still doing okay.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.280]   I still make it a lot of years there.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.280]   - It was actually his 90th birthday, or 90th anniversary of his birth just this week.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.280]   - You know, he was a local.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   He was up the road a piece in Santa Rosa, and there's the Charlie Brown Museum is there,
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.280]   and the skating rink there is the Charles Schultz Museum.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   - I know there was a Charlie Brown Museum.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.280]   - Take the kids.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.280]   - No, I visited-- I decided to go to visit the place.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.280]   I did go and visit while-- before-- while it was still the studio.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:18.280]   And even that was just cool enough to see, oh, there's--
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:19.280]   - There's-- there's--
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.280]   - Oh, it's rare.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.280]   - And what a pilgrimage, 'cause Charles Schultz is still like the inspiration for anybody
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.280]   who ever even considered complaining about having to write a column sometime in the next 48 hours.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:34.280]   This guy who lived until he was 70 years old, wrote, drew, inked, and published a comic strip
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.280]   every day of his life and didn't miss a single deadline.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.280]   - Day.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.280]   - Don't complain.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.280]   - Every day.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.280]   - You know, I'm glad there's stuff like this, which will-- I hope keep it alive for another
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:48.280]   generation, 'cause a lot of times what happens to comic strips is they just don't, you know,
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.280]   they're-- once they're done, they're done.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280]   - No, we don't.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.280]   - And there are a few, like, you know, Bloom County--
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.280]   - Calvin and Hobbes.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.280]   - Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, who really should live forever, I think.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.280]   You know, they're just great Dunsbury.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280]   Just great stuff.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   And credit to Vince Garaldi, who's the piano guy on all of that stuff.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.280]   - Right.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.280]   - His music is fantastic.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280]   - Good pick.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.280]   - Thank you, Andy.
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280]   What a great show this was.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   Andy Inacos with the Chicago Sun Times joins us every week with his Balelica.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.280]   - That's the ukulele, but I--
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.280]   - Thank you for making my Fluke ukulele tax deductible.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.280]   (laughter)
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   - Perhaps the Fluke ukulele company would like to get in touch with me about perhaps having
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.280]   some other-- of their fine instruments like their new banjo.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.280]   - Candy Doolay!
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.280]   - Candy Doolay!
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.280]   - His position.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280]   - The Balelica!
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   Oh, can he play?
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.280]   - Like all Russians.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   - Little Russians, just like famous Gritaras have their little flick, Mr.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   Renatko's ukulele's are provided by the Fluke ukulele company.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   - I think we could do that.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.280]   - Mr. Renatko plays Fluke ukulele exclusively.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   - We will add, just for that, we'll add roll closing credits.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.280]   We haven't had closing credits on the show until now, but from now on.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   (laughter)
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.280]   - Just buy HEGA.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.280]   - One line.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280]   - Yeah, one line.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:09.280]   - Leo's wardrobe by Botany500.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.280]   - Exactly.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   - Guests of Mac Breakweedly.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   Stay in Leo's backyard.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280]   (laughter)
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:23.280]   We also thank John Moltz from a very nice website, which happens to be called verynicewebsite.com
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.280]   or .net.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   Nice to have you.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   - Thank you very much.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.280]   - Yeah, you're great.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.280]   - I love Lee, I love you to be here again.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:34.280]   - Yeah, I don't know where we dug your name up, but thank you, Chad, for finding John and
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.280]   bringing him back.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.280]   It's been a long time and I always love having you on, so we'll get you on more.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.280]   Renee Ritchie from iMoor.com, great to have you as always.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.280]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.280]   Thank you.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.280]   Welcome back again.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280]   - And thank you, I'm glad to be back.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   I actually was, by the end of the trip, I was doing shows in my underwear and the cabin.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   I introduced you all and talked to the TV.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   It was great.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:01.280]   Alex Lindsay also here from pixelcore.com.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:03.280]   We do Mac Breakweedly.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.280]   11 a.m.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:05.280]   Pacific 2 p.m.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.280]   Eastern time every Tuesday, right before the Apple announcement.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.280]   - Each week.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.280]   - Yes.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   - And you can join us live, if you would.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:15.280]   It's great because with the chatroom, and as you can see, we refer to the chatroom because
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.280]   it's a great resource for us.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.280]   That's the funny thing, to go three weeks without having people tell me stuff.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.280]   I didn't, I would, they would say, "What would you like for breakfast?"
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   I said, "Chatroom."
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   And then there's no chatroom, I couldn't.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.280]   It was very difficult.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   - You need Google glasses for that?
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.960]   - That's what I would use Google glasses for is the chatroom because I literally, we have
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.520]   this all the time in front of us.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.560]   And you get hooked on having people tell you stuff.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.560]   So thank you chatroom.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.640]   If you join us live, you get to be part of that.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:50.920]   The chatroom is, I should mention the URL, although it is on our website, irc.twit.tv.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.200]   If you don't get to watch live though, you can always download on-demand versions, audio
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.320]   and video available after the fact of Twit.tv takes us a little time to get it edited and
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.800]   encoded, but usually by this afternoon, by Tuesday afternoon, you'll get a copy of Mac
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.800]   Break Weekly.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.160]   If in fact, if you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.200]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:12.200]   Now you better get back to work because Break Time is over.
