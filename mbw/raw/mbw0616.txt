[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   Hello, good to see you. Secret is I'm always angry. Oh
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.920]   You're not you're the sweetest guy in showbiz. Thank you. I usually I say things like that just to provoke compliments
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.640]   He's very good at it Renee Richie is also here from i'm more calm. Hello Renee
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.120]   Hello Leo. I have not slept since public beta. So excuse me if I just stare at we are in public beta land
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.280]   And also from and we're talking about that in a second also from the pixel core Alex Lindsey
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.880]   Hello, hello in studio on you brought Malachi and Isabella. They're hidden back there. Where are they?
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   Hey kids kid. Oh, they're they're running the board
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   On the show that's nice. No, they're on the tricaster today
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.840]   They're resetting the blade server saying you know what you get a lot more bandwidth if you just take this this cash
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920]   I'm moving on to this system. You know you can move your seats. Can you see your dad anyway?
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.100]   You're actually inventing VR warping. They have it. They have a bad the bad seats. They have this the obscure
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.240]   obstructed view on seats. Well, we'll get them better a better seat
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.560]   Yeah, Renee
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.180]   Did Mojave public beta ship today because yesterday before the show right before the show
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.200]   Dagnabbit, I guess I'll be downloading that
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.220]   yesterday the public beta of iOS 12
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.920]   shipped
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.800]   So before we start singing either of their praises the requisite
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:06.660]   I would say if yeah, you got to be careful, especially if you need GPS
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.680]   Yes, stopped working in the iOS not that it doesn't work. It's unreliable
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.620]   Have you noticed that Renee? I have not had that problem. However, I believe since iPhone 10 and iPhone 8
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.100]   Apple is much more aggressively power managing it and if things go wrong the GPS goes
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.340]   wonky so I've heard a lot of people complain about it. It knows where I am it
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.840]   Yeah, it thinks I live like now after the public beta install
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.800]   It feels like it thinks that I'm living a couple miles from my house. Oh, that's not good a privacy feature
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.340]   I've had a couple of I like that a couple of timeouts where it just sat there and
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.420]   Responsive that the first thing it happened when it rebooted
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.020]   It sat in response it for a little bit, but then it came back
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.900]   I've had it looks like a couple of re springs so it is it's a beta. It's a pre release for
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   iOS 12
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.380]   I have it on my iPad and I put it on another one of my iPhones the iPhone is actually probably less reliable
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.380]   Probably because there are so many more radios involved
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.340]   But it's stable ish on the iPad. So I
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.940]   Don't know if you're not if you're not a daily driver
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.260]   It's important my iPad is an essential part of my lifestyle sort of person
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.620]   I'd risk the public beta, but definitely not phone because I will say that overall overall. It's heck of a lot of fun
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.720]   So yeah, well, I don't know we're doing the stop. Don't do it first
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.580]   Yes
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.900]   I'm pointing out my experiences on the iPad just so that when they open they hear me say
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.460]   For God's unless you unless you're never in a position where your iPhone needs you need your iPhone to hail a halo car
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.100]   Make a payment make a phone call receive a phone call or a text know where you are
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.380]   I mean if you if you just use it as a music player your iPhone great. I go ahead take the risk the issue actually
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.000]   About putting on the iPad is that you don't get the mamojis. Yes, they are true depth only
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.780]   Amazing and so you need an iPhone 10 to do and it's work poor Megan put it on her 6s
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.300]   And she can't do them emoji. So let me just run through the mamoji a little bit
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.500]   Because this is the awesomest thing, you know, you know, now
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.660]   This is this is stupid. Tell me if I'm not doing this right because I think you have to launch messages to do it, right?
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.100]   You can edit it in messages. Yeah
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.460]   If you want to create a mamoji you go to messages and then you know, you go where you would add an
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.620]   Animoji but you can there'll be a plus sign
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.620]   That says new mamoji now. What's nice is you can create multiple mamojis. I have a couple
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.260]   But let's let's create a new one real quick. So just give you the idea of the process
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.980]   It I immediately posed for it and then I realized oh, it's not looking at me
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.420]   It is it's not a picture. You're just gonna say well. This is what I look like for some character creator. Yeah, choose the skin color
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.820]   And the freckles I
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.500]   Have no freckles hair style
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.820]   Now I was good, you know, I said on I would say here's the ladies hairs. No, no, we're not there's gender neutral here
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.980]   So I'm gonna have cornrows today
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.580]   head shape
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.020]   Round no matter what you do you're gonna look like a baby
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.060]   There's so the age options are annoying for me because they're basically three-year-old five-year-old and seven-year-old
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.820]   That's what you get, you know, you don't get a lot of choices
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.700]   It isn't designed to look like you it's designed to look like you get a real you get a lot of you get a real real house wise of
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:39.700]   California look for the absolutely plastic smooth skin and only there's more range of facial expression in the eyebrows
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.860]   So that's what I suspect is people will try less to make it look like them and
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.900]   Maybe create a character, right that they might want to be what they feel like not exactly
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.220]   But not necessarily what they look on because you could make many of them you can you can totally do that
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.620]   You can duplicate yours to an ad hats and I can make variants for your right. That's right. That's right exactly
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.620]   I liked having the hipster
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.420]   So there we go. I've got a little kangal. I'm not such good coffee service
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.620]   And and of course the first thing I did was stick out my tongue
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:20.140]   You've done all this for me. Yeah, it's binary right now. You can't do tongue gymnastics. It's an in-out state only right now
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.140]   There's no tongue tracking. Oh, you're right
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.500]   It's just in a room. You're gonna sell like a dog this morning
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.460]   Now the one more oh look I like that. That's the Amanda Connor version
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.300]   I think as you get it more this is more advanced emoji in what me emoji
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.420]   Yes, you decide. Oh, it doesn't have to look like me one other tip if you want to do it in video
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.260]   You go to video and then obviously reverse and then tap the star
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.180]   Which is a new feature in the video and now you can choose a me emoji among other things
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.060]   You could also do it in FaceTime and then you get this really weird effect where it's you on
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.380]   Your body in your setting
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.740]   Which is really weird and the other thing it took me a while to figure out Renee is well
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.740]   How do I get to the camera from here? You press that little X?
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.580]   Yeah, now you're in the camera and I can record
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.540]   something
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.300]   Hey, baby's welcome to Mac wake wiggly
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.500]   And now I have that now can I save that?
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.940]   You can send it. I can send it. I think sending and then say yeah
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.700]   So you have to send it to somebody where you can send it
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.500]   Well, that's a is that a share and then you just share it to your photos and by the way when I do edit I
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.140]   Don't have them emoji in here anymore, which is kind of a bummer. So you you kind of have to send it
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.860]   Now unfortunately I've poor Megan has been getting all my emojis
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.220]   Because that's I couldn't figure out. Oh, and here's the new
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:52.780]   Emote emoji me. What are they you can also add AR stickers Leo so that you can for example enjoy a tasty
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.140]   Tim Tim Hortons beverage yummy yummy yum. Well, you're that looks like Tim Cook
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.240]   You have and they actually the link to anchor points
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.380]   So if you move around the straw for example will stay in your mouth. That's cool
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.540]   Dog will stay on your shoulder. That's really cool, and you can use it in FaceTime
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:12.740]   Yeah, I think I think are are we all kind of over the an emojis now that we have them emojis. Yes
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.980]   The t-rex is kind of cool though. I still like the new t-rex
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.740]   Why wouldn't you want to be you or something like you? I know I I
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.920]   The character. Yeah, I think that the the me mojis have taken over the an emojis. Yeah
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.940]   Like Tim Cook during the announcement if you look carefully
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.780]   There was a tiger in the top corner and then at the last second you switch to Tim Cook and then they introduced him funny
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:42.460]   So you can do that as the epic reveal. That's hysterical to me though the really and I am really thrilled about this
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.740]   Most exciting thing. I mean there's do not you know the new screen time and all that stuff which works
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:54.980]   Stack notifications. That's awesome. Yeah, but to me the biggest most exciting part series shortcuts, baby
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.700]   If you go to series and search
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.300]   Now first I thought oh, it's gonna be all canned, but no it's been watching what I've been doing and
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.140]   so
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.820]   I'm able to create shortcuts because it's keeping an eye on things that have happened
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.820]   So for instance, I went to my wallet opened up my American Express card and then I
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.900]   Was able to make a shortcut. So when I say
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.980]   MX
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.340]   My wallet, oh, I don't have a I don't have it on here
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.060]   It's only on the phone, but my wallet will open up. Yeah, by the way, I created that on the phone
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:35.540]   But it did propagate to my iPad. So your shortcuts will go to all your iOS devices. You ask your whole plot for it now
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.020]   We'll see what it does. Oh my god. What would it do? That'll be interesting. I just say can't you if I can't do amex on here
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.380]   Let's let's try it here on my phone and we'll see so
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   MX oh
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.620]   Yeah, I did it launch my MX card
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.620]   Don't worry. There's no there's only I probably shouldn't show my even my four digits
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.300]   But that but that's really cool. It launched the American Express card from the wallet
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.340]   And I notice you have workflow install Leo
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.620]   So you can make workflows go to the workflow app then go to series shortcut settings and sign shortcuts to the workflow app before you get the shortcuts
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:14.980]   Isn't that interesting so but that means you really have now unlimited capabilities because you can you can launch workflow
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:22.220]   Create a workflow and then have it be a series add your the workflow app will actually be will just be renamed shortcuts when it's ready to ship
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.980]   Yeah, so all that'll still be there working for you. Have they added capabilities to workflow?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.540]   No, I think they're keeping workflow fairly static now so that it's it works the way you're familiar with it
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.020]   And they're adding the voice layer to it
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.220]   But it does it does get a lot of benefits by being Apple technology now
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.820]   So for example for years people would just they wanted workflow to work in the background like a system app now
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.660]   It can so you're basically getting voice activated background running workflows anytime you want them Wow
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.500]   And that's a that's a huge order of magnitude power user improvement
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:55.940]   That's why I was saying that that on the iPad where there isn't a whole lot of downside in
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.340]   Losing losing a feature that could is that could threaten your life at some point
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.900]   Workflows is not only a really huge time saver, but also I think that when it launches
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.020]   It's gonna take about a month and a half for you to for the for the system to have automatically built up a library of the most
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.940]   Kick but workflows for you automatically the stuff that you're gonna really rely on and why not get started on that?
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.700]   So that you can hit the ground running when the real thing gets released in September. I
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.500]   Have just really stoked about this to me. This is
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.700]   This is actually a lot of what Apple does
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.900]   Is kind of adding features to the iPhone that others had or apps had like the measure app
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.020]   Me mojis is unique. I don't think I mean, but there's been bit moji. So it's not fully unique
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:48.860]   There is and there is there is some automation capability on Android. There's Tasker, but it is much more fidgety and complicated
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:55.300]   Siri shortcuts to me is an actual breakthrough in how you use your device. I'm very excited about it
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.820]   Again, I think I talked about this last week
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.740]   But I think that's what Apple does more that's their main innovation is they get things out of the way
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.660]   You know, they get you know that they get it so that you're actually more likely to use it
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.340]   It doesn't mean that they always get it right, but there's still a lot of complicated things
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.340]   But I think that there is a
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.180]   Often they are they're taking something that we've already seen work over and over again
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.740]   And then they're just carving away some of the stuff that gets in between us and action
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.260]   And I think this is gonna be exciting. I think it's huge
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.620]   Especially as you start tying it into Internet of Things like this is you know
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.460]   I'm gonna use all your home kit stuff will work with this too, right? And as you pointed out Renee
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.460]   HomePod also will get these shortcuts. Yeah, I'm pod Apple watch has him in the series shortcut
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:41.300]   I was talking to Brian Romley who's a big voice first advocate this week and he was he's gonna use it like it's basically hypercard for voice
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   Wow, it's gonna be his new basic programming language
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.580]   I think that's where a lot of people are gonna have a lot of introduction and he'll do that he'll use workflow
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.940]   Yeah, it's gonna become the shortcuts app
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.820]   There'll be a gallery of it you can go through and add stuff you can add things to it
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.660]   You can take things out you can and it's gonna be accessible to people in a way that things haven't been since since
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.820]   Like the hypercardier. I love the idea that you can make home pod more useful. Yeah, cuz it's really not very useful
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.660]   You're essentially instead of adding all this this was like I think an internal debate in Apple
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.820]   Like do they just add a ton of skills like Alexa did and then you have you go through lists and add them
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.820]   Or do they base it on the apps you've already got because that's a good indicator of the functionality you want and it creates a much more manageable
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:26.420]   subset of skills for you to start with and they chose that approach so now you download apps and as you use them all these skills will sort of
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.340]   Propagate and then you can weave them together whatever whichever way you want with workflow
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.820]   And it's always a manageable list that you can sort of dip your toe into step-by-step
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.980]   Yeah, what I think that it makes this really such a solid feature is that this isn't something
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.300]   Yes, you can string together your own workflows
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:48.020]   But kind of like how nice the like the the the assistant is in Google photos where you didn't know that this
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.260]   The space they make decisions on its own saying hey look we came up with this really cool collage
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.940]   based on your trip to
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.980]   To Ellis Island last weekend do if you want to press this button and you can add it to your library
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:06.420]   Otherwise, we'll forget this all happened the idea of just having this little pain where you don't have to learn how to create workflows
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.860]   You don't even have to be aware that this feature exists
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:14.820]   It's just that there will be this magical box that that elves sometimes filled with really cool shortcuts
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.780]   Customized your daily flow and like to do is simply say hey, that's really useful. Why don't you let me use that?
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.940]   Use that on a permanent basis. That's how you get power into the hands of people that are using a
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.160]   Phone or a computer like an appliance as opposed to like a productivity tool
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.740]   Something that they have to learn how to use that's the most amazing thing about this for me is it covers such a broad spectrum
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   You will have the background workflow voice triggers for the nerdiest of nerds
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.940]   But for people who are just they've never felt computers were accessible
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.660]   They'll get a little indicator on their home screen saying do you want your usual coffee order?
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.060]   And it'll save them having to literally spallunk through like I don't know where's the app?
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.220]   There's where's though. Here's a list of things I can order there it is and it saves them so much interface action that it'll just
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.860]   It's push interface again like don't push interface
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.580]   You don't have to go find the things you want the things you want come to you
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.100]   Did they add did the
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.780]   Did I the new iOS add the when the reminder that tells you when to leave for your meeting?
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.620]   Yes
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.220]   That was it's your late it'll text like it'll say text Alex talking about running late for my meeting
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.860]   Well, the funny thing was is that I got I got a message
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.380]   I got a message after I installed it said it said you know the alarm went off and said your meeting is at
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.380]   At this time and I was like why is it giving me the alarm?
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.940]   50 minutes before 50 or 52 minutes knows how long it takes Alex turns out that I should have left right
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:44.580]   Here's the crazy thing based on the traffic right because normally it was only 35 minutes away
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.140]   Right, but it was 52 minutes that day. It sent me an alarm. You need to go now
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.740]   I should point out that Android has done this for some time
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.740]   I know but however
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.260]   It is a great feature what Android doesn't do is say and would you like to text right?
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.780]   You're a tell you options like if it's our phone number
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.180]   I'll say would you like to just call into the meeting because you won't get there on time or do you like to text?
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.780]   Yeah, yeah, I would like to see this is good
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:12.820]   This really doesn't indicate the sophistication of it when like and what what else is talking about is such a great indicator of how our
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:20.860]   Relationship with our technology is changing where I've I've had that situation with the ways app so many times where when I was
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:26.620]   For the first couple of years maybe three years if it told me to do something take a cockamade
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.860]   Trust it never never they were used before I would say oh god
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.420]   What do you think about ways and I would just take my normal route now say I don't know why you're telling me to
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:41.060]   For God's they've got off I-95 right now. Yeah, I'm certainly going to trust that that I'm gonna believe in a higher power
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.620]   Yeah, it's up there to protect me and so that's how it works. I often refer referred to it as the crazy Google girl
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:52.620]   You know like she'll tell me to do all kinds of crazy things and I've just learned to just just like listen to my life
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.780]   Right, you know for a long time too
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.980]   But that's what's interesting about to me series shortcuts is that and by the way one additional thing
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.700]   They've also dodged the privacy issue Renee because letting the shortcut letting the apps
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.580]   Use what they know about you means Apple doesn't have to spy on you
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.540]   So yes Google in order to do this has to kind of watch when you go to work
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.620]   We'll look at your calendar stuff Apple just says now
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.540]   I will let the apps do it if they have something to say we'll let them say it through Siri
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.660]   There is a downside
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.260]   So like the apps have to donate functionality to the series system the series system based on your behavior will surface it for you
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.220]   Right the downside is that because of the way Google and Amazon do it
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.100]   They're essentially using web API so they get the full functionality of every service immediately because all the big services have APIs
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.380]   Where for serious shortcuts developers gonna have to go in and do the work of surfacing what they think is the most important
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.900]   Behavior is to the system so it's more work for developers more work for services
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.780]   But it's better privacy protection for you
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.660]   So you might not get as many or as much initially
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.940]   But what you get will respect your privacy and won't be used for any projects that you might not approve right?
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.940]   Right
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:06.540]   And there are a lot of other features to iOS 12 and you know as I use it. I'm sure these will all
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.900]   Come up. I for instance just sign into my workflow or
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.540]   started workflow on the
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.980]   iPhone it says do you want to use sync and I said yeah, and this is what you need to create an account for that so I said okay
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.100]   iOS 12 not only filled in the password a strong password
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.700]   But then remembered it and so that's gonna really I'm thrilled to see that and not everybody's using you know
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.020]   our sponsor last pass or one password, but
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.540]   This is gonna really encourage people to make unique long
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.500]   There's huge things for them too
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.380]   So first of all you now get an intercept because previously if you gave anyone your device you gave them your passwords and your wallet
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.540]   And now face ID and touch ID will intercept before it will fill any password
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.220]   So it's much it's much more secure
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.100]   But also there's a password manager API so if you prefer to use last password - later one password
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.300]   All they have to do is provide a hook and it will auto fill based on those instead of based off iCloud teaching
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.340]   So you can keep using the app you're always used to using and I think it's so important for us from a security perspective
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:13.300]   To get away from to get to biometric as fast as possible and get it in preferably a multiple biometrics
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:19.100]   I mean, I'd love to get to a point where it's it's looking for two the two part authentication is two different biometrics rather than
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.320]   You know silly codes, you know that are easy to
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.900]   Well, I mean the thing is is that you know, we keep short codes. We keep easy codes
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.380]   We keep all those things because for convenience
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.740]   We're convenience and for those hard to remember them and you forget them and and you get locked out and so you know getting that
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.820]   Biometric process working I think you know because every time I'm at I'm somewhere
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.700]   You know that I don't want to necessarily show me typing in my code
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.500]   I worry about it and I'm just like I just wish the thing we just look at my face and just go okay
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:53.360]   You're essentially getting that with this because they're using biometrics on the local device and then generating a random string of numbers to give the site
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.180]   Because you can never replace your own biometrics if they get that data
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:02.300]   So it's almost like Apple Pay where they're just creating random tokens storing that with the site and using your biometrics to unlock them for you
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.020]   I'm absolutely and I think that I think that it's uh,
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.760]   The right thing with the work with the workflows or with the
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.140]   shortcuts, I just I still you know as an old shake user wish that
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.740]   That you could do a real nodal connection like when I say this
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.740]   I want all these operations to happen and just be able to drag the things in that I want to do and
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.660]   Connect them all to it and and some of them might be
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:31.860]   dependent on the other ones and go do this then then grab the information from there and put it into here and then do this and I think that
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.740]   For the real geeks, I think that would be it's it's like and I think that at the programming language
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   it's the halfway between
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.420]   shortcuts and
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.740]   Swift is kind of a nodal
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.420]   Programming interface that that would be easy to use to say there's all these things that I want to do
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.380]   I'm not a programmer
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.140]   But I want a little bit more visibility over what I'm gonna do then then what I'm gonna get with shortcuts or with
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.620]   Automator or other things like that where I can tie it all in I think it would be and there's no variables yet
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.940]   So you can't say order me two pizzas order me four pizzas
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.980]   You have to have a separate shortcut for each of the very other for each of the different things you want to do but right version one right?
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.860]   So what else should we talk about what are there? What are their nice new features in iOS 12?
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.660]   Maybe something that we I haven't realized is in there
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:25.860]   Yeah, there's a couple things that are just really good quality of life improvements like face ID will no longer fail hard after one attempt
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.180]   And make you do pass code. Thank you
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.900]   Just keep swiping up over and over again to get it. Oh, I did notice that by the way
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.980]   I noticed that last night that was a relief. Yeah
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.180]   Yeah, and you can throw away app cards again without having to put them into the jiggly mode state
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.980]   You can tell Siri to turn on the flashlight what you couldn't do before but you always wanted when you're in a dark room
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.980]   And didn't want to fumble for your phone
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.380]   They're just they added just a bunch of little things that have been bothering me for a very long time
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.460]   And a lot of those have been fixed now my biggest gripe right now though is they've added
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.380]   They've been adding search to photos for a while and it was it was okay
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.460]   They had categories you could type it in and they'd use machine learning to identify the elements in the picture and give them to you
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.700]   And it was pretty good. It didn't have a lot of cat
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.420]   I mean, there's never enough categories that stuff, but it was okay now they've done search refinement
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:13.380]   So I can type in like San Francisco and get all my San Francisco pictures and type in 2016 and get all the ones from 2016
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.260]   But I can't type in San Francisco 2016
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.660]   It just says nothing because it can't talk it
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.580]   like you have to do the tokenization on and your end and that irks me so much because you should never
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.020]   Stop somebody from typing and never give them no results
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.180]   Everything possible to find a result for them. So
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.660]   Photos has nice new features
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:37.220]   Which you'll see I guess as you kind of use it you'll notice
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.580]   Search stuff is suggested. There's there's some new little
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.740]   For you suggested. Yeah stuff
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.100]   So this is generally and generally I think they
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:57.180]   They a lot of polish has gone into this. There's one thing Renee that I'm maybe over thinking
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:04.500]   But this is on the iPad they moved the time and date from the center. No, you're not overthinking to the left
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:10.060]   Now, why would you do that unless maybe you were thinking of putting a little notch?
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.580]   Right about there in the middle. I also added all the iPhone 10 gestures
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.500]   They overwrote the iPhone dio s 11 gestures. Yeah, I want 10 just so you know
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.620]   I was for gestures you no longer swipe up for instance to get to the control center
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.980]   You do that from the ear what could possibly be coming what could possibly become a little so based that they just don't care
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:37.100]   About that anymore. They're just gonna do it. I'm really glad that there's a unified UI frankly because that was a big issue for me
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.860]   That the iPhone 10 work differently than every other iOS device
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:46.740]   But this this room for the notch I think is gonna to me. I'm gonna I'm gonna make a leap of
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.780]   induction here that maybe in September we're gonna see a new iPad with face
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   horizontal or a
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.220]   Landscape or a portrait notch Leo. Oh, it could be it could be either couldn't it because it's if I if I flip it
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.340]   It's yeah, see so I think it'll be poor. It could be either
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.860]   It's gonna be portrait portrait. It's gonna continue us down
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.460]   It'll be right be right under the regular camera
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.540]   It's maybe just right on the camera. I don't know I
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:21.260]   I really see Apple figuring out a way to make face ID whether the two cameras are vertical or horizontal
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:29.460]   No, really I I've I deal only only on the only on the basis that it would be so offensive would be forced to force
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:34.580]   Someone to because an iPad is not just a handheld device. It's also a device. It's in an easel
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.780]   So if they have if they give it if they give you a keyboard case at point that what that prefers horizontal landscape
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:46.980]   And they're gonna force you to pick it up off the table and twist it. Yeah, I and I feel as though they're gonna figure out a
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.860]   Reason way that you don't have to face ID could there's no reason why I couldn't work if it's on the side, right?
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.100]   No, it was just a generation of show it was a it was a constraint of shipping it for gen one
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   Like does they just had to get it working and they focused on getting it working one way and in fact
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.540]   I noticed that when I'm sleeping lying on my side
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:09.020]   It doesn't do the face recognition, but it's but somebody told me I think it was my micah's art
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.940]   My sergeant told me it's gonna start doing it if I'm on my side
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.460]   You can also register an alternate appearance now
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.820]   So even like if you're an actor or a cosplayer or you wear like big utility glasses or you you do have another appearance
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.540]   You can't you can't do a second person, but you can do a second
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.660]   Oh, no, I was told you could do a second person you can't know second person
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.820]   No, not designed for a second person. They would try to make some some mashup of like a fusion of you
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.060]   Oh, okay, but I could add that's good cuz I wear glasses sometimes
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.700]   Although I have to say face ID has learned about my glasses. Yes, but if there's a dramatic difference like pillow face
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.220]   Cuz I'm sick with Andy and I take on our rolls of Wudang and Woosang in the Chinese opera
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.220]   We we need that
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.540]   There are people who wear these pain
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:54.500]   I will say that if you got if you had if you had the face ID on both on both ends of no land they're not in the middle
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.260]   You get incredible three data. That's all I'm saying. Can I?
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.900]   Can I say that when I first got the when the when the when face ID first came out a
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.620]   Friend of mine was starring in cats on Broadway
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:13.220]   So I did I did arrange to like for he actually put on his makeup especially for this test
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.740]   To see registered his face like without makeup and then in the full
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.380]   in the full
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.780]   Asparagus old Gus the leaf leaf leaf the old Gus makeup
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:30.340]   It did not recognize him in the old Gus makeup in the cats makeup. So there's now you can
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.780]   Now nine to five Mac says that they have been able to use two different people
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.900]   With this tool for it
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.660]   I mean like you you've had two people unlocking for the regular face ID, but it's not it's not the design purpose of that feature
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.620]   Okay, and you can't reset a single face ID
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:54.940]   You have to reset both of them if you reset so it makes sense and that the the language Apple used was
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:03.300]   Face ID can recognize an alternative appearance. Yes that not a different decision tree like you for them for the machine learning model
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:08.580]   It would have to learn like right now. It does you not you it would have to learn not you maybe
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.100]   You or somebody else and then start going down different trees and it's just an order of complete
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.220]   It's not impossible. It's just an order of a much more complex model that they have to build. Yeah
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.060]   So the other thing that's really interesting is that there's the AR
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.220]   I'm gonna call the AR camera because I don't have a better name for it
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.220]   But it's in messages and it's in FaceTime, but it's not in camera and right now it's using just true depth
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.220]   But it's not hard to imagine that come this fall
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.900]   There might be a better camera system and we'll have an honest to goodness AR camera on both sides
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.140]   That might be the explanation for the triple lens camera people are room-marine, right?
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.020]   I think for the year after next but I think for this year
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.460]   We'll just start getting like we talked about last week just so much better depth data
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.540]   That we'd be able to do it on both sides
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.540]   So it wouldn't have the infrared depth sensing, but it would just have better data. Yeah, yeah
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.380]   I think we need this one
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.540]   The camera the the L16
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.260]   That's what we call that silly camera with
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.900]   417
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.980]   I don't know if I really want that so yeah set up an alternate appearance. It's in the face ID and passcode
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:14.980]   Area set up an alternate appearance. That's cool. That's really cool. I will do that as soon as I have an alternate appearance
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.660]   The one thing I also really like and it's part of the series shortcut system
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.780]   But it's also part of the do not disturb system is I would forever like now
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.660]   I put my phone on do not disturb during the show and then I'd forget about it
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   I wouldn't be getting any calls or messages
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.060]   And now it not only will say hey, you know, Renee
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.940]   You have your movie about to start you want to go on to do not disturb
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.820]   But at the end you can set it to automatically come out of it
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.420]   Or it'll tell you when you open your phone that you're still in do not disturb and do you want to stop it?
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.580]   And that saved me well now I no longer have that excuse which kind of terrible
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.100]   Being stuck into not disturb all day
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.700]   Now, uh, let's talk about Mojave because that is also now in public beta
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:00.660]   Is it I have to say I am not unhappy with iOS 12. I don't regret putting it on my main iPad and my main phone
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:06.820]   Uh, I mean there's some hesitation. Maybe I'll miss a call because I can't get the thing to wake up or whatever
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.060]   But so far so good. How about Mojave? Is it what's its status?
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.860]   Same thing it's a beta. So there's some quirky behavior
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.780]   I've had it on both the iMac Pro and my macbook pro since wwdc
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.980]   And one's been fine. I've had a couple like sometimes the icons in the talk aren't there they come back
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.060]   They haven't abandoned me. Um, the dark mode is is really nice
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.100]   I find that a little bit oppressive all day every day. So I like that you can turn you can switch back and forth
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.820]   Yeah, and apple did a lot like it's not just a dark mode
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.700]   It's like the it has a lot of treatment to make it look seamless when you switch back and forth
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.380]   And it also samples the background image and background windows so that it's not
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.980]   Offcast to compare to what the rest of your environment is like
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.740]   Um, so it's a it's a it's a cosmetic change to be sure
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.820]   But it's a very nice cosmetic change and it's one that a lot of people whether you're you know
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.940]   You're using pro apps and you want your content to pop or you're reading in bed
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.260]   You don't want to be hitting head with a pillow all those things. It's much better. Yeah, not only that
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:08.900]   But it took them it took apple this long to allow us to really choose our own highlight color for like highlighting a button
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.020]   So we're instead of having just you have two choices
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.380]   You have both options both slate gray or blue
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.420]   Now if you really want if you want a tangerine highlight color if you want like a red highlight color
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.820]   These are these are colors are
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.300]   When I when I set up the the developer beta
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.780]   It was like I I quickly wound up with leaving my mac in dark mode
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:34.260]   But like a sort of like a sort of a burnt tangerine highlight color and it feels like i'm running winnocks
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.860]   I feel like a badass
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.100]   I use purple because I thought and you would appreciate it
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.260]   If you want to roll back from either. I always 12 or mohavi
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.540]   You can't yeah, just make a backup first. You know, just make sure you do your backup first
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.260]   So back and they do really emphasize that by the way
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.940]   And if you when it what happens when the release versions come out
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.500]   Do you are you now out of the beta program or it depends like you can delete the certificate
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.780]   That's all a certificate system now
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.860]   So you put a certificate on your computer or your phone and it knows to look for the beta branch
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.900]   Instead of the release branch and you can delete that at any time
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.460]   Otherwise, it'll just keep you going into the next because it'll be in a 12 point one and uh
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.900]   And we'll have a point one beta so it'll keep you going that way if you want
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:21.940]   So go to beta.apple.com the apple beta software program public beta is available now for iOS 12 and mohavi
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.500]   How about tv os? Is that a public beta yet?
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.700]   Yep, everything but watch os they don't do watch os because the recovery is so
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.940]   Obviously just terrible
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.940]   You basically have to go to an apple store if anything goes wrong
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.340]   So they don't do public betas for that but for everything else the other thing that's really cool
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:43.380]   I've been trying is the the apple is so in on the privacy stuff and they have the intelligent private tracking prevention
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:51.860]   Which last year just used ml to learn about cross-site cookies and prevent them from surfacing and now it's stamping out facebook like buttons share buttons comment buttons
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.460]   Uh device fingerprinting so they can't they were taking snapshots
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.180]   That was unique configuration profiles for your computer and trying to track that across different websites
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.380]   So now it gives an obfuscated simplified profile
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:11.780]   All that stuff is really nice. Yeah, it's it's I have a feeling that apple is symbol bunting this better than
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.900]   Google did when they tried to do something kind of similar
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   Uh with the new versions of chrome that they released where quickly people figured out that oh well my games aren't working anymore
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:26.260]   My video sites aren't working anymore. It's not it's being it's too powerful and it's not but it's being too powerful in the sense
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:31.060]   That it's not being smart enough whereas it looks like or again at least in the version in the
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.340]   Non beta version that I was using uh, it feels like the new safari is
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.780]   Good, it seems it feels like it's doing a smarter version of it
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:47.060]   It feels like you really do have just this ninja that is effectively only killing the person you told it to kill with no collateral damage
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.300]   And it asks you like it gives you a little drop-down thing. Do you want this stuff and you can say yes? I do
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.220]   And then it's fine, but if you don't like it's not like oh my god. I never knew this stuff was even there
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.660]   That's an underappreciated feature communication with the user
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.860]   Is just as important as the automation that makes these things work
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:08.740]   Well, the users has to feel as though they're in complete control of the situation and like any boss of a company or any good boss of a company
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.500]   You don't necessarily need to do everything that all your employers are doing
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:19.460]   But you at least need to know what your employees do so that you have a good pick you you are in control of this device you actually own
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.180]   So that's that's another area which I I love how apple designs the software and services
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:31.860]   One nice thing about Mojave is opposed to iOS or tvOS is you could make a bootable Mojave disc
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.580]   So you don't have to be
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.380]   Like you could choose, you know, so if you made a booble
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.740]   Is it hard to make a bootable disc you download an installer?
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.220]   It's the same old process where you extract from the package people just put it on a partition
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.940]   I mean they just where they put it on external drive. Yeah, that way you boot to it you could play with it
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.340]   At any but you can go back to
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.420]   The old version if you want high-seer. There's a company
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.500]   I can't think of the name of them that I I just pulled it out of one of my other computers and I haven't put it into here
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.700]   Yeah, they could make the SD card the sdr card becomes a
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:07.620]   Yeah, second drive another drive. Yeah, and it's a great way to do those kind of it was a mini mini drive or something like that
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:13.060]   I had one next or something but I was a kickstarter. Yeah, it works. It works. Well. Yeah, it's not very fast
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:19.380]   It is pretty fast. Is it minus fast? Well, it depends on how fast the the card is. I put a really fast 10 card in there
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.140]   Yeah, I'm just well
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.540]   I'm just nostalgic enough to want to put it on SD cards just so I could relive what it was like in 1986 to have to like switch
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.140]   Switch cards like every time I want to like launch or switch apps
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:40.660]   Oh, the good old days. I just remember when we read I just I can still remember when we read about the idea that there would be these micro SD cards that had 256 gigs
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.660]   And we were like no
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:49.220]   I remember was coming into the old screensavers with a USB key hanging hung around his neck
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.420]   He said this holds two gigabytes and we were all a gas
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.380]   Only the wall
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.980]   Two gigabyte USB drive cost as much as a Bentley in this
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:09.540]   Yeah, no like I'm as as made as amazed as I was at the time about like a one gigabyte flash drive
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:15.940]   When I when I was cleaning up my house stuff. Oh my god a 16 megabyte SD card
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:25.700]   I can take one jpeg with my camera so long as it's like there's not a whole like a brick pattern with a lot of detail. It's uncomfortable
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:31.540]   I bought a I know rubino just you know, just reviewed a one terabyte del
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.340]   Flash drive. It's like it's like 700 bucks, but it's one together
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:44.820]   But see this is I get so like excited and confused when I see like a half a terabyte like flash drive like a flash key
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.820]   Now we're getting into I could see myself losing this device
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.540]   And this is this is the reason why I I own flash
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:57.460]   Flash keys, you know for transportation, but I kind of make sure I don't buy the really really big
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.020]   Take of doing that. I bought four 128 gig. They're beautiful. They were aluminum
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.500]   128 gig. I guess this you know thumb drives and I can't find them. I know there's someone
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:12.260]   Story of the final version of return to the king they put it on an iPod because the only thing big enough at the time
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.860]   And they had to walk it from the fiber to wetter and a guy started chasing them
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.540]   And he started running trying to get to wetter because he had the only
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.140]   That's when I started to leave it on steel
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.380]   Uh
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.220]   I bought just uh this week
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.380]   I'm thinking about my vacation in the fall. We're gonna have some water sports
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.540]   So I wanted a little point and shoot waterproof point and shoot got the new olympus tg5
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.180]   Which is nice little dust proof of water. I've had it before
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.060]   It's really nice. So I put I thought well I have a 64 gig SD car to put it in there
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.340]   It says you can get 9999 pictures
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:51.620]   Oh, that's probably last me the entire lifetime of the camera
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:57.540]   Why don't I just like push down the shutter button when I when I go off the plane tape it down
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.420]   The whole trip take off the tent. I get home
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.660]   9900 and I think it didn't say 10,000 only because it didn't have more digit space. It was like
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.340]   It's like asteroids. It it looked over. It looked I have I've given that I've gotten into buying
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:17.860]   I haven't gotten one from my 10, but I've gotten into buying you know the the divable shells for the iphone
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.540]   Do they make them? I think they make them for the 10. I I have them for an older phone
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.300]   I've been sick makes me nervous. I mean they these are theoretically waterproof, right?
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.620]   It doesn't make me nervous, uh, but I've you know
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:33.060]   I tested it gingerly with an older phone and then started using it and what's great is that then it's just on your role
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.300]   Yeah, it's got the gps and it's got all the other everything
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.340]   Yeah, but you can shoot underwater and you know all the other stuff. I'm gonna
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.260]   This olympus was 300 bucks. It wasn't that expensive and I thought yeah
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.700]   It's great to have one that you can take water. The nice thing is about is that you're not going traveling where you're
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:53.780]   You have a camera that you could lose. You use your phone. You're really bummed. Yeah, I don't want it was my phone. Yeah, so it I definitely have
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:59.700]   Also throw away cameras. Also olympus. That's like the they've been making these really absolutely
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:07.540]   comfortable cameras for like 10 12th the first one I had I tried to kill it and I just plain couldn't and the idea of having three
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.820]   If I if I were going on vacation, I would consider as a if it were a really good one with my family
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.820]   I'd maybe I consider getting an action camera
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:20.820]   But I don't know whether I would decide to get a something like a gopro or something like the tg5
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.140]   Because the tg5 you're taking much better pictures. You're taking a really good video
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.900]   But also it really is you can drop it. No problem. You can get it wet. You can get in sand. No problem
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.380]   I'm really I'm actually
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.540]   The last one I had was about eight or nine years ago
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.260]   And that was a loner that I decided to just buy because I was using it enough
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:47.300]   But I'm actually considering only adding one to my to my stash of cameras because there are those like two or three times a year where
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:53.780]   Okay, I think my omd em1 is waterproof and does proof enough for this
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.620]   I don't know that it's waterproof and does proof enough for this and I would love to have a camera looks great
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.980]   You know, I'll bring it next time and you can you can play with it
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.500]   I mean, it's it's a point and shoot, but it's not hugely expensive f2 lens, which is nice 4x zoom
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.020]   It does shoot raw. That's great. Which is nice and 4k video
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.940]   So and the main thing you know, I think I had it because of you
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:22.180]   Andy I bought it like the tg1 or something and so I decided to get this
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.820]   You know up to date because I gave the the other one to my one of my kids at one point
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.220]   Uh down to 15 meters. There are you know, you can go deeper if you want to scuba
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:36.740]   You can get a deeper one than this, but this is fine for me. I'm not going down past more than 45 feet
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.500]   Yeah, right
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.900]   50 feeds enough for me. I way down. Yeah, I think I'll probably uh one or two feet
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.100]   They'll be able to take the camera off your body and find out what the damn full thing you did that got you drawn
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.340]   Exactly. It's tougher. I don't I don't need a camera. That's tougher than I am
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.820]   It's only 12 megapixels, but I think that they do that so they can get better low light performance
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.060]   I don't think they I think they realize nobody really wants
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:05.700]   Of you know, I mean this is the other camera. I'm bringing is 42 megapixels. So I think that I probably set
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.340]   But but see this one I wouldn't want to get wet
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.700]   I call the fun out of it
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:16.740]   Yeah, people people don't appreciate that you would much rather have a 12 megapixel sensor
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.020]   That's way way more light sensitive because they'll they'll take a cat
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.460]   They'll take their their waterproof camera or their phone and waterproof housing
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:29.300]   And then they'll go down even just like eight feet close to shore and surprise that oh here's a nice picture of
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.140]   dark green with flat shoes of dark blue, right?
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:38.820]   It's there's like no the little cameras are not set up to get light that gets that's been filtered through eight feet of sea water
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:45.940]   Exactly. This has a backscatter mode that uh, just they I haven't tried it, but it supposedly does a good job underwater and stuff like that
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.060]   I don't know. It's it's cheap enough. The list is 380. I think I got it for 340 on amazon
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.900]   It's cheap enough that use a lot of bioluminescence. Yeah a lot of bioluminescence
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.900]   We're a heady and until you get to 13 000 feet when the when the non-terrestrial intelligence
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.220]   Of spaceship gets there then because like we're like when you say they're bioluminescent
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.620]   They'll also make sure that you can breathe a crush depth. So
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.900]   This I don't remember if the old one had this, but they have these
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.860]   Super macro modes now in these which is kind of cool so you can get they call a microscope
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.660]   Moved, it's really a macro mode, but it really can get pretty close to stuff, which is also kind of fun
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.140]   I don't know. It's a it's a it's an adjunct
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:29.380]   Because what I what I said i'm gonna do on this trip chris mark wart just convinced me to only bring a
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.140]   Where is the trip?
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.460]   Oh my god. It's an amazing trip. Are you allowed to tell? Yeah go start in Barcelona
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.180]   Go to portugal spay
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.100]   Malta
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.220]   France
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.220]   Italy we're going to posit
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.420]   Positano
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.540]   We're going to a mauffi the mauffi coast, but other than that we're going to maraco going to
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.660]   So it's uh, how long are you? How long are you traveling? It's almost a month when?
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.900]   September I won't be here just warning you nothing's happening
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.940]   Just yeah, nothing ever happens in september does it? Oh, i'm actually feeling terrible
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.900]   I don't know why I booked a trip during the apple announcement
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.820]   Once again, uh, who knows they haven't announced it yet. Maybe it'll be october
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.940]   No, I just you know what I feel so bad that they don't invite me. I decided well screw you i'm going to bar cilona
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.580]   I'm not available even if you try to invite me
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.100]   But tapas and ham that's what you
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.940]   Well, you're
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.420]   Right, a thousand words the good news is I know i'll be able to order that iPhone from wherever I am
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:37.680]   instantaneously face idea and and you and the ability you're gonna be in the presence of so many wonderful
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.780]   Fezzes
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:46.900]   Basically a hat trip. I'm gonna bring back hats from every land. I endorse
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.460]   It sounds like it's going to be a scene from bookland nine nine where leo tries to order
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.020]   But his hands are so comforting yambon barrica that no
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.300]   It's too slow for me
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:02.660]   But no, so i'm only gonna bring a fixed prime manual focus
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.980]   And then this is the this is the a7r 2 which has a 42 megapixel really like almost medium format
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.700]   So this is going to be like for a really good picture that takes an hour to compose and shoot
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.940]   And then i'll have the point and shoot in my phone this fire
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.580]   Just fire
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.580]   Uh, anyway, I don't I shouldn't really I don't i'm sorry. I brought it up
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:31.220]   Uh, us people get i'm not gonna talk about vacations. I should because no hungry. Thanks to you ranae. I'm thinking of ham again
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.700]   Yeah, I know but I haven't been to bar cilona in like seven or eight years
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:41.860]   But I still remember that just like I remember all the all the all the guiness I drunk and doublin
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:46.180]   I have lightning memories of every single ham that I ate in bar cilona
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:46.660]   All right
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.180]   Well, I want to really make you jealous now because I when we go to town
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:56.340]   Sometimes I just booked this thing called tours by locals where you get local people to take you around and I booked a tapas tour
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.340]   Uh for one of the evenings. Yeah, that'll work. Yeah
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.500]   Stop you stop eating a day in a local bar cilona natives
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.540]   You're gonna need that macro ones
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.700]   Oh, i'm gonna roll out of there right now
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.980]   Oh
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   I showed today brought to you by a very important sponsor when I
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:23.940]   What don't tell them this but I really would we've been giving them free ads for about 10 years and say it first came out last pass
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.180]   Uh, actually, I've been using last pass almost forever personally
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.300]   Steve Gibson I convinced him that he should be using it
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.780]   But first he said no I want to talk to the founder and the technology guy and see
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:41.300]   And he interviewed joe seagriss. Joe was great. He showed him the code the javascript everything
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.780]   Steve Gibson this was some years ago gave it his seal of approval still uses last pass
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.980]   And then we started using it for the company because something happened
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:56.580]   We had an engineer who couldn't remember all of our passwords like to our website and our servers and the you know
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:02.020]   The money and so he just put it on a webs he published it on public website so he could find it easily
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:07.380]   And when that happened I realized we need last pass at work as well. We got last pass enterprise
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.940]   Now we have we have secured
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.460]   All of the most important stuff 81 percent of breaches
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.500]   Are caused by weaker reused passwords
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:23.220]   You want to protect your passwords at work every password in our business is protected, but it doesn't slow down employees
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:32.020]   It's the onboarding is easy password auto fill both on the on the phone and in the web makes it really easy to use
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.500]   We get automated security reports
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:41.700]   We take control of our passwords it simplifies last pass enterprise simplifies password management for companies of every size
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:50.100]   And centralizes control of employee passwords and apps. This was something what we we really needed every employee gets their own secure vault for managing passwords
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.500]   We set master password requirements length and things like that
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.820]   We also require two factor you can do that as well and we do it
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:05.220]   Um, you can restrict access to specific locations and devices all of last passes versions do that
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.220]   That was a nice thing when I got to japan last pass I tried to use last passes and well you're not
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:14.340]   You've said you don't want to be able to use it outside the us you better and so I had to re authenticate
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.380]   Uh directly with last pass so I could use it wasn't a hard thing, but it was a great thing because
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:25.940]   That keeps somebody from out, you know, some somebody in russia or china from hacking my last pass
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.100]   Uh, you have as a as the enterprise version has last pass
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.740]   Uh password resets we could turn those on
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.420]   Um, it really makes it easier to share passwords to employees
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.540]   Can share passwords within folders folders are limited to certain classes of employees
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.740]   So we keep everything secure and of course everything's encrypted at device level with aes 256
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:53.780]   Prevents man in the middle attacks. It's a trust. No one system even last pass doesn't have access to the contents of your vault
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:58.340]   Um, it's just the best way to secure your business your personal
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.860]   If you're not using last pass do me a favor
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:08.100]   Do it right now last pass premium for personal use last pass families for the entire family
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.660]   Last pass teams for teams are 50 or less
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:17.060]   And last pass enterprise for the businesses at work and at home fix your password woes with last pass
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.780]   It's the number one most preferred password manager. It's the one we use and by the way every employee
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:27.060]   We do this as a benefit, but it also is a benefit to us every employee gets their own personal last pass
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.580]   When you work here and that's because I want everybody to be secure last pass dot com slash
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:38.660]   Twit to protect every password in your business last pass dot com slash twit and individuals, please
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.700]   You should be using it too. It's not is easy. It's fast. It works. We've been using it for
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.780]   I don't know if I was a curious. Oh, yeah, we run the whole company like and what's great about it is
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.580]   We do a lot of things that are secure and a lot of times I don't want to share it
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.220]   So I you know you have a folder that is these these things are there
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.900]   They don't get the password they never see the password they can log in but they don't get the password
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.220]   I love that feature. They can't change it. They can't see it and then you also set it up. I set it up so that
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.740]   Anytime you log into last pass I liked from a security perspective it logs out of everything else
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:11.380]   So every time I move along I only have one thing open and that's just a setting that you can set as an admin
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.740]   But it's it's a there are a lot of nice tweaks you can do to it
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.260]   Uh that make it even more secure and I turn on a lot of those features, especially two-factor
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:27.380]   I was for a long time I was using it with a ubiki so you have a hardware I've to log into it. Yeah, um, that's a great feature as well
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:33.140]   Uh, all right, rene richy. Let's get the latest on the brute force password
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.900]   hack
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:40.740]   Um, not yeah, yeah, this so or not. Yeah as the case may be yeah, so the idea was
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:47.300]   um, uh, that an attacker could send all the passwords at once
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:53.140]   Yes with no spaces one string with no spaces and that somehow I and this puzzled me
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.660]   The iphone would see each four digits separately but
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.940]   Wouldn't count them so it wouldn't trigger the password
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.980]   You know the data erasing feature because it wouldn't it wouldn't it would see it as one attempt
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.020]   um, so
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.500]   Ionic who's the guy who created this
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:16.900]   Uh, he didn't forget hacker fantastic did yeah hacker fantastic created at ionic was very quick to
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:24.260]   To say that doesn't sound right to me though. Right. So yeah hacker fantastic then said it seems ionic might be right
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.900]   The pins don't always go to the secure enclave in some instances
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:34.900]   Uh due to pocket dialing overly fast input so although it looks like pins are being tested
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:39.780]   They aren't always set some are some aren't so you and I guess when he chart tested it
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:45.620]   He lucked out that he he had a pin that was tested but it wouldn't guarantee you the entire set apple
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.020]   Confirm this to you rene. Yes
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.780]   Um
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:55.700]   The the recent report this is apple statement that they gave you the recent report about a pass code bypass on the iphone was an error
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.260]   And a result of incorrect testing
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.900]   But that sounds like some of the codes go
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:07.700]   I there was a whole long list on twitter and you could follow um hacker fantastic threads just to see all of it
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:12.580]   But it sounds like he sent a bunch and then sent the correct one as the as the lead of a string
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:17.860]   And that's why it worked, but that was just happenstance. It would have to be the first thing in the string for it to work
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.820]   Okay
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:24.420]   He also pointed out that it does take some time and if you had a six digit code which all modern devices do
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.460]   It would be virtually impossible to crack
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:34.020]   Or like Andy said last week if you have a pass like an alphanumeric password you might as well go watch the heat death of the universe
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:39.300]   Yeah, come back later. That's by the way because of that for the last few months. I've got a really long
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.140]   Pain in the ass to edit her, but it's good
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:48.740]   And that and that was more about the law enforcement and and celebrate and all this stuff
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:53.380]   Uh, but it's good thing to have the stronger the password the better in general
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:59.860]   So this is there's nothing to worry about here. This hacker fantastic is basically withdrawn his his claim
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.540]   Yeah, and uh zero day charlie showed up to say hey
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.780]   Maybe all you magazine shouldn't just look at a tweet and write a whole article on it
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.740]   That actually asked the researcher or call apple first
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:15.060]   It's really is all those stories came from people just seeing a tweet. Yeah
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.780]   Yeah
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.620]   I think really journalists should be
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.540]   Back then journalists should be banned from twitter. I see far too much too many stories
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.580]   That basically come from a tweet
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.140]   I think we could like yeah
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.340]   I mean just like you can like anytime there's black hat is about to come up
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.780]   It feels like they read through all the abstracts and then just post a bunch of stories
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.820]   Right based on that and the thing is like and because there's almost nothing that gets your attention like panic
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.020]   Like if you tell someone the house is on fire people pay a lot of attention
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.980]   But that ends up being the exploit the exploit is your article not think to do with the bits or bites
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.940]   I mean, this is I think this is for the most part press
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.300]   Everywhere uh today is the there's such a
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.820]   You're gonna see to get the story
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.100]   You don't want to be the last one to cover it a desperation for attention
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:04.580]   Point anything anything that says that sizzles at all is gonna get you a bunch of views
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.660]   It's gonna get you more advertising dollars even if it's not true and exactly unfortunately
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.900]   I think there are some publications that don't really care about the
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.980]   You know, it's the tmz style of reporting. It's not about the vera
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.780]   Like time
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.260]   magazine
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.100]   I think it's more like the the cable news type of
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.940]   Of newscasting and not that they people want to
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.180]   Are happy about reporting on a story where they don't have the facts
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:36.420]   But if they don't if they have to keep people they have to stay on the air and saying
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:41.380]   We still have no information about the presence of that missing plane in two minutes
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:45.620]   We'll be talking to an expert in aviation who quit the industry three years ago
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.540]   Who will tell us why he doesn't know where the plane is either
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.620]   And that's oftentimes where these things come from
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:57.620]   I will say that there was a lot of uh, uh, uh, there's a lot of discussion when uh,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:02.980]   There's there's a lot of discussion when when, uh, there when, uh, uh
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.380]   I'm sorry. I got
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.780]   I got distracted by a bright shiny object
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.860]   The great keys
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:15.460]   When when great he said that hey, don't worry about apples coming up with this this way to make it harder
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.300]   Don't worry. Not only have we already tested our box against it and it works
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:23.860]   But we've also put it in future-proofing features that make sure that apple really can't do that
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:28.020]   That led to a lot of speculation within the profession
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:34.980]   About what they could possibly be talking about or if they're just sort of blowing smoke so that they don't lose contracts
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.380]   Uh, and right now
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.500]   The people who I have access to and at least the stuff they're willing to tell me
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.300]   They still have no idea what great he could be talking about
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.620]   Uh, and but they're very very but the people I've been talking to they're very honest with me about saying that either
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:54.340]   They are blowing smoke or they really have discovered something that is so cool that they absolutely do not want anybody else to know about it
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.780]   Uh, in either any their case they think is equally equally possible
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   One of the one of the bigger problems too is like there's things like Forbes contributor network
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:06.180]   And there was a story that apple was going to replace the iphone 10 with a lower cost model
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.980]   And they said their story was apple cancels iphone 10
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:14.900]   And last week there was a story that apple was apple like google and like other manufacturers is toying around with the idea
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.460]   Of removing physical ports and their story was apple is removing lightning port from iphone 10
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.540]   Which would entail you apple going to your house and physically yanking it out of your phone
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:32.900]   I just can't remove it from my phone tan. It's it's in there. Yeah, but yeah, and it's it's all these words like is and will and and and
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:38.820]   Like the fin when you hear when you also see like in the in the headline definitive phrases
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.540]   uh like breaking story or
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:47.700]   Proof positive like well, then you read it said no, they talk to a guy. Yeah, exactly. That was what that was
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.420]   Look for confirmed apple apple restoring
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:57.620]   Headphone jack to the new iphone saying you mean that you have actually held in your hand a shrink wrap box
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:03.860]   Unwrap the box and seen that there's or no you talk to an analyst that you talked to once before
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:09.780]   Who says that here? Yeah, that's ridiculous. There was a story though. Leo too over the weekend about the keyboards
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:16.420]   Yes, this is a link. This isn't link bait this headline apple admits its computers are broken
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.060]   No, don't read that article
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.580]   This is casey jonston on the outline
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:26.180]   I love casey jonston, but the outline has just the most please look at me headline
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.860]   I bet you casey didn't write that headline. I don't know why i'm thinking about they did an answer a repair program
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:38.900]   For the butterfly keyboards though, right? This is something you've wanted. Yeah, so it's it's very specific
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.900]   It is not um, it's not a recall so you can't just take your macbook and have the keyboard replaced
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.780]   It's not a replacement program so that all the keyboards really plays
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.460]   It's a service program so that if you exhibit one of the specified issues
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:53.620]   They will replace it for you for free the entire keyboard or the key cap
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:57:00.180]   Either today or for the next four years from the date in which you per and though if you had repairs they'll refund you
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.380]   Which is great. Yeah, so what are the specific?
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:12.660]   Issues that they will be fixing a stuck keys non responsive keys repetitive keys anything that basically affects the reliability of entering
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:17.060]   Of tapping that button and making that character appear on the screen. So you have to have the problem
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.340]   It's not a recall you have to have the problem and then they'll fix it
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:25.380]   But you've had that problem on how many laptops one out of one out of eight now. Okay
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:31.540]   I have I've had the macbook and this goes back to the original mac book where they first started using the butterfly key
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.740]   And all the macbook pros with the butterfly keys one and two
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.380]   These are only the butterfly keys because we have problems with these
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:42.500]   With I have always with the scissor keys too. Yeah, so yeah, I've had I've had the chickler replaced as well
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:47.060]   So but there this is this particular repair program is for the butterfly keys though
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:52.660]   And it doesn't count water damage or anything else is only for failure of the mechanism due to dust or some other faulty keyboard
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:59.140]   It has to be a faulty keyboard and they also say they may replace one key or all of the keys
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:03.860]   They don't which is a change because previously they would always do the entire case which is why it was so expensive. Yeah
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:10.580]   But but that is significant the like Renee says this isn't there apple sometimes has a policies where if you
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.060]   were to bring in
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:17.700]   An iPad for just because oh well like I forgot my passcode. How do I get her?
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.180]   How could how do I like read whatever and then oh and they scan it so they realize that oh well
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:28.820]   Your your your device has a has an alert for us and that we will we will swap it out for a new battery because
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.700]   We've determined that there's a problem that we need to proactively fix
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:38.900]   This isn't that uh, but the the fact that they are saying that for now from now on the essentially the the keyboard is
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.540]   The keyboard within any reliable
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:46.660]   Determination of something the user did not do that caused the keyboard to fail
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:52.180]   The we're now extending the warranty by four years. They wouldn't have done that if they didn't see a
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:56.260]   Hugely alarming amount of repair problems that were coming in about it
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:02.340]   And or it wasn't becoming such a flagrant pain in the butt for pr that they had to do something about it
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.220]   And this is this is really all I this is really all I ever wanted
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:09.380]   I think that it's it's okay if apple doesn't recall that that would be saying that the keyboard was
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.980]   Was fundamentally defective which I disagree which is a termination
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.860]   I don't I disagree with but the just tell me that
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:21.380]   If there is if it's provable that a lot of that more people than normal a hugely number
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.100]   Of more people are having problems with this keyboard
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:29.700]   All you got to do is all all it's okay with me if if if I lose my keyboard for three or four days
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:34.740]   So long as it's not going to cost me nine hundred dollars because one year and three days later
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.100]   Suddenly I have no vowels on my keyboard that doesn't seem like
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:42.100]   Uh a device that earns the apple seal of quality of redesign approval
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.420]   And I did talk to a bunch of people in a bunch of different departments
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:50.420]   And I I do think it is it is a lot of it is what happens in apple is it's a big company
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:54.260]   It has procedures and all these procedures get followed and sometimes doesn't feel like they're listening
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:58.820]   But often it's tripped by numbers and if the apple did previously they did a battery recall
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:04.420]   Because the number of incidents exceeded what was considered tolerable for that product and so it ought to
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.820]   The process gets started apple reviews and they say yep
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.500]   We need to do a battery effects on these this never reached that level for keyboard
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.820]   It sounds to me like the sentiment was so bad though
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   And that's probably why it's our service program and not a replacement program because if did it hit
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.500]   A level where they're like oh these keyboards are just bad. We've got to replace them
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.100]   It would have been a replacement program, but it sounded like it was just so toxic that they knew they had to do something
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.140]   And even though the numbers weren't quite there yet. They wanted to go ahead and do it
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:33.860]   Well, there are three class action lawsuits. Does it does it do you think they're sued for everything?
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.900]   I'm sure like yeah
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.860]   And also if you read the lawsuits, I don't think they're gonna go very far because the the filing
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.580]   Makes the claim that apple knew that these things were defective but shift them anyway
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.620]   As opposed to it seems and realize that there is a legal definition of defective
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.580]   That means that they should not have shipped this to begin with as opposed to there is just a higher return rate and a higher
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:00.420]   Higher problematic rate coming back with these things. I don't really think that these suits are going to go anywhere
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.820]   But I think this is direct this is
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.460]   This is triggered by those suits because
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.540]   As you say andy if you can't meet the higher standard
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.820]   Which I'm sure it'll be very difficult to meet that apple knew
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:18.500]   Nevertheless if apple shows good will by saying well, we do have a repair program
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.420]   I think the judge looks at that and says you're fine. You've satisfied all the requirements
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.340]   So my guess they did this because of these class action lawsuits. This is the
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.740]   Puzzle
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:35.220]   They there's also a small percentage for it is still a lot of people like a tran even if it's just like if it's one percent of apples face
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:41.380]   That's a small percentage, but that's a lot of people so apples bottom line still like even if you go into an apple store today
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.060]   They would like to keep you as a customer
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.940]   It's cheaper for them to keep you as a customer than try to go get a new customer
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.620]   So they can do this and make people very happy and it's much better than in fact ultimately
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.020]   That's the real argument. It's the right thing to do for customers
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:57.860]   I do think they acknowledge that there is a much higher level of problem with this these styles of people in the previous ones
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.500]   I well, I I have no firsthand knowledge
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.660]   But I don't think they would have done this just simply as a PR good will gesture
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.740]   I don't think they would have done this
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.380]   I don't think they would have I think they would have still done this if there hadn't been that class action suit
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.980]   But this does give them again a really really good out
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:21.060]   This if it were a more serious problem. I think it would have been anytime that a model keyboard that
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:26.820]   With a series range of serial numbers comes in the apple store guess what we will we will swap out that entire plate or we will
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.500]   Essentially clean out the entire keyboard anytime you want to come and bring it in
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.900]   I do but I think that another factor was just that this is one
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.300]   I can't think of
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.220]   An apple pro an apple hardware problem that was a worse thumb in the eye
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:46.900]   Then again, you've had this machine for less than two years and now keyboard keys are not working
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:51.300]   And you've you've had you've had mac books for the past 10 years
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:57.140]   You have never had keyboards fail before like three or four years before and now apple is telling you we're asked
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.060]   Five years ago. They said oh well. We're going to replace your keyboard
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:08.020]   There'll be 200 $300 for the new keyboard and $100 for service and they're saying that well because we are essentially gluing all of these together
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:13.380]   We're going to have to charge you more than half the purchase your original purchase price for this device
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:19.380]   That is the sort of thing that says or I could take that thousand dollars and buy something that was not made by apple
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:25.540]   The company that sold me an expensive machine that broke after one month after warranty in a stupid way and now
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.380]   I won't fix it for any reasonable amount of money
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.540]   Well, and I think the hard part that apple has also is that they released this
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:36.100]   They released the macbook pro and a lot of us said oh those keyboards are horrible
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.220]   And then it turned out, you know, of course the i'd the sell is is that well
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.700]   They're new and they're expensive amazing it turns out you just you just haven't given it a chance yet
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.060]   Wait wait wait wait wait wait
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   We've decided so that so that like english muffin crumbs are the necessary lubricant that will give you that force resistant
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.540]   Resistance you've been missing from previous models
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.780]   I mean, I I think the problem for me is I'm still I'm still on a 2015 and I'm not in any rush to move
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.300]   You know mostly because of magsafe and the keyboard or the two
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.220]   I think I think the problem is Alex that you have taste you have class
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.660]   So it's also a graphics card replacement for some of the models too. That's a separate program
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:20.980]   Well and you hear us previous the worst news that I have for today is that I was we're having some trouble with playback on something and
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:26.020]   Kevin Hanson who's on who who was at pix score was he was playing something
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:31.780]   It was really smooth on his computer and not on ours and I was like what that computer is different because 2017
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.340]   I mean 17 inch. I'm sorry. It's a 17 inch
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.220]   That was smoother plays back
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:42.580]   Play some of the stuff we were doing back better the graphics card in the 17 inch which is ancient
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:49.220]   2011 or something like that is better than the one that's that's on the computer now. That's depressing. Not that I'm bitter
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   Why don't you have e ggv use? That's the apple
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:57.460]   Discrete this whole discrete card in the 15 inch of the new macbook pros
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.460]   It's just not in the 13 or the baseline. Maybe you guys just don't have the discrete card in the other ones
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.380]   We turned them all on. I mean, you know, we turned on all the you know, we yeah
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:11.460]   Renee what did you do with the one that you had problems with? Did you bring it in and get a fixed? No, I air I
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.180]   You were able to clean it. Yeah, I cleaned it
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.460]   But they're apples not refunding all that air though. It's just sad
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.900]   So some people are able to fix these it's not that you can't fix them
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.300]   So my again, this is just a guess but apple
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   This part of this design was supposed to make it not just flatter but also
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:33.780]   Wear better and dust is harder to get in but when it gets in it's almost impossible to get out to get out
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.220]   Yeah, so
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:41.060]   That that didn't work out great. My only issue with the keyboard is just the as the lack of travel and the way it lands
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.660]   Which is a little harder than I'd like I'd like it to be a little so loud. I don't mind the clacky. It's clacky. Yeah
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.860]   Uh, that's the other thing that didn't bother me quite so much
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.900]   But but but the loudness never bothers the person typing
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:59.540]   It's a symptom. It's a symbol of the fact that the travel is so short and that the end is so abrupt
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:03.940]   That's why it's clacky if they put a little cushion under there. I might not have that problem
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.260]   Interesting you see what they do come
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:11.460]   I have a clacky. Do you think they'll come do you think come the fall will get new Mac books?
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.900]   Uh, yeah
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:17.540]   But I don't know if this if they're gonna have new new because a lot of people are waiting for their redesign right like with the
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:22.020]   Yeah, uh to face ID camera in it and they get delete all the bezels
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.580]   It's pretty pretty early to redesign that
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:30.740]   They just these are these are new as of 2016 these news. Well, we'll probably get the new iPads and then we'll get a
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.540]   spec bump coffee lake
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.180]   I don't know. I just cold-nung this 2015 as long as I know
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.500]   Well, they still you know that there's a problem when they still sell it. It was flickering
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:45.540]   But they would they sold the cd rom version of the mac pro for like 10 years after you could argue
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:50.420]   They sell it because some businesses will only buy it with the magsafe or they may be older ports
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:07:02.100]   Yeah, magsafe and magsafe and the magsafe and the magsafe and not only that but s
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.860]   Essentially build way more than they need have them in stock and then keep pressuring them
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.260]   Excuse me fresh in this new soft. I wish they would refresh the processors that it would be fine
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.420]   Yeah, I
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.900]   Processors they use uh until finally ship them a month or two ago and they're being integrated now
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.900]   Which is why I think we'll see them
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.380]   Ah
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.900]   Which was
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.060]   Those capy legs. Oh, okay, no coffee late Intel's announced coffee lake and yeah
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.820]   But intel ounces like one processor nine months before the rest and right so they apple typically waits for the multi-core ones
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.820]   That also have the vega pro graphics
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.260]   Okay, but the the iris pro. Sorry the iris pro graphics, right?
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:39.540]   Um and those apparently came out like a month or two months ago
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.660]   Yeah, exactly well
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:46.500]   We knew those came out and then there was some issue that they maybe weren't producing them in great enough quantity because we've seen
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.380]   I mean some of the some of the pc makers are shipping those or announced them
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.580]   Uh, but they may only make 30,000 of them apple wouldn't and some of them frankly are not reliable
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.060]   Like we saw a bunch of windows vendors rushed to skylake and those things wouldn't shut down properly
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:07.620]   Furnaces and your bags and I think apple has learned to very very carefully test these at very large quantities before rolling them out
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:10.660]   Well, and I think that one of the things that I mean apple does things
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.940]   It's such a high precision that there is just high failure rates internally. They usually they don't get out to us
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:24.260]   But I mean I I heard from somebody a long time ago that that like the when they put change to this new keep the new trackpad
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   It was like the rejection was like 40 percent
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:33.140]   You know in the factory. I mean so when we think about like what their profit margins are on all these machines when you know an analyst looks at it
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.220]   Yeah, sure if you're not throwing any of them away
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.540]   So here's the there's 17 as according to cnet as of now 17
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:45.380]   Laptops of these new six core i7s these new coffee lake six core
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:50.500]   I would love a six core with and I think do these these have uh discreet
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.180]   Graphics is it the AMD that's paired with these?
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:01.940]   I think some of them are the frankenstein chef the frankenstein frankenstein's so this is the asus rog the samsung odyssey 7
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:08.660]   Or i'm sorry z there's several of those the msig t series so far the of of these
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.620]   Only the asus is available at amazon right now
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:18.980]   Alienware the so it's a lot of gaming machines the del g 315 is available at del right now
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.060]   um
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:28.500]   Quad core though not not not x core yeah and when apple gets them they also do a ton of customization work with intel where they do everything like power nap
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:36.260]   And they they deeply integrate and the t the t chip and some lap like the macbook pro's has to take over the the apple pay and the display of apple
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:41.380]   Pay graphics, but it has to work with the main system to do that and it's it's a little bit of work
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.780]   Let me just quickly see I think I can figure
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:50.740]   This is one of my favorite pc laptops if they would only run mac software i'd be if I could just get maco as
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.580]   On on one of these let me see if I can configure this
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.460]   uh with the hexa core
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.180]   processors
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:05.780]   I bet I can I do like bell though because I still have a still have Lenovo and I forget the other company
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.940]   The
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.500]   Optane is the other thing I would really like love to get a
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:15.700]   I9 with octane that's the new memory that knew the new 3d memory
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:19.060]   the crossover across point memory and
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.380]   And sss i mean who are still gonna be upset because they still don't even coffee like as far as I know doesn't support more than 16 gigabell
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:34.020]   Bites of low low power ram is that true? Oh, that's disappointing. Yeah, intel has been quiet intel is not having a good year late intel is not going to have a good decade
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:43.460]   I'm feeling I'm feeling that the times have come the time has come great article by ben Thompson's trajectory about really why intel is struggling
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:48.740]   Of course they just end of the hairnet a good one place their ceo. Yeah, ben it would he quotes ben beherin in it
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.980]   um, uh, I think intel's gonna have some trouble going
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:11:00.820]   They have they have somewhat they have some of an atlas problem where their processors are holding up 80
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:06.980]   Of the computers in the world which means that as much as they might want to do something revolutionary as much as they might want to
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:12.100]   To make a huge huge sweeping change and maybe eat it for a couple of years while they do the transition
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:17.780]   There are too many suppliers that are giving them way too much money for making these really successful chips
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:25.460]   It's really hard for them to have the same influence over their product line as apple apple can have over the cpu's that are in the aisles devices
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.420]   Ben noske had a great thread. Did you see that one leo?
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.660]   Um because he had to deal with them when he ran windows
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:35.860]   He was saying that almost all the time they were talking about how they could screw over amd not how they could make good products
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:40.340]   And he always thought that that would bite them in the end if you you just can't run a company that way
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:46.820]   ben's point is a little bit more nuanced, but he says intel really box themselves in because
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:51.940]   One of the reasons for their success early on was tight integration with windows
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:59.060]   With the operating system, but he says intel ended up being hemmed in by its integrated approach. That's why they missed
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:00.660]   mobile
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.540]   It's why they missed graphics, right there lara b
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:10.260]   Architecture was an x86 graphics chip and it didn't it failed compared to nvidia and amd
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.860]   Uh and now their current crisis is that a number of
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:20.580]   Fabs are down to seven nanometers intel can't seem to get down that side and then the rise in processors the new pro
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.180]   The new multi core processors from nvidia actually pretty good
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:30.020]   Intel's management rights ben did not break out of the integration mindset design and manufacturing
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.660]   We're soon to be in lockstep forever
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:39.540]   and ultimately that's some that's a box that they're gonna have a very hard time breaking out of and it's and it's why you know
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.660]   But but it's a cautionary tale for apple because apple wants to do the same thing
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.820]   but it's also why apple's
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.940]   Design chips do so so much a better job. They're integrate. They're tightly integrated to the os
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.900]   Well, and you have things like apple pushing for metal
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.980]   Which is a good example of you know
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:58.500]   It wants to make sure that it works really well across all the platforms
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.740]   And so it's written code that optimizes for that and then it's going to build processors that optimize, you know
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.940]   And they're working and they're working with um, you know
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.060]   I think amd is going to go or has already built metal support
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.020]   But sannoski's thing was interesting because he was saying that whenever they talked to them
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.780]   They were not talking about how to better support windows
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.460]   They were talking about how to make
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:21.460]   Unnecessary features that were exclusive to intel that amt couldn't offer like just for optical reasons
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.620]   And that led them and they didn't care about graphics
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:29.460]   I thought the cpu would be fast enough that they'd never have to worry about graphics meanwhile the other companies were investing heavily in graphics
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.580]   Yeah, it didn't take probably both accurate
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:38.980]   You know, I'm not they're not mutually exclusive. No totally tell really was you know said x86. That's it
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:42.820]   We're gonna we're all in on x86 and that ultimately didn't
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.460]   Saw that amd64 code
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.940]   I think they're I think that they're also just really challenged to try to keep up with more slaw
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.260]   I mean they just you know at some point they
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:58.260]   Aren't able to and they just had so many delays. I mean that I think the delays are I think are big reason that apple is
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:07.220]   Probably gonna go down its own path as usual the last paragraph in ben's articles are always the ones to pay attention to man
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:14.180]   Basically, he's saying this this is what makes disruption so devastating absent a crisis
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:18.580]   It's almost impossible to avoid disruption managers are paid to leverage their advantages
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.180]   Not destroy them to increase margins not to obliterate them
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.940]   Culture is an organization's greatest asset right up until it becomes its curse
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:32.500]   And he says that's what's happening until and that may well be but it does you know
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.380]   That's I think why when you when apple and microsoft both say arm processors
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.900]   Uh in in microsoft's case designed by other companies and apple's case designed by internally
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.100]   The are the future for our desktop systems
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.700]   Boy, that's a bad that's bad news for intel. Yeah
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:56.900]   It it points to how we're just changing the definition of what a desktop computer is that we're going back to a distributed model
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.460]   We're so what we're so much of the processing power of the apps that we use is actually being done by a server
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.380]   Whether we're in an office environment or not
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.020]   So this is not something that anybody could have bet on five years or five years out
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:14.420]   So it is a cautionary tale for apple though because apple could potentially have the same problem any company that's massively successful
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:20.500]   With a single product can have a problem apple has been good so far like they're the old saying is that you never want to mistake your product for your
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.860]   Business, which is what did steve bomber in because everything had to be windows
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:27.780]   Right it didn't have to be software and apple was like we're not an i we're not a mac company
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.820]   We're not an ipod company
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.540]   We're not even an iphone company if we can make something that kills them
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.860]   Let's us be the one that killed them and and look what they've done with services over the last few years
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.420]   That's clearly going to be a big growth growth center apple apple news
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.380]   I mean, they haven't integrated texture yet, but they're just launching their
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:49.220]   election hub where they like ai is not the complete answer you have to have ai balanced by humans because
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   Yeah, it's gonna feed you good junk food and humans have to make sure you get your vegetable
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:58.180]   That's actually one of our stories the news app is gonna have a mid-terms election tab, which I think is really dangerous
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:05.380]   I think so i'll take a handful of editors and say we're gonna now feed you what you what you want about an election puts them squarely in the
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.940]   Oh boy in the uh, I mean, I just think that is so
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:13.860]   It's curated it's curated ai so the ai pulls out a lot of stuff that interests you and then the editors try to service
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.980]   Having spotlight issues having human editors
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:23.540]   Picking political news that is won't be distributed is a very very dangerous thing to do
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.100]   Like I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot poll
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.580]   We are we already have that happening at the New York Times the Boston Globe at the San Jose, America, renews
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.660]   That's that's basically what newspapers are all about
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:38.980]   I think that we're giving people consumers of journalism choose choices between different products
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:45.540]   I think that it's google's method is reassuring because it says look this is not being touched by human hands
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.020]   We are not trying to influence you by
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:55.380]   By any human beings here saying that we want to make sure that if someone if there's a really really popular trending article on
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.580]   On why on how horrible it is to separate immigrant children's from there and from their parents
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:05.940]   We got to make sure that we have we probably be post justice prominently a counter argument saying oh, well
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.940]   This is just what people deserve
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.900]   Uh, they can fall back on saying look we are happy we have algorithms
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.700]   I simply say that might be flawed in their own way
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:19.300]   But there is no button's personal agenda trying to go in your way apples apples way of having some curation
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.740]   You can't uh, uh, machine learning is the product of human learning once removed
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:30.180]   So you can't you can't avoid some kind of bias and sometimes it really you really do need somebody
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:35.220]   Uh at the end of that assembly line to make sure that there are no like nail filings
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:39.860]   Inside the twinkies before they get wrapped in ship. I mean that's what's been happening with news a lot
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.860]   I do have to say that
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:46.500]   Tell me if it's just me because i'm looking at the new apple news. This is part of iOS 12
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.540]   In the for you section they apparently think
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.180]   I am interested in the doogers
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.300]   In a breastfeeding mom a teen's murder. This is all crap that I don't want to see
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:04.660]   In for you. And then another thing that bothers me is these giant banner ads which apple apparently can't sell because they're all
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.180]   Uh for animal shelter an animal shelter right now
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:15.140]   But are these gonna end up being so two problems I see right now and maybe this is just because it's the beta
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.260]   This is the new browse section on the side on the ipad
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.660]   Uh is that this is not for me. This is absolutely not for me
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.860]   And
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.300]   Is apple gonna start selling giant banner ads into this and if they are
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:33.380]   How are they gonna sell it without tracking my usage? That's how you sell this they have a they have a poly
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.220]   So they've been doing those ads. I think for two a year or two years
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.700]   They made them available and it's similar to the there's you can go read their privacy statement
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:47.140]   They do some level of tracking for it and it persists for a certain amount of time
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.820]   I forget the details because apple is not competitive if they can't meet
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.460]   Google and facebook's offers of
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   Information about what people are buying nobody's gonna buy an ad in apple news if they can buy it in facebook and google
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.460]   Unless they can show volume
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:04.020]   Uh, there is this merit. It's not I don't call it meritory
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.940]   There is this model of brand advertising that a lot of podcast ads use where they you know
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.180]   They they give up on some tracking because they know that yeah like the class example is like web companies
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.860]   They may know you don't need a website today
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.700]   But they want you to remember their name when you do need a website and sam's lung is famous for this
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.740]   They wallpaper airports because they know you're not buying a phone today
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.940]   But when you walk into the carrier they want sam's lung to be the only name
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:27.620]   So that's who buys network television because you can't really yeah, yeah, right
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:31.380]   Yeah, and apple is doing they are doing tracking like they have disclosed that it's in their privacy page
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:34.500]   I forget the details, but they will do but I think it's like location based
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:38.340]   It'll only serve you ads based on your location and not not very deep stuff
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.220]   The interesting watch and obviously at least in the beta that all they're selling is
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:48.660]   Public service announcements are not selling those those are being given when did you put the beta on that device leo's today?
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:54.580]   Yeah, or yes last night. Yeah, it might take a while to actually if you start liking ads
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.660]   Maybe it's not at sorry liking articles. It'll start understanding your tape
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.620]   So you think it's not using the information it got previously
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.340]   No, they're very good at walling
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.980]   See, I don't know how much it translates they wall news off from other stuff
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:13.700]   No, because it knows in the it knows what I've following it has the following information from my previous setup
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:18.660]   It all be working yet. Yeah, it may not be working yet. It's pretty bad
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.900]   It was why I stopped using in the first place because I was getting a lot of crap in there
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:26.020]   Maybe there was that thing at the keynote where Craig goes and you know the section for you
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.860]   And he looks at when the articles goes not not really for me and then it keeps going well and the problem is
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:34.020]   I'm probably exacerbating it because I'm getting this gossip in here
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:37.700]   And so I'm clicking on it and then it goes saying we did pick the right thing for you
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.500]   But I don't really want to I mean of the of the articles is suggesting for me
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.540]   Four of them are from people magazine, which I don't ever read and is not in my list of
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:52.740]   Followed so if you like some articles you do like you do actually want to see more of it just start kicking in
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:58.820]   Yeah, I don't really want to read about the science behind happy relationships from time magazine
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.820]   Seven paid iphone apps on sale for free right now probably won't read that
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:09.300]   Russian pop star who range trump tower meeting makes music not interested you can probably um you could play hate them
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.460]   I don't think I wish I could hate them if I could
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:16.100]   Stuff I would but you know I have to open it to do either of those
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.740]   I have this other pet peeve is that they're inconsistent with what like there's a hard icon a bookmark
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.100]   Oh, yeah, there is a all right. There is an unhearted like they mean book
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:28.100]   They mean different things in different apple apps. Unfortunately you have to unheart it
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:33.540]   Sussan or iTunes which is a nice with iTunes and apple music which annoys the hell out of me
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:39.620]   But what annoys me what other thing that annoys me is that they've decided to express the apple news app
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.100]   in the in the beta of
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:44.420]   of new Mac OS as
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.300]   a
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.220]   Translated version of the iOS app
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:54.180]   Which a is problematic because it feels like an iOS app that's been ported to macintosh as opposed to a mac app
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:01.700]   But secondly that a new zap is the absolute gold standard for why are you even bothering to produce a desktop app at all?
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:07.220]   Why are you why aren't you right? Why aren't you doing this as a webpage because again the because the mac has
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.540]   Worldwide about 9% of desktops in the world
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.380]   It's not foolish to think that someone has a windows machine but an iphone
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:21.780]   Or has an ipad in addition to whatever it is they're using and it really does diminish the reach of apple news
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:27.380]   Which is it continues to be a developing and very exciting news product by limiting it to once again
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.060]   You have to own something with an apple logo on it in order to get your news from us
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:37.540]   That's kind of and you have to live in one of the three original launch countries because even though apple could put apple music in a hundred and fifteen countries at launch
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:42.020]   Google can put news in a hundred and twenty seven countries and microsoft can put it in so many countries
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.260]   It can't count them all we've still only got four years later three countries for apple
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:52.820]   It's a much bigger. I think that have a even bigger problem like launching it in turkey say and other countries
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:57.460]   It's there there are a lot of dimensions to this problem. I'm kind of surprised that they haven't done some kind of
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.660]   Playlist thing with with news my whole thing is is that I articles that are longer than a little bit
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.220]   I won't read the whole thing goes go as soony words and so
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.300]   the
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:13.540]   I just want them to read them to me and so I go through like a little bit of a jumping jack thing to create audio files out of everybody's
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.060]   Articles so I can listen to them all working. I can't believe you just can't say okay
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.380]   I want these ten read articles read them to me
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.820]   They used to do you know there's a there's that app I saw it dubbed up the guy made an app
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:26.500]   That's what I was talking about where he went off to the island and then made an app to his kids
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.660]   Yeah, now he's work floated
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:33.060]   Workflow no I use workflow for it, but I'm just saying I can't believe it's just not built into news where I just want to like
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.540]   Let me just stack up a whole bunch of these things with serious suggestions. You could create a workflow
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.700]   I'm gonna work on it. You say you know hey slo-mo read me my top 10 stories
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.780]   Well, I don't yeah what I want that be awesome. I just want to be able to select them for a listen
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.020]   Oh, I see like I want to go through the news
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.020]   I just go listen to my hand
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.580]   See my NPR app my old NPR app without NPR is like you just select
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.620]   I'll get the name for you, but there was that app at dub dub where you you basically just started reading your safari reading list to you
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.940]   So you just you just I want to say that I don't know what that happens, but I would love it
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:09.540]   You said you read it to your English. We'll find it before I would love news like it took forever to come to the Mac
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:14.340]   It's still not on Apple TV. Just give me all the videos from the news app and news for Apple TV
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:20.180]   Just but make it a system level service. I think I just I think my problem for news is I really like news to be there
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.700]   I don't like to mono task news. So I I like to multitask news
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.420]   So I like to listen to the news while I'm doing something else like I'm you know
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.740]   I'm not really willing to spend a lot of dedicated time on it
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.580]   So the idea of being what converted to audio means I can clean my office or yeah
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:39.380]   Do whatever while I'm while I'm absorbing information. Why is Apple's airpower wireless charger taking so long to make ask mark
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:41.140]   german because it's hard
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:43.220]   But is it really hard? Oh, yeah
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.140]   With the way they're doing it. No, no, I have multi-coil cheap charging pads. It could do multiple devices
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.020]   Oh, it's the watch wasn't on there. It would be easier
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.820]   It's the watch because the watch isn't really cheap. You can't just put it on a key charger
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:02.020]   So that's what's making it hard to watch in any of those locations in the phone and any of those locations
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.260]   Which is multiple different kinds
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.340]   Of I get it. I think I've had pads for years. I had a pad that had four
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.900]   Coil you know for charging spots
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:17.620]   Five years ago. I think the fundamental problem is is that apple repeatedly is having this issue where we're gonna announce something that is
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.620]   Not gonna take a long time like it just you might you know, and they're trying to do in that
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:27.060]   I think they're trying to stay ahead of they're trying to stay ahead of some market segments like for instance not an
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:29.300]   not announcing
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:36.180]   The speaker would was gonna continue to seed market share to google and amazon and a decision process
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:38.740]   You know and like my kids don't at this point
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.700]   They have no idea how to talk to my speak my apple speaker
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.740]   My home pod, but they they talk to Alexa
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:50.980]   Constantly don't they so what kind of charging is in a watch? It's not cheap charging. What is it?
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.740]   It's similar it has a cheap element, but it also has a magnetic element to it
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:59.060]   You need both of those and you also have to manage the current between an iPhone to quick charge it
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.020]   And something like an AirPods, which requires much less right?
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.660]   So they have to make an AirPods case
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.060]   Yes, the AirPods as far as I know that part is done
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:12.820]   It's just making sure that the complexity of the underlying pads will do what they're supposed to do what the amount they're supposed to do it
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:17.300]   Regardless of worry because it shouldn't be your problem where you put it so regardless of where you're placed at our
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.980]   Yeah, and also like I think that for Alex this point
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.900]   They wanted to they wanted to get this up, but they also I think they wanted to show a multi-year commitment
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.900]   To cheat technology because part of them coming on board was to evangelize it so that it would be in every Starbucks and every uber
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.220]   And that really doesn't work
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:38.500]   And to and to by the way, so in irc synapse said, you know, this is a non-problem to people really need wireless charging
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:43.060]   I will admit that I wish that I could plug my watch in I use a lot of different phones
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.900]   I use a lot of different phones
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:50.660]   And uh, I noticed that I don't use the phones that don't wirelessly charges as much because I it's just more convenient for me to
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.140]   I have wireless chargers at home in my home office
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.940]   My desk here in the studio and one might be next to my bed. I use those easels
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.700]   So it's not an issue of placement. It's very quick and easy. I just put it on the easel
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.140]   And for me, that's a really important feature in a phone. Maybe also better
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:09.220]   Security alone in that if you go to a restaurant and I want to plug you to us be
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.940]   Yeah, you don't want to plug into an uber if you're in a summer that guys would break
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.860]   Because you don't know where that like you don't want to like you
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:18.340]   But if you just put it down on the arm rest and it starts charging you put it down in the starbucks and it starts charging
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:22.180]   Well, I won't I won't plug into any public usb connection
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:25.460]   So you see the village right now, maybe not at home not home
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.940]   But as you're walking around if you could put stuff on on
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:34.020]   Tables and stuff and have a charge. Yeah every bar. I don't know why every bar doesn't have this because they don't want you staying
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.980]   They do the more you stay the more you drink you've gone the wrong bars my friend
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:44.580]   What is denny's you're gonna you're gonna if you if you knew for a fact that after a four-hour bender
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.060]   You would be able to call an uber and leave your car by you would make it a six-hour bender
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.940]   So that's a that's a good that's a good product, but that that's exact
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.580]   I'm when I was when there was the first rumblings that apple is gonna go to wireless charging
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:02.580]   My fear was that apple would try to quote improve on quote wireless charging by coming up with their own standard
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:06.660]   But it's sometimes the most important thing is to make this as dumb as possible
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.860]   So that someone can't afford to have a 15 or 20 dollar
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:14.340]   Charging pad on their desk another one like near their sofa another one
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.180]   In the kitchen so that no matter where they go when they set their phone down
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.740]   They can actually be topping off their battery at that same time
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:26.500]   So they're doing a lot of new things with this new charging pad that go beyond simply being a three-station charger
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.820]   And that is that's part of what's getting this making making problems
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:34.740]   It's it's easy to get things working 90 percent. It's very hard to get something working 100
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.620]   As our earlier story about that keyboard
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.780]   Kind of pointed out
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:44.900]   So let's see if it pays off once they actually ship it and they're gonna share it back with cheatay said whatever
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.900]   They whatever they add to this tech good
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:51.060]   Did you get your uh, have you stocked up on your modern buckles
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:57.300]   Renee no because they're for the 38 millimeter. I have a 40. Oh, they don't have modern buckles for the 42
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:00.980]   No, I don't understand why because apple is so good about being gender inclusive
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:05.380]   They don't have the the rate they don't have the loop for the 38. They don't have the modern buckle
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:08.900]   Oh, well apparently they're just continuing the modern buckle. Yeah
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.420]   So if you didn't get one, but I didn't realize it's 38 only
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:16.100]   Uh, I just didn't buy it because it was too damn expensive. Yeah
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.300]   When I saw 149 bucks. I didn't even look at what sizes I just like never mind
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.740]   Never mind
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.740]   Uh, let's see
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:32.740]   Do do do apple has ordered more series do we want to do the i'm not gonna do the 2019 rumors
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:37.700]   I don't care about 2019 rumors even if they come from mark german. It's 2019 folks
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:44.660]   For those things of 2019. There's no such thing there shouldn't be apple's ordered a series called little america
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:49.060]   from allen yang the star the stars of the big sick and the office is lee isenberg
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   uh, this is actually great of course because uh, uh,
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:58.500]   kamal and johnmy on johnmy is uh has an immigrant experience he talks about it a lot
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:04.820]   The big sick was a lot about his his pakistani family and how they didn't want him to marry marry an american, etc, etc
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:11.620]   Uh, these will be stories about the immigrant uh immigrants in america and I think that's a great idea for a series
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.780]   Well, we still don't know
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.780]   Where the hell these things are gonna show up
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.740]   So
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:19.540]   One more
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.020]   It's a long list of shows now that they've ordered
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:25.140]   You think tv.app?
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:26.020]   Yep
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:30.900]   It does seem like they're they are leaning towards, you know, obviously tent poles, but all and it's not like they're all
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.900]   You know and and all sorts of things that are culturally rich, you know, whether it's opre or you know
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.700]   She's gonna. Opus great. This one is going to be fantastic
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.060]   They're i think they're trying to do something that's more meaningful and not trying to shotgun
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.540]   You know, they don't
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:47.780]   Yeah, well also they they know that they can't win with a strategy of let's fun
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.820]   Let's fund the next game of thrones game of thrones costs
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:56.500]   Fortune the to produce and what if people just don't like it not everything is going to be a west world
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:00.820]   Uh, walking dead almost the same as apple's entire budget
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.300]   Just to acquire
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.300]   The lord of the rain
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.300]   Not to produce it just to buy the rights to it
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:11.780]   So apple does have to pick and choose and you only have a you only have a billion dollars to spend
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:18.820]   Also, there also there there i think their goal right now is not to challenge netflix or hulu or anybody like that
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:23.060]   But to simply make the tv app a lot more credible as a destination
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:26.420]   Um, like i was saying last week i think that there i i feel is though
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:33.140]   One a smart goal for them would be to make sure that instead of the your landing page for apple tv being
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.180]   this grid of icons in which tv has
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:43.220]   Equanimity with every single thing else. It's just the place you apple tv is just the remote you pick up in order to navigate to netflix
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:47.620]   Now when you in the future when you take it when you launch the apple tv
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:53.380]   You'll get on you'll get into the tv app that will have here's all the exclusive stuff that we've got on apple tv
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.780]   And scroll scroll scroll scroll here's netflix
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.020]   And if you want to hold down and make it jiggle and then move the netflix app someplace else you can do that
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.740]   But netflix is a door way off of this main hall. We have original apple content
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:08.100]   So they can spit they can afford to spend time developing a nice portfolio
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:15.780]   Because if they have a five-year plan five years is a long time to acquire a really nice portfolio of at least 12 important series
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.940]   And i think i think that if they
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:21.460]   With all the other advantages that they have if they are able to
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:28.900]   Incorporate this in with what you're already paying for for apple music i think that it becomes very competitive
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:32.100]   You know and in difficult, you know, there's a lot of places there where they can
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:37.060]   um, you know keep on leveraging those those two pieces together to to add a lot of bang for your buck
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.060]   Yeah, yeah, uh, I don't know
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:46.980]   Yet what the upshot of this is of course, we're in a trade war with china right now
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.140]   um
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.740]   In the past the white house has said it's not going to affect the iphone
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:58.900]   Uh on the other hand when you want a 250 billion dollars in tariffs from china
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.380]   Uh, it almost has to affect
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:05.860]   Can guarantee if you're if you're gonna say anything definitive about this then i just gonna assume you don't know what you're talking about
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:09.140]   Yeah, China's not China does not they do what they want to do
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:15.860]   Yeah, or you can guarantee anything so i mean this is that's 250 billion dollars is half of all us trade with china
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.420]   Uh, so that means trade sort of affect a lot of things will they will iphones cost more? I don't know
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:26.740]   I think a lot a lot of people were wondering you know like why is tim cook, you know sitting in these round tables and why is why is he there?
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.260]   Is because you do not want to be left out of that conversation because that that could be you know
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.260]   That's probably worth billions of dollars to apple to to be at least involved in the conversation
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.700]   doesn't even mean he has to
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:40.260]   Agree with everything but being willing to show up at the white house and having those conversations. I think was
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:46.580]   Probably useful if he had just ignored him and ignored all those things i guarantee the iphone would be on on the shortlist
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:54.260]   Well, and then we should also point out that moving iphone production to the us wouldn't necessarily solve the problem either because components are also being
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:58.980]   Turfed well even if even if they could the components are being there so it wouldn't necessarily solve
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:05.620]   I would help you but i'm a national security threat so i'm just well basically i'm coming to visit you to buy my next iphone
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.060]   If you guys would just stop with the softwoods
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.100]   Well, the irony is is there people are talking about having to move
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:16.900]   Finish the production that was being done in the united states in china because because
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.780]   Harley jimmison's moving to the europe because
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.700]   Yeah
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:25.460]   It's not a good if you know it's a basically we're not taking a beaver it's on
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:31.140]   Yeah, no, I don't want beaver. I don't want beaver you can have him but that's a good deal. That's a fair. We're keeping shatner
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.700]   We're keeping shatner you can keep deeper guy
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.500]   Uh, I there's not much to say about that except that you know
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.380]   We'll continue to watch with interest because it could very well affect apples business dramatically
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:49.700]   Uh, just it's unknown which ultimately will affect everybody we tend to we tend to forget how that affects everybody
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.260]   And it may not happen at all because uh, you know, they may it's
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.780]   Resolve
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.060]   There was this whole there was this old thing saying you never want you never like
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.380]   I forget I think it was china and the china straight
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:05.460]   You just never want two ships to come close together because someone might accidentally fire
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.700]   It doesn't matter if they don't this time, but at some point it'll happen
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:10.740]   So you just don't want these situations happening because at some point someone
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:14.260]   Intentionally you're not will slip on a trigger and then everybody is at war
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.820]   So just keep away from all this stuff
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.260]   Sorry
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.260]   I just say we
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:27.140]   Yeah, exactly you you thought it'd be funny 11 years ago to steal that shop with that zagnot
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.140]   Go bar from the seven from the 7/11
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.660]   Now that's your that's your ability to do business the united states my friend
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:36.260]   Hey, you said tv.app with such confidence
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:41.940]   Earlier when you're talking about content rene has if you learned something that we should know
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:46.260]   No, I think I think apple is just busy. I think a lot of stuff with apple
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.740]   Um, you know, like there are rumors of course and you hear things
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:53.860]   But if you follow the the short arc of their history, they do very rational very sensible things
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.820]   Often when you look back and I said you go, yeah, you know, that was the best option for them to take
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.020]   So I think a lot of times if you just look at what they can do with things
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.500]   They will choose the most sensible thing to do with it
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:09.460]   And they I don't think they spent all this time building up tv.app and putting all the content and getting it all there
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:13.620]   To then try to hide um apple media projects and some other I agree. I will
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.900]   I will just say that the disney has its own
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.820]   App, you know coming out that's its own streaming service is coming on 2019
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:25.700]   Which perfectly packages it up to be bought by apple and then they just take that apple
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.580]   Yeah
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.580]   The letter
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.460]   Dc has a streaming thing coming out and w everyone is going to have a streaming apple is going to have
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:39.620]   magazine subscription TV subscription and music subscription. I want my bundles back
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:45.620]   Well, that was the only company that could that could buy a company that would give the marvel star wars
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:50.900]   Nat Geo, you know like like the gamut of all the things that make sense for apple would all be in
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:54.260]   I think all in case in one company and you just kind of know that they buy lego
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:57.140]   They will own my entire childhood. I do admire apples
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:03.380]   I think intelligent decision not to try to swallow giant companies because the culture of shock
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.500]   I think that's really what's going on
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.020]   Exactly
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:15.300]   And also the the the media consolidation is going to affect apple and every other company that this is this is why apple developing its own
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.860]   Content is almost not only a smart move
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:24.980]   It's almost a survival mood move because whatever deal you make with whatever existing company because you want to have access to their content library
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:30.660]   They could be bought by another another company soon that will simply say we are no longer going to be offering this
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:36.820]   Cable companies have an obligation to make sure that i'm sorry cable channels have an obligation to
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:41.940]   Make their content available to other cable operators even if they're owned themselves by a cable company
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:48.900]   But those restrictions do not apply to streaming so it would be possible for disney once they feel as though they have a good enough
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:57.300]   Library of content to simply say guess what no disney or disney affiliated product service property will ever be available in any other streaming service
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.620]   Except for this new disney service that we're opening right now
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:05.860]   And so now guess what nobody has unless unless apple wants to buy sony's content and no one has bought sony yet
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:11.700]   Apple could be left with we've got to we've got to have our own game of thrones. We have to produce our own movies
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:17.140]   Not just because we want to have something that's unique to us but because we want to have content period
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:23.140]   I think there's no company that I know it's a huge thing and I know it doesn't it doesn't make any sense from the size perspective
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:28.260]   But there is no company with content that is more that makes more sense for apple than than disney the rest of them
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.660]   You look at all the other options they throw out there you're like wow
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.140]   But that's been true for a while and the fact that engineers have bought them yet kind of tells me
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:40.020]   They would have to restructure there they would have to do like an alphabet style restructuring their company
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:46.500]   In order to buy a company like disney because it just that does I don't think that company could possibly function
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:51.860]   As a vice presidency under tim cook or on any under any apple ceo
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:57.700]   Could apple could alex run it could apple just buy it and let alex run it. Yeah, right? That's a solution now
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:01.540]   There is an idea file maker file maker, but disney and alex can run it
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:04.900]   Let's take a break your picks gentlemen fire them up
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.620]   They're coming up next
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.900]   Meanwhile, I'm glad we've got our molecule fired up here in the studio
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.100]   Molecule is a miracle for us
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:19.380]   Anybody with allergies anybody who's been sneezing asthma
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:24.500]   The molecule is a new a breakthrough really air filtration system
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:29.940]   It's capable of destroying air pollutants at the molecular level hence the name lm OLE k u le
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.340]   It was replacing something that's essentially 50 years old the hepa filter
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.140]   Actually more than 50 years old people have been using a hepa filter since the 40s
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:42.900]   But it but it doesn't do the job you want the hepa filter
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:54.500]   Cannot capture and eliminate allergens mold bacteria viruses even airborne chemicals only molecules pico technology can it's the photo electro chemical oxidation
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.020]   Peco
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:01.940]   And it includes pollutants 1000 times smaller than those a hepa filter can catch
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.420]   uh funded by the epa
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:09.140]   Tested by people like me and who love it and verify by third parties
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:13.620]   In university labs like the university of south florida's center for biological defense
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:20.740]   And the university of minnesota's particle calibration laboratory molecule makes it easier to cope with asthma and allergies
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:25.300]   Significantly reduces symptoms kills odors. We have a molecule in the studio
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:33.460]   We we put one in here because after the fires with all the smoke and then people do tar on the roof and then people painting and pretty soon
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:40.580]   You know, but it smells good in here, right? And we got the molecule at home. I've got one for lisa because she has allergies and
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:47.780]   She stopped it. It changed her life. She stopped waking up with headaches. It's also beautiful. It's like the apple of air purifiers
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:50.500]   a sleek aluminum shell
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.900]   It uh you can use it manually of course if you don't want to connect it to the internet
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:00.660]   But if you do connect it to the internet it will automatically order filters for you when you need them, which I really like
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.660]   Um, but you don't have to some people don't want to have another iot device. It doesn't have to be
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.260]   It's not required at all. It's got a button right on the top you can turn it on
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.220]   You can run it in silent mode. That's how we run it here in the studio
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:21.540]   You can run it maximize boost mode that clears out smoke and gas and odors and even stuff you can't see almost instantaneously
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.700]   It really is
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.540]   an amazing solution
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.140]   If you're looking for an air filtration system that actually works
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.900]   Molecule you can get 75 dollars off your first order if you go to mole
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:42.020]   K u le dot com and use a promo code mac break they have literally
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:46.980]   Reinvented the air purifier. It does it destroys
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:50.180]   destroys impurities in the air
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:56.340]   I love it molecule dot com mole k u le dot com and don't forget them
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.740]   offer code mac break
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:03.700]   Because you'll save 75 bucks and then they'll know you heard about it here on mac break. So help support the show. Thank you
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:09.460]   Molecule dot com and they do have a money back guarantee if you're at all nervous about it, but I have to say
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.020]   Uh
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:14.020]   We like it so much. We have three now
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:19.860]   So i'm a believer. We have one in michaels room. We have one in our bedroom and then we have one here in the studio
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:22.660]   Renee richy pick of the week my friend
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.220]   So the the app that wouldn't die a pokemon go leo i'm going back to that again
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:32.340]   They've put out another big update and they've had another huge wave of engagement
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:34.660]   So now you have
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:38.740]   You have friendship so you can make friends with people and then they will send you gifts
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:42.980]   You can send them gifts i'm gonna open a gift right now. Can I be friends with you or does it have to be something nearby?
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:45.700]   No, you can be totally be friends with me
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:50.820]   You open it up. I have to manage items now because I have too many things. I'll quickly delete something. Yay
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.940]   Um, you haven't bought the giant backpack yet. I did and i'm still a lot of
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:01.140]   So you it'll give you a bunch of stuff and it'll even give you eggs for a lowland pokemon
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:03.300]   Which are essentially the hawaiian pokemon versions
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.780]   Uh, so they have like different types
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:11.780]   Uh, and also you can do trading now. So if I have a pokemon you want you have a pokemon I want as long as we're close enough together
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.260]   We can trade those and the further apart we caught them the more we get for trading them
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:22.100]   Uh, so there's oh and there's so the gift is where the new mechanics are friendship gifting and trading
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:25.380]   And it's it's a lot of fun. They said they want to really increase
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.380]   The social they want to make it the most social game ever which you know, it's just typical hyper
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:33.860]   Hyperbole, but they're really executing on a bunch of interesting features and they give you more stuff to do
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:39.540]   And the greater your friendship level the greater bonuses you get in attacking gyms or doing raids together
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:44.740]   It's it's it's been a lot of fun and i'm i'm actually playing a lot more again
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:48.420]   I know
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:49.700]   They keep sucking me
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:54.020]   So what i'm waiting for though is there's rumors are going to do a player versus player mode and I figured
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:57.700]   What better way to do that than ar kit too with multiplayer?
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:05.460]   So you're all sharing the same view as your pokemon are battling and that would be a pretty really good tech demo for ar kit too
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:12.020]   Oh, I hope I catch this. Oh, wow. I can do you oh the damn rosy. You broke free. Oh
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:17.940]   I love that rose. I want that rosy. Yeah be my first catch of the day and i'm brand new pokemon too
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:22.020]   I'm gonna get all sorts extra bonus points. Yeah, and if i but she's tough
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:26.020]   You could use you could use a great baller and i'll show you I use a little uh brazberry honor
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:30.740]   Yeah, yeah, there's a razberry slower down now. She loves me
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.540]   I don't want I don't like to use those fancy balls there. I think I got her that time
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:41.780]   Might have you might have so where's the friend stuff because i'd like to so I could trade I could because you're far away
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.060]   That's so good. Oh totally. So if you go to um
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:49.700]   I'll put it on like that 1,100 experience points buddy
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:53.860]   If you tap on ad friend it gives you a unique number that's mine
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:59.140]   So anybody who types that number into their into their pokemon can can ask to be my friend
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.700]   You have a way to refuse wait a minute. Wait a minute. So where do I do that in the in the in the
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:08.900]   You go to your friend. So I see I don't I oh I don't have any friends. You're gonna be my first
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:15.860]   Okay, I am at 9 5 6 0 9 0 8 1
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.980]   7 0 3 9
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.780]   There you go. Okay. I just sent you a request rene
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:26.260]   I will approve it as soon as I get it. It's and it said your name and mine is 3068
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:32.660]   5 8 0 2 0 0 7 9 and i'll approve anybody go ahead show that so everybody could see it
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.820]   I want to show it on the screen. There you go
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:40.820]   Be my buddy. You do have a limit of 200 friends and the interesting thing is they introduced this over the weekend
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:45.300]   They started with level 40 players and they went slowly down now you have to be level 10 or above
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:48.500]   But their servers were crashing again. There were so many people coming back to play
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:52.500]   And it was take it which is basically a google's engine taking down all the servers again
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:57.700]   You could be my first friend. So as soon as I get it. I will approve it. Oh, but wait a minute

[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.540]   You know it started because the
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:26.660]   Way new i i ended up walking i think an hour and a half two days ago and an hour yesterday and i want to hatch all the new eggs
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:32.420]   That's what i love this motivation rene has caught 44,525 pokemon
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:36.100]   I'm busy two years and he's got his own ho
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.300]   Yes, shiny shiny ho
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.620]   Which one are you are you are you one of these karsten? No, I
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:49.460]   Only got half your code. Oh, let me show you my code again. Yeah, show me your everybody should know my code
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:56.420]   How do I do that again? Just click the go to your ad friend button. Yeah friend. There you go. You're 3068
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:59.300]   5802
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.380]   0079. I'm sorry. We're slowing the showdown. No, this is the show
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:07.780]   All right, it's into a friend Alex lindsey
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:11.860]   You must have a pick of the week for us. So i've had this issue
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.060]   I have a lot of issues, but I have a specific issue
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:21.540]   Which is that I shoot stuff with my in portrait mode on my phone, but I can't edit it on my computer
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:28.180]   You can't you don't have the full control of like changing all the depth of field and playing around with it and noodle
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:32.100]   Because vertical video should be banned from the world. No, no, no, i'm just taking portrait
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.380]   Portrait still stills, you know, like the portrait mode and you can't edit them
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:41.460]   Not there's not a lot of tools to do it very well. So i've been playing with this anamorphic pro which is does that
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.420]   So basically it takes in you can basically export
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:47.620]   your heic
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:49.780]   File
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:55.140]   So you save that out as a as a as an original and then you bring it in here and it grabs onto that depth map
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:59.620]   And now you can do all the things that you do with something like focus, you know, which is that you can
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:06.260]   actually, you know, adjust the depth of field and play with it. You can also it has a lot of like
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:12.980]   You can play with brightness and exposure and it has some pre settings and you can sharpen things in the foreground
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.220]   And you know, there's a lot of other things that you can do with it, but it's um, it's a slick little app
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:19.860]   It's not very expensive. I think it's like 30 bucks or something like that
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:25.780]   But it lets you if you've been if it's something that you want to be able to do on your computer
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:29.540]   That's after you, you know, you can of course do this in something like focus
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:32.660]   But sometimes you you have your computer opening to it there
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:39.700]   Now i'm kind of surprised you can't have all these both vocuses control as well as this control in photo
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.420]   Uh, or in photos, but but since you can't
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.100]   Um, if this is something you feel is missing for you. This is the right app
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.940]   So anyway, it's it's a cool. And if you don't know what Alex just said, it's not for you
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:52.740]   It's not for you if you're not worried about changing your depth of field based on
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:56.740]   I don't know if this would help you Alex, but in iOS 12 is along with the depth data
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:01.300]   They'll now also give you their segmentation mat as an api as an api
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:04.340]   I'm just saying if you if you want an app that that lets you
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.420]   Uh
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:09.220]   If you want an app that that lets you do the things that you want to do
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.500]   Um
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:17.380]   But you're being you could now access but you being you could now access the segmentation mat as well and do all your Alex things with it
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:19.860]   I'm the thought has caused my mind
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.660]   But i'm just saying that that this is the app that does it now
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:29.540]   I just got 10 more friends. I don't have any friends. I don't have 15 friends
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:35.460]   Oh, i'm sorry
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:37.460]   That was it
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:39.540]   Andy and i go pick of the week
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:41.060]   I don't need friends
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:47.060]   I got my books and because i'm home on friday and saturday night and sunday night and monday tuesday wednesday
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:53.060]   I can read read read read read with my friends in the elephant kingdom. Are you jealous?
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.620]   Babar
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:56.660]   him too
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:00.740]   Uh, there's a i there's a sometimes there's an app that i've been using for a while
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:04.420]   But have been forgetting to recommend because i figure that everyone else knows about it
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.460]   Uh
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:11.060]   If a lot of people are not aware that their local public library will let you borrow ebooks and audiobooks
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:16.580]   And furthermore, you don't have to like go to the library because these are electrons that can be sent to you
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:22.660]   Over the information super highway and there and because libraries are absolutely awesome in every way shape or form
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:27.380]   They really want people if they've got a service they want to make it as easy as possible for you to use that service
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:32.020]   So you can just download essentially a kindle app on your phone that will let you
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:37.700]   Basically assign your your local library card to this app and then
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:42.420]   Sign out books and materials that will you just it ought just a stupel
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:47.060]   Land on your phone and it expires and but in the meantime you get to read the entire book
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:53.060]   The standard app used to be and still is overdrive that most library systems were using last year
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:55.780]   There was a much better excuse me a much more accessible version
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:03.220]   By this makers of the same app called libby that is it really does come across like a kindle app or the iBooks app
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:05.540]   It's very very polished
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.180]   It really is like a very standard
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:14.100]   Fun looking a book reading app that will run on android will run on ios
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:19.300]   In united states libraries you can even use the use the ios app to like to
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:22.820]   Sign out a book, but then have it sent to your kindle reader
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:25.460]   And it will all just work fine
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:30.740]   Some people have multiple library cards like they might have a library card for the town they live in but they also have
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:35.940]   Like a boston public library library card or they go to a college and they also have a college library library card
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:41.860]   Libby one of its unique advantages that you can consolidate all of those cards into this one app
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:45.860]   And so all the books you've signed out everywhere are right here on this one device
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:49.300]   And it's free free free. It's just is just there to help you
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:57.540]   Use all the stuff that that your library lets you use and unlike the it's predecessor or let's say it's partner app overdrive
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:02.340]   It really is more consumer oriented overdrive is never has always been a very good app
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.980]   It's never come across like a hack or anything like that
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:12.100]   But it doesn't it libby feels more like when there is a startup that really wants to corner the market in book publishing and knows
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.620]   It has to be as friendly as possible. Libby is the result not overdrive
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.140]   So definitely download it
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.620]   You might as one of the other nice features of libby is that
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:26.740]   With many libraries if you don't have a library card you can even sign up for a library card automatically and not even again
[01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:30.420]   Having no friends. I have no need to leave the house and challenge the giant day ball
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:37.540]   So you can my local library doesn't I you have to you will have to have an awkward conversation with a social interaction with somebody
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:38.420]   You don't know
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:43.380]   But that's okay because then once they once you get your library card and the numbers punch punched into libby
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:47.780]   Then you can go back to your house and never leave it again because you can just get this constant flow of books
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:51.540]   You never have to pay for it but to sign out so definitely definitely do it
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:58.660]   If no if for no other reason that not only will it give you access to an immense library of really great content that you don't have to
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:03.700]   Excuse me. You're already paying for by living and paying property taxes or taxes in your in your community
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:09.780]   But also it might make you more aware of all the resources that your public library has and they are fantastic
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:13.060]   If you haven't stepped inside a public library in the past five five years
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:19.860]   You might not recognize it and you might be kicking yourself that you have not been taking that two mile walk every now and then
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:26.900]   To just basically use this wonderful community resource and libby is one of the tools that will help you make the most of that resource
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:30.980]   So I can't recommend it highly enough the sandera fell library had a VR
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:35.380]   Night I think or VR afternoon yesterday. I was like wow the yarn
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:39.460]   We can't support our local libraries because they really are great resources and of course
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:46.500]   We all here don't really need libraries and people watching probably don't but there are a lot of people who don't have access to this kind of stuff
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:51.860]   For whom a library is a is a vital resource. And so we really want to let's support
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.460]   I mean you should use it because even it doesn't matter who you are
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:55:01.620]   They've got stuff that you can use as a lot of them are putting are using some of their conference spaces for like for makerspaces
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:05.540]   They're acquiring like 3d printers. So if you want to learn 3d printing
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:09.700]   They're good community centers, but you're absolutely right when they're people who say that oh well
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:13.140]   We should have less less money for libraries because nobody reads books anymore
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:17.380]   That's true, but I I work a lot at my local libraries fortunately
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:19.380]   It's only about the half mile half mile walk away
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:22.500]   It's one of the wonderful things about where I live but every time I'm there
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:29.620]   My favorite place to work is one of the tables that's sort of near where all the public PCs are and that's and whenever I pass by
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.700]   And I can see something on the screen not that I'm looking
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:35.860]   It's basically people who are looking for job assistance or looking for
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:39.940]   Getting on government programs. They don't have they may not have a computer
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:43.860]   They may not have internet access they may not even have an actual fixed address
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:48.580]   But if they can go to the library they can still get their veterans benefits that they're completely entitled to
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.380]   They can still figure out how to get a home loan with government assistance. They can figure out
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.260]   It's such an important community resource that
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:01.860]   One of the it's one of the few statements that a stranger can make to me that will make me immediately judge them
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:05.220]   If they're saying that I don't know why there are other libraries or nobody
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:09.380]   But it's only for old people and they they're already already retired. They don't need a library anyway
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.580]   Why are we paying for it?
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:15.060]   That's I've actually heard people's make statements like that some people in government as a matter of fact
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:19.460]   And that's when I have to that's what turns mr. Hand into mr. Fiss pretty quickly
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.940]   I have to put it into mr. Pocket
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.620]   And I think I think somehow libraries need to get to a point where there are community information centers
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:29.620]   You know rather than being thought of as a collection of books, you know
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.620]   There there's a lot of information that you can learn
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.100]   Interact with and so on so forth
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:37.060]   As opposed to just being I think most of us think of
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:42.340]   Libraries as a book that's what that's what they are. They just don't use the they have they have resources
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:46.020]   Every time they get money they use them into creating more services and resources for the community
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:50.660]   They're not buying bus ads. Unfortunately if more people again just basically made a
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:52.660]   Made it made a
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:56.980]   Just make a list that there's a list of things that you do every time you change the clocks forward or back
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.980]   Because it's a good way to remember it like okay
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:04.980]   I change the clocks back when I'm gonna change the batteries my smoke alarm. I'm gonna clean the filters and my air conditioning system
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:10.580]   I'm also going to visit my public library to see what's changed in the past six months because chances are
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:15.940]   Howard Schultz put a lot put a Starbucks in my library. You'll see a lot more of me
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:21.540]   There is you know there there there is a there is a really wonderful coffee
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.420]   Coffee shop called the newsfeed cafe at the Boston public library
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:30.340]   It's the it's the huge renovation they did of this this horrible brutalist extension
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:32.340]   They made to the beautiful mckin building
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:38.500]   There was built in 1971. It looked as as I was fond of saying it looks like the place where an eastern europe
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:44.660]   You would go to beg a party official for any information about your dissident uncle who disappeared six days ago
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:49.940]   It was that ugly and that intimidating and they've turned the entire thing into it's still a library
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:52.980]   But the entire first floor is like open space with wifi
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:56.020]   Sit down be comfortable do work get a coffee get a cookie
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:59.220]   You can't take the coffee in the cookie and where you want but you can take into a lot of places
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:04.580]   It's also where the radio studio that I occasionally do public radio in is uh, and so it's
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:09.700]   That's beautiful. I think it's I've seen the pictures you've posted. That's a beautiful. That's a great studio

[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:10.980]   Because we exchanged gifts
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.380]   I love you. I would give you more stuff for an a but I don't have anything so I know and the thing is you'll you'll have to do
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:19.780]   One thing a day so you can alternate or you can do a raid together or you can attack a gem together
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:24.100]   I have to say I haven't played pokemon going a long time and they have added a lot of features features
[02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:26.100]   They had talked about adding in the beginning
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.980]   Things like trading stuff and I'm just thrilled. I uh, I am and a lot more
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:36.260]   Play play ability. So I think I'm gonna pick it up again too. Yeah, awesome. Yeah
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:41.620]   It's we by play it in japan. I was hoping I was hoping there'd be some interesting stuff to
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:46.500]   Hi density places are fun. Yeah. Oh, really fun because you just you know, you could stand in one spot
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:49.460]   Raid like they do also now they have a community day
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:54.980]   So for three hours once a month they pick a pokemon like I don't know charmander or the last one was
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:59.860]   Larvatar and they just spawn everywhere and you catch shinies and you go out in groups of people
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:04.900]   They also uh now they give you a weather forecast and some pokemon types
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:09.060]   Are stronger appear more frequently and give bonus stardust when caught
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:14.500]   Uh, been depending on the weather forecast and the weather effects are like I had snow for six months in the game and it was
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:20.980]   It was gorgeous. It kind of rain is amazing. The rain looks really good. Yeah, this is really uh, you know
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:26.500]   I almost want to say it's a shame. They didn't do this right away. I understand why they didn't they barely could keep the thing afloat
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:31.220]   But uh, I hope people do take a look at pokemon and go again because that's pretty cool
[02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:36.020]   Uh, at least it was mad at me when I watched it in japan. She said let's let's not get into that again
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:43.540]   But we but it was fun. It was really fun. All right. Hey, thank you everybody for joining us
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.660]   Thanks to alex scumple for my pick of the week. I was actually going to talk about firefox 661
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:53.220]   That's kind of dull firefox now has uh is going to have data from half
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:57.300]   I've been pwned and one password incorporated into it to help you detect
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:04.500]   Uh risky sites sites, maybe where your password has been leaked things like that. So, um, and I started using it on the mac and it's really nice
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.660]   Maybe a good alternative to chrome. I'm still gonna probably depend on safari more than anything else, but the new firefox
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:13.380]   Um is is great
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:16.580]   They've really uh, I think made a nice open source project
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:20.260]   I moved away from safari for a long time and now i'm finding myself using it
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:22.900]   Well, I think apple wants it to be your choice
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:25.540]   And I think that they're making it better and better in order to do that
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:28.100]   I use it on my laptop because it really does help battery battery
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:31.700]   Right. Yeah, actually there's no reason not to use it on your laptop
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:35.220]   But on your desktop you might want to have more than one choice. You know why I have three browsers on my
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:40.900]   I shouldn't admit this but bloomberg only gives me 10 pages a month per browser
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:42.900]   [laughter]
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:49.060]   So now I get 30 right 30 mark german's once a day. I can look at it. You're not using opera. Oh, it's 40
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.060]   There's 40
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:53.060]   I have no like
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:03:00.020]   You can tell how scared I am about being tracked for the information i'm looking for by what browser I use my my normal one is is chrome
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:06.580]   I'll use safari because I'm concerned about like marketing people's has a little bit more security, but still the same browser
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:10.020]   Then I have tor browser, which is I'm going to be sir
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:13.620]   I'm just curious about how much the how much this house that I just
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:19.940]   Backed by might be selling for I don't want to be on some list of people who are shopping for houses no matter what happens
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:26.660]   Yeah, so that's why I have multiple multiple browser. I think firefox actually is good for anti-tracking as well
[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:31.220]   I think they've got a very good story. They're all getting better. It's nice. Yeah, they all are yeah
