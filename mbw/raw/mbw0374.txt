[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.900]   Time for Mac break weekly the show that covers Apple's announcements
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.720]   obsessively all year round joining me right now Andy and I come from the Chicago Sun times a
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   Baston Red Sox fan he bleeds red wait a minute that makes
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.920]   I guess only only under when the Red Cross technician is a trainee usually when they put the needle in for my donations
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   It's very very there's very little what don't worry about that
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.720]   Hey Andrew congratulations on the bow socks one more one game away. They're going home
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.800]   My contribution was negligible at best. However, I'm glad to do whatever I could have done
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.120]   It's not funny about team sports Renee Richie's also here from imore.com hi Renee
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.600]   Hi, we have no best no baseball left in Montreal. I know it's over. Yep
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.280]   But it is funny how one feels often as a fan that one in some way influences the result I
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.360]   Guess it does in certain football stadiums like Seattle where it's so noisy
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   Actually here anything
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.760]   See that that was my that was my reaction last night that after being really happy that the socks won and so now game six and seven
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.960]   Are deaf are gonna be in that Fenway there? It's always there's I'm a fan of baseball in general not just the socks
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.800]   And I just have to think about oh the Cardinals are gonna have a really special experience
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   Trying to take the world series away from the red Sox in Fenway Park, which is already the most intimate of
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.640]   Ball stadium in the in the in the entire major leagues. I mean if you've ever been there
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   It's like every seat that's if you've been there and any other like any other park that's been built in 20 years
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.880]   You feel like you're at like the sandlot where everybody is like 10 feet away
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.000]   So if they if someone is giving an opposing picture the finger that picture knows exactly what
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.840]   Possible for a player's feelings to get hurt that players feelings are gonna get hurt
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   So I hope that I hope that whatever I don't know how long the bus ride is from Cincinnati
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.880]   Excuse me from I'm sorry from St. Louis the Boston
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.040]   But I hope they spend that bus ride just toughening these players up and realizing that hurtful hurtful things are going to be said
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.680]   That's the thing I love about Fenway and Riggly is that you can actually sit
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.320]   Literally three feet from the on deck circle
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.640]   You can you could you could reach out and touch the on deck batter and that's the those are the only tool fields still to do that obviously
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.120]   But we're not here to talk baseball much as I'd like to
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   Let us hockey time. Let's talk hockey
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.040]   Let us let us talk Apple
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.800]   Lots of stuff to talk about I don't even know where to begin. We're of course one week out from the Apple iPad announcements
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.080]   The MacBook Pro with retina here we go the new I guess there was only one thing I could buy so I bought it
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.760]   The new MacBook Pro with retina
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.920]   Let's start with that because people in the chat room
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   Keep for people somebody in the chat and keeps going in and saying why don't you ever talk about the image retention issue with the MacBook retina?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.920]   Some days it's all we can think about
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.320]   Where would we stop?
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   Honestly chat room that would be the entire 90 minutes and we'd still be all angry and worked up and then it'd be time for the next show
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.920]   I don't know because I don't write with you on this. I don't have it. Is there an image? I have yeah, okay?
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.960]   What is it? I have it so badly that sometimes I think Gruber is trolling me by making daring fireball transparent. Oh, that's bad
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.040]   So what it is is I believe it's the LG and not the Samsung displays you can get two different displays in a MacBook
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.080]   And I don't even think the genius is know which part is coming in when they order it
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.480]   I and on I believe it was the LG display
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.000]   It will it will the image will linger bright areas will linger
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   So if you go to someplace that has daring fireball gray is the best example on it you will see the burn-in from
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   Whatever you had on the screen for a long period of time before that it doesn't last forever and some people it drives crazy
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.680]   It hasn't bothered me enough that I've taken it to the genius bar yet
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.120]   But I absolutely will do and they run a little test and if they can verify it or just take your word for it
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.040]   They'll swap out the display and you can play, you know, uh screen lottery with them. Yeah, because you you don't you still can't say I want
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   An LG or I don't want an LG display. So where would I find first of all is there somewhere in the about this?
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.000]   Back in tasha. I can find what display part I have don't think so and it's not all of the lg's
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.800]   Just a few like the lg's are susceptible to it where the Samsung I don't think are and I might be getting the names mixed up
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.160]   So I apologize to both kangrian korean conglomerates if I am mixing about
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.800]   But yeah, it's just one of those things where it's almost like a lottery and you get a bad one
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.680]   You can take it back until you get one that that really works
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.840]   I will be they fixed it with the second generation the the good news is apple at least acknowledges it and replaces it
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.680]   um
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   The bad news is that that happened at all because it happened last time didn't it we had the same exact issue
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.960]   Oh, I haven't heard about it happening with the second generations yet. I haven't at least not in any large
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.800]   Well, people are complaining about it. So you're saying the new the 2013 the fall 2013s do not have this problem
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.640]   I haven't seen it. They might well, but I have not seen it yet and I thought that they'd fixed it towards the latter end of the 2012 cycle
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.000]   Okay, so it's also important to note that as with any new apple product
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.280]   Don't even hesitate if you've got any sort of an issue with it take it right back to the apple store
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.240]   Not only because they have their usual where we're we're awesome policy about making you happy
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.280]   But also again, whether it's a phone a tablet a notebook, whatever
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   Cupertino issues a hunting license for the geniuses saying we're looking for we're looking please capture at least three devices that have been dropped
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.480]   Please capture one device that's been exposed to water. Please capture
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.040]   Right. There's a lot. I've seen these lists
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.560]   It's a long laundry list of specific issues in which they won't even hesitate
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.800]   They will put that into a big plastic coffin ship it back to Cupertino and swap you out a new one
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.040]   That's not an official policy mind you
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.400]   But within the first two or three weeks of a new product card that it should at least encourage you to
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.080]   Why don't you go? Don't just wait to see if this gets better
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.120]   Maybe you should take it back right today because that's very very possible
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.960]   That will do things that they're not required to do under warranty that are to your benefit
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.200]   um
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   So
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.720]   Marko, uh, r-man at marko.org has an article, uh, retina macbook pro iR test
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.320]   Image retention test that he says you can test this but he also says I don't think this can cause permanent damage
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.080]   But I can't be sure
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.560]   So don't hold me responsible for this
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.720]   So what you do is make the windows large as possible display the grid for 10 minutes
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.040]   Then switch to gray screens with this is a lot of work to get screen retention
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.040]   Screens with image retention will show a faint impression of the grid on the gray background
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.600]   Are people too picky or is this really a big problem? Is this really annoying?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.640]   I notice it, but it doesn't bother me, but it's it's completely noticeable and you can think that there's transparency where none exists
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.480]   Like an understand why it bothers people. Yeah
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.400]   Also, I mean these these are mac products we're talking about we're used to perfection
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.800]   There there's there's so many there's so many times when i'll get like a $500 windows notebook
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.120]   And I will note that there is a certain
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.440]   Problem that's a little bit annoying, but I'll say okay. It's a $500 tablet. Oh, it's a
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.200]   No, but can it's a sauce so you can it's
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.600]   You're not quite so sensitive
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.760]   But really when you buy an apple product just it not whether you should or not you simply expecting your hand that I should
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.720]   Everything should be absolutely perfect. I should be 100% satisfied because if you're not satisfied apple will try to make you happy
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.080]   Yeah, but and and the other side you know stuff happens. I mean exactly, you know
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.440]   First to make a million is always problematic. Yeah, in fact, we've even said that don't buy so now I see it
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   But I think it's it's actually retinal image retention not screen image retention
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.240]   So that's one of the problems stare everybody stare for a bit and I don't know if this happens to your tv
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   Now that's the center of the screen is out of focus for some reason what what the hell?
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:34.600]   Okay, everybody we're gonna stare at this for a while and then i'm gonna switch to gray and even if you're watching on tv
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.400]   You will because of your retina you will see it see I see it
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.920]   So
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.200]   Maybe I don't know maybe I can't is that no, maybe that's not my well
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.120]   You know what I am seeing it without my retina
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.000]   So I must but see I never even noticed it until I did this so this is a fall 2013
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.200]   And I do see the image retention a few seconds
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.080]   You know the because the all of these are burning a few seconds is not bad
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.000]   But mine will linger for minutes and that's where the problem with the 2012s were like you know 15 minutes later you would still see the image
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Don't use gray
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.320]   Everybody
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.240]   Stop doing gray. I'll see the retinas is a the retina
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.600]   MacBook is a pro level hardware for people using it for professional things. There are a lot of graphic designers
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.120]   Cover art for for scobbins. Yeah
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.400]   Right
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.960]   You think that no doubt you think that madness you think that all these other groups they don't need like reissues
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   That's you're gonna need your that checkerboard pattern. Yeah
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.800]   You're right. I'm trying to find the he said somebody said there's a there's a terminal command
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.320]   That will that will tell you what monitor you have
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.960]   Macintosh terminal command
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.360]   Samsung image retention
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.440]   That's the google search and the answer is
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.760]   Joe supplied Joe supplied a helpful
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.120]   Here it is. Are you ready?
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.760]   I can't even I can't even read you this and we were not going to put a graphic on the screen because it's so long
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.600]   I oh we're using the I O reg command
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.200]   I'm not even familiar with that, but let's just try it
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.240]   Let's just try it here. I O reg
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.000]   Agreeing to the xcode studio requires admin. Please rerun a pseudo. So you have to do pseudo
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.320]   I
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.800]   This isn't this like the same problem of like patients come into doctors
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.320]   They've they've diagnosed themselves on the internet with some like dengue fever
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:42.440]   And now we're people coming into the to the genius bar saying I've self diagnosed this as an lg display produced during early
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.000]   2013 which is known to have an issue here
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.240]   And now they have to say well, no, that's congratulations excellent use of terminal commands, but that is not an issue
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   Please go home. Stop bothering us. So now I have xcode on here, but I don't think I've ever run it. So let me just run
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.680]   xcode I agree to the license agreement. Okay, so you need xcode on your system to use I O reg
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.200]   Apparently
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:16.760]   We know too many things and understand too few things. That's our problem as users. Okay, here we go color lcd
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.720]   But I don't even know now how to read this
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   So we have data back to the googles. I have data. Here's the string lp
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   154 wt1 sga one
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:34.440]   Uh, which one is is that the hardware part that probably is right? Should I google that?
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:43.400]   Okay
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.720]   Uh
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.560]   LG that's an lg display
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   The lp 15
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.920]   Version of the red dot like on the iphones that warns the the the genius that this phone has been exposed to water
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.680]   And so it's probably not the phone's fault. There's gonna be another like software thing to say okay
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.080]   Well, the user has run pseudo commands without any understanding of how pseudo commands were
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.040]   Probably this is not a warranty issue. There's a little piece of paper that tells whether you
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.840]   Run pseudo
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.240]   Oh, I'm I'm sorry the you self-diagnosed beyond your technical means
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.080]   Paper is thou green which means that I'm gonna go in there
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.960]   I've run iowregg and I know I have an lg display in here
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.760]   In fact if you'll allow me to look at the replacement units
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.440]   I would like to go through them and run this command first. I'll have to install xcode in each of your machines
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.080]   First guy ever thrown out of an apple store
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.280]   Just makes just make sure whatever the complaint is you end it with the magic phrase
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.000]   And now I want to know what you're gonna do about it
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.920]   Yeah, because that always works. Let's
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.880]   So I don't I don't know where to put this information so that people at home can try it
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.320]   But I think you could do what I just did which is google
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.960]   terminal command
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:04.760]   This is on the ultimate apple web blog our retina macbook displays blah blah blah and that is uh, it's iowregg space dash
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.040]   Blah blah there's a grep in there. There's a set in there. It is a it's a good
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:18.280]   Nice healthy display of technical expertise that's steve sandy has some chops. That's your mac is okay. It will say
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.800]   zeroing out every sector on your hard drive if it's bad
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.120]   It will only say reformatting your hard drive
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.000]   But just wait for do you get the prompt back before you do anything?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So web 64 cents has leo you shouldn't make light of the issue
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.720]   Sometimes retention can last up to 20 minutes and people have paid exorbitant amounts of money for their mac books
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.520]   I agree. She and I'm making light of it. I agree. I have it. I have it too. I have lg
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.040]   Uh, so uh, the good news is you can take it to the apple store and they'll replace it with an unknown
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.720]   Display of you. Do we know they will or maybe they will
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.760]   Uh people have had good luck so far taking it back
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.120]   They will run a test on it
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.720]   My understanding is they will run a test on it to see if the retention is beyond whatever
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.480]   tolerances they allow
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.000]   Yeah, that's why I mean there's there's uh, you can always make
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.160]   put me raise the point of fact that apple hardware costs a lot more money than equivalent hardware on windows
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.640]   But that's one of the reasons why you get that markup because no other place you drive to the mall
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.320]   You don't even you don't even have to say here is the here's the pseudo commander ran
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.480]   I'm proven. I've proven that got the lg display
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.000]   You can simply say
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.720]   There's images seem to be burned in and that makes me unhappy and what they're what they're going to key in on is the fact that
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.840]   The customer is unhappy what we can do to put a smile on that face
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.520]   I guess oftentimes and I guess the other point which is a good very valid point, which is this happened last year
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.600]   And it's apparently still happening so on the new ones so
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   Uh, but that's an awful long time to spend on a topic that is of fairly limited use. So
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.320]   Let's move on if you don't mind
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.480]   Uh, do we yet know
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.600]   Mr, uh, mr. rumor monger rene richy when I can finally order my
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.000]   iPad mini with retina display
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.600]   We do not apple had their conference call last night and they stuck to later in november as the date
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.480]   Which probably means that that product is coming in so hot
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.840]   It is all they can do to get a few models into the stores before christmas
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.800]   That's because you think of uh shortages of retina
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.320]   7.9 inch retinas. Yeah, that was a hard product to make
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:23.560]   I mean just all around that was a hard product to make and uh tim cook set on the call yesterday that he believes it's uncertain or it's
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.680]   Unclear whether they're going to have sufficient quantities to satisfy demand over the holidays. So if you do want one shop early
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.800]   Yeah
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.600]   Yeah, well, that's the that's why we want to look for that date because I want to get online at midnight
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.040]   Midnight cupartino time cupartino time and order the damn thing
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   um
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.760]   Okay, let's talk about the earnings call because he did uh if you have your bingo card out
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.560]   He did say a new product category to come
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:54.120]   You mentioned that rene last week or maybe was andy somebody said listen for the that phrase
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.320]   Uh, so that sounds like a watch. Oh, I guess it could be a tv, but I think it's much more like
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.840]   It could be a strudel. We really I mean
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.640]   It's gooder middle here. Yeah, it could be a scooter could be anything
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   But I think likely very likely given everything you know and others know that it's a watch
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:14.440]   Or or at least a wearable fitness item. They've done a lot of hiring from people who are working in fitness products
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.600]   So whether it's a watch or not. We don't know but if it's if it's not something you put on your wrist then i'll be surprised
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.800]   He also said it's getting a look a lot like an ipad christmas
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.080]   He actually used the phrase ipad christmas. He did he was all in on that
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:37.480]   One thing I thought was curious is that a lot of people are really angry that I mean they expected apple to have a new product category
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.680]   By the end of this year and they're upset. It's not out already
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.640]   But the thing to me is that if you rush that thing out you get the galaxy gear and that is not an apple lot
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.920]   It's not some interesting things about it, but that is not an apple product
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.880]   And I would much rather apple does what they usually do which is you know wait and then do that big show and introduce their new thing
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.320]   When they've actually got it ready to ship within a reasonable amount of developer, you know testing time by the way
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   He said products and product categories
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.240]   Was plural, right?
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:14.680]   Yeah, I think we're gonna take we're gonna see exactly how important ios 7 was it wasn't just about enhancing the phones that are already there
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.800]   It was also putting in the infrastructure and putting in the developer support for stuff that has not been announced yet
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.920]   If you look at the skills apple has from heart. This is tim cook speaking from hardware
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:32.120]   Software and services and an incredible app ecosystem. These set of things are very very unique
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.720]   Of course unique. I don't know. Okay. I'm not gonna go on with that
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.640]   Andy knows what i'm talking about the west wing reference i'm making
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.760]   Now he doubles down on very unique. It's very very unique
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.400]   At the same time, no one likes someone who wants to point out that a tomato is not a vegetable. I know or
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.520]   Like thank you very very preppy move on
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.880]   We obviously believe that we can use our skills he says in building other great products
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.560]   That are in categories
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.640]   That represent areas where we do not participate today
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   That sounds like more than just a watch
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.880]   But that's what you say if you're a CEO of apple and you've spent the last 10 years making something like the a7 processor and
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.760]   You know building up all your your software hardware and services divisions because that's what lets you
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.080]   Do those kinds of products and I think he's gonna be as non-committal as possible until he's got a product he's really happy about
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   Yeah, I mean the galaxy gear is a great a great example
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:34.920]   I think it's kind of a signature product for sam song and this is a I think that the the they released two interesting items at the same time
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.880]   Samsung they the the note three and the galaxy gear and they're both I think signature
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.360]   Samsung products where
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.840]   Nobody had any interest or and expressed any desire for a phone that big and what do you know?
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.400]   It turns out that people love it and it's a big big seller great
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.560]   then there's the
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.400]   Galaxy gear which again nobody nobody indicated interest in having a wrist wristwatch like that and
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.080]   Well, you know, it turns out that nobody does have an interest in watch like that because the return rate on these things is astronomical
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.600]   But you know you roll the dice sometimes you get I don't know enough about dice games to know what the bad number is
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.120]   The one the one that lands your little brother on the sorry part of the game
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:21.000]   That's why I'm glad we have both apple and sam song because apple is incredibly conservative with new product rollout and samson will just throw anything away
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.920]   And as someone who loves technology, I want to see all those crazy products because the ones that work like the galaxy know it'll be really interesting
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.480]   So niela I've been told there's a great job
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   On the verge of of cron of the chronology of all of the pronouncements tim has made along
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.600]   These lines in in october 2011
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.480]   He mentions the steve jobs biography february 2012
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:50.520]   Cook says during the goldman sax conference apple doesn't do hobbies as a general rule and need something more main market
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.000]   september 2012
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.160]   television no
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.080]   December 2012
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.160]   on rock center with brian williams an area of an intense interest
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:08.200]   It and he's mentioned products and categories several times now. So this is pulling threads
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.120]   Yeah, it would be literal boy. Paul talking about pulling threads. Wow
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   Wow
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   We can just wait for them to do what they're going to do. Yeah, let's just see
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.680]   We'll just see it. It is likely apple would introduce something new at some point given their past history
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.040]   It's not it's not like the iPad mini is not an interesting product. It's not like the iPad air not an interesting product
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.160]   It's not a thought it
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.760]   We've got lots of things you can actually go and put our hands on and talk about this
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.200]   Um, we're gonna talk about iOS 7 and the we fee problem
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.720]   in just a bit
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.440]   But first a word from squarespace.com

[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.960]   And if you decide to sign up after your trial
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.800]   Use our offer code macbreak 10 and you'll get 10 off and show your support of course for macbreak weekly macbreak 10 the offer code
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.280]   Uh, I think everybody knows how much we love squarespace. We use it for our own inside twit blog
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.360]   squarespace
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   Dot com try it free and if you decide to buy mac break 10
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.520]   Larry lessegg
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.200]   Uh one of our favorite constitutional experts. He's uh, was at Stanford's now. He's back at harvard
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.280]   Um, and he brought his blog back a couple of weeks ago. He hadn't blogged in quite a while just in time
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.760]   to bitch about
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.360]   iOS 7
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.560]   He says I upgraded my iphone to ios 7
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.440]   Oh three it killed wifi a lot of people are complaining about this. I have not had that problem
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.240]   I went to the apple site to see what the community had to say seems there are lots of people the same problem
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.680]   I tried all the recommended fixes including reinstalling the system software restoring from a backup
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.600]   Uh, nothing worked wifi came back for an hour. It's gone again
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.320]   But here's the problem. Uh, he says apple is not responding to comments
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:11.240]   Which leads its users and again people were volunteering their time to help lower apple's customer support costs to express on these uh forums to express increasing
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.360]   Exaspiration at the unanswered
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.920]   problems
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.640]   So, um now this is where the constitutional lawyer leaps to the fray
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   Because he made a comment
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.680]   He tried to post a question to another post asking whether apple indeed scrubbed comments
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.600]   In other words, were they censoring the community which they have the right to do it is after all on an apple server
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.160]   at apple.com
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.400]   He posted, uh, you know, he was he was inquiring about the warranty
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.520]   and uh, and somebody
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   Made a claim and got a new one and said persevere and Larry wanted a comment
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.120]   Uh, then he noted the comment had been deleted. So he reposted it
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.240]   Imagine if we had the same warranty rights in america that europeans have in europe
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   But then to my utterly naive astonishment says larry lecic apple removed my comment
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.960]   Uh sending an email to me recently you posted a polar petition in the apple support communities
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.800]   We understand your desire to share experiences in your topic because these posts are not allowed in our forums
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.920]   We have removed it. They are intended for technical questions
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.200]   That can be answered by the community
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.320]   He goes on and says well, what exactly is the valid objection here? This is a community site
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:41.080]   People are no apples not responding people are frustrated. They talk about the warranties and recourse
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.680]   When did it become inappropriate to inform people about legally protected rights related to technical issues
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:53.960]   So hey apple he says if you want the free help given by members of your community treat them with respect
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.800]   Even something as simple as a thanks for the comments. We're looking into it would be a really cheap way to show that respect
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:05.480]   And a policy against scrubbing comments offering people completely legitimate advice
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.120]   For dealing with their technical problems would be one more although admittedly that's less cheap
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.600]   And then of course he invokes the memory of steve chops
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   Who would not only have a race to comment but sandblasting
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.320]   Yeah, I think larry probably is a little bit pie-eyed on that one, but
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.560]   uh
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   Actually, he says
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:34.360]   Remember when steve jobs was at the helm many of us were willing to cut the genius some slack that willingness is let's say
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.280]   waning
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.480]   Now larry has a bully pulpit and as yes, I mean, I just reread the entire blog post
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.520]   Uh is what he says legitimate is it a real problem? We've heard about this kind of scrubbing before
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.360]   I love larry lesteing but it's amazing to me when people think that they've discovered these things that have been going on for years for the first time
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.760]   Right, uh, it's exactly what you said apple is very careful with their discussion forums
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.880]   It let a lot of people talk but there are issues that they believe might
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.320]   Come back and bite them in the ass later and they're very careful to remove those right because the last thing that they need is someone
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   I saw on the apple discussion forums. Yes that you honored all these warranties and right and it's there to be a service
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.120]   It's not there to be something that gets them class action lawsuits eventually
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.400]   Yeah, also, I mean, this is a little bit like complaining
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.920]   You you there's a little bit like complaining that
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:27.640]   You're trying to unionize the thousand workers at your factory and the factory won't let you use the factory floor as a meeting hall
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.800]   For this action. I mean, which is and you can debate whether that the class you think what the class thing to do or the not class thing would be
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.960]   Do that's not a that's not an objective?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.480]   Uh, sort of determination, but the fact is this is apples forum. They can set their own rules
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:48.040]   Uh, and I think that if they want to limit discussion to something that they feel is focused towards one single goal
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.400]   Which is we we're not here to be a community of
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.640]   uh people who have been using the the mac for 10 years or using the iphone for three or four years as a as a meeting house for
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.600]   Whatever they want to talk about this is for the people who just broke the shrink wrap on their first iphone a week ago
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.120]   And don't know how to get this sort of sinking service working. They want to find
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.480]   They they they also want to find an open discussion so that people can simply can go ahead and say that gee
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.360]   I don't know why apple isn't addressing this but i've been having this problem for three or four weeks
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   It is still valuable to the consumer that they know that they're not the only people who've been having this problem
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.120]   And even people who've been using an iphone for two years have been having this problem
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.720]   So that's valuable too, but to all to insist on unlimited discussion on any topic
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:34.600]   That's just not realistic. I mean, it's good. It's good that someone with his uh with his voice and his rational point of view is
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.000]   Is raising this point again because I think that
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.520]   That is the as as you said, it's it's sort of like the other the other edge of the sword if apple is going to
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.280]   Host this forum to allow the community to essentially do a lot of like frontline tech support for for its own products
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   They have to accept that sometimes these people are going to say things that apple doesn't doesn't like
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.720]   But nonetheless like when they said I mean they have their they have the ability to limit discussion in any way that they want
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.840]   If they ever restrict it in such a way as to be absolutely horn swogingly
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.640]   Obnoxious that will bite them in the button ways that they none of us can possibly imagine
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.440]   For now everybody seems to be okay with the terms of service so to speak that have been established
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:21.240]   And the last point that I thought was compelling is that it takes these discussions also sometimes take away the actual problems people are having
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.360]   Wi-Fi issues have plagued apple customers and iOS devices
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.080]   Every time there's a new ipad every time there's a new version of iOS this Wi-Fi issue comes back
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.880]   Um, I don't know why they have so much trouble with Wi-Fi, but it's obvious that they do
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   And I would just encourage people to go to apple
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.240]   I mean if they can't solve it using any of the tips there or anything they find on google
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.960]   Go to an apple store and you know pull the steve jobs this device is supposed to have Wi-Fi
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.360]   Why does it not have it and just go down on the table?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.440]   Yeah, that's always the smartest thing don't don't try to diagnose your own problem
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   Either just jumping back to this and what we were saying earlier. Don't just say this
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.320]   I expected to do this it doesn't do that. What's the problem?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.720]   That's always the most successful avenue of gang tech support from apple. Yeah
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:10.120]   Um, you know, I'm a little sympathetic with larry, but it reminds me also of emails that I get almost every day from people who say
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.480]   I was in your chat room and I got kicked out for saying x
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.200]   and um
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.920]   I do understand that when you are maintaining a community and there's a certain way you want that community to be you have to be kind of ruthless
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:29.320]   In maintaining that community. It is not as if there are not other third party discussion forums where you can go
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.920]   Um, so I think it's not unreasonable for apple to say well, look
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   This is the official apple discussion forum. So we're going to be a little bit aggressive in making it be
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.760]   A certain way precisely for what you said apple or andy
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:49.320]   Because they don't want people to say well look it says right here on the official apple forums that apple does this
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.200]   Yeah, I think i think as rene who said that but rene
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.400]   I mean the the other I mean the the the uh
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:01.080]   The the other thing that should be at least mentioned is that again while we really should be vigilant against
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.920]   uh
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   Mistaking apple for a
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.080]   Non-profit
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.880]   Company that gives out free surf surfing lessons and teaches you how to make vernoul and how to use
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.560]   You how to produce a sustainable architecture. They are a large corporation
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.080]   They have an immense amount of power which they could they could abuse in horrific ways if they chose to do so
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:26.840]   The other thing that needs to be said though that is that every time we've had we've had legitimate concerns
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.640]   So they they give us at least one an opportunity a year to be legitimately concerned about what
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.080]   They're up to and I keep I keep rewinding back to when they
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:42.520]   Started the app store and started putting so many controls on what we will tolerate if you want to publish something publish software
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.760]   for the mac and publish software
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.840]   For for iOS devices and although there were a lot of hiccups to begin with it's true that google had
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:57.800]   Apparently had little difficulty in getting apps that enhance google services services that compete with with apple services
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.840]   Into the app store amazon has had no problems
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:08.520]   Getting updated versions of the kindle app and every time that it looked like apple might be doing something to sort of slap them down and make them
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.280]   Make the kindle solution not as attractive as the iBook solution
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.360]   It turns out it was simply an extension of a policy that was affecting all developers. So
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:24.280]   Although don't don't love blindly you should I whenever I have those concerns. I have to think that no this isn't facebook
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.600]   They haven't really screwed me over in any way shape or form
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.840]   Again eternal vigilance is the is the is the cost of liberty
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:37.320]   But still it has to be said that apple has had a really really good track record and be in not abusing our trust
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   All right, we'll move on
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.600]   Larry deserves, you know the attention because he's larry and I love him
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.360]   Because larry isn't a blowhard and he's not a he's not a bozo
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.760]   He knows what he's talking about and when he speaks he speaks very thoughtfully so even so
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.560]   Although this isn't something we we've never heard before
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.000]   It was valuable to hear it from his perspective and hear how he would choose to elucidate it
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.640]   So that was a very very I thought it was a very valuable blog post
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.560]   And it's anybody who thinks apple doesn't make mistakes
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.840]   Is really paying it's not an apple user for very damn long
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:16.680]   And I think though that you highlight you you said something that I think really highlights the real problem here
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.720]   Which is people have a different and gila milio observed this
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.240]   People have a very different relationship with apple than they do with any other company
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.680]   Uh, there's this sense that apple somehow is your friend. It is
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.240]   From and it goes back to the early days when apple really they were the rebels
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.600]   fighting against, you know the big brother
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.840]   1984 gray
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:44.280]   IBM types the crazy ones the crazy ones and uh, you know, I I was around then and I had that kind of feeling of loyalty too
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.560]   Um, but it would probably behoove us to remember that that's not actually true
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   It's just a company
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.000]   They they believe that they believe deeply in every principle that they speak of openly
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.360]   That's that's why I don't believe that the that the video that they used to to start off ww
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.480]   dc and their press event last week was schmaltzied anyway
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.160]   I do believe they believe in all those things
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.760]   But I also believe that they believe in making money and if there's a way that they can
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.160]   They don't believe they don't believe that in order to succeed other companies can have to fail
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.680]   But you know what's better than succeeding at the cost of your competitors
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:25.560]   There's I I'm sure that at some point some bottle of something is opened and drunk with a certain amount of pride
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.360]   That they can't share with anybody else. I'm sure that oh yeah
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:35.640]   They're a real they're a real profit making enterprise. I can't I can't tell you why there will be free donuts at all break stations
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:43.560]   For the next three days just enjoy the free donuts and and think of those donuts as you drive pasties microsoft service rt bus
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.240]   Hey, let's let's take a break. I do we kind of skimmed over
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:55.080]   You know some of the comments from Tim Cook in the the earnings call but we should talk about the actual results of the earnings call
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.480]   In just a second
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.560]   But first I want to tell you about a brand new app
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.880]   From our great friends. It's smile software. It's pdf pen
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.680]   scan plus
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.000]   It's a scanning an ocr app for your iPhone and your iPad
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.840]   You have such great cameras even in the iPad, especially the new iPads now that really
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.760]   You've got a scanner in your pocket. I've I've done this so many times
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.160]   I did it just the other day. I was uh somebody I needed to submit some pay stubs
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.360]   And I didn't have a scanner to hand. So I use the iPhone took a picture
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.440]   I use the iPhone because I had the best camera
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.960]   Took a picture
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.440]   And uh, it's fabulous one touch scanning directly from your iPhone or your iPad

[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.040]   You can use ocr to convert those scans into searchable pdfs
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.280]   The app does the ocr so it's not uploading to the server so your confidentiality is preserved plus you don't have to be connected
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.360]   Here's a here's an example
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.120]   Uh if you're watching the video the the ocr supports 16 languages
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.040]   It's a great companion

[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.960]   Just I think the ocr alone is fantastic
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.840]   I you know, I've always used the iphone to take pictures of documents to store like receipts and stuff
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.800]   But now having that ocr in there that is really sweet. Yeah
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:20.440]   Uh, I should I don't have my iphone here or I would show you it's really awesome get it $4.99. What a deal such a deal
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.160]   Thank you smile smile software
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.040]   PDF pen scan plus
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.120]   In this a plus sign. I think if you i bet if you search for scan plus
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.160]   You know, let me try this. There's this
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.720]   kind of little-known trick
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   App store.com/
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   Um, let me just see you can often do app store.com
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.480]   And the name of an app, but the search is so
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.200]   It's a little funky
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.280]   So that did not work. Let me try
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:59.080]   Because what it does is it app store.com links to the uh apple search. I presume that's an apple feature
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.040]   Could be a third party doing it
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.600]   Let me do smile
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.360]   Smile software that might find all the smile stuff
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:15.000]   Apple's got to work on the search in the app store. Yes
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.520]   Somewhat in
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   Incomprehend symbol. It's not their forte
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.400]   Not not this is this is one of those complaints about apple screwing up that we mentioned we referenced earlier
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.040]   It goes it goes on
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.080]   continues
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.600]   Really good heart search
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.640]   Needs a little it's like it's like sometimes when you find a problem or find a fault
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:41.240]   You should be happy because that demonstrates that faults are being looked for and that your hardware for finding them
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.320]   Is in fact working perfectly and so the things that you trust that have been validated
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:50.440]   Now apple had its q4 fourth quarter conference call
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.280]   um
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.840]   And you know depending who you read
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.080]   It was either a great quarter or not such a great quarter
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.880]   I think there's a lot of room for interpretation. This quarter only includes a little bit little
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.120]   part of
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   the iphone five s sales
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.240]   um yet that was enough to kind of
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.640]   turn the uh
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.880]   turn the um graph to a you
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.920]   on uh sales
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   So modest uh tech crunch said modest re acceleration
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.520]   After three quarters, uh in a row of slumping growth after three quarters of no profits the
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.720]   Sorry, but new pro of no products the first new product returns them. Yeah
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.440]   This is we've seen this before have we not?
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.520]   Every time it's a you know you app if you look at a graph of apple earnings is you you you you
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.920]   And ipad was flat and mac was flat but everyone was waiting for the new ipad
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   Everyone was waiting for the haswell macs. It's not right
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.400]   Yeah, now those who look at apple's profit margins
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.160]   Might legitimate be leave be a little bit concerned, right?
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:03.000]   Apple Tim clocked at a really good job of explaining that in that apple's profit margins are being pushed on both ends right now because they're making products
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.120]   Like the ipad air and the retina ipad which increased their cost was are much more expensive products to make
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.240]   But at the same time they are reducing prices or holding prices or more expensive products
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.920]   So it costs them more to make and they're not selling them at the same amount of profit
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.960]   They used to which puts pressure on their margins and that really does bother some people in wall street
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:28.200]   They're also doing this subscription accounting for more of their stuff now. I think 900 million dollars more
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.880]   That lets them defer
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.320]   I think they said it was two years for an iphone and four years for a mac
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.640]   But it means they can account for this free mavericks and free i-works
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:43.240]   And all of that because margin is being deferred along with everything else. I think they said a dollar to dollar rate
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.360]   It creates a perception which some people equate with reality, you know, that's absolutely they're
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.440]   They're right to do so, but it does make the analysis. I think more nuanced than a lot of websites are reporting
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:02.120]   It's uh off uh apple stock price it apple stock price is off about 14 bucks since the announcement
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.960]   But it's still at 521. I mean it's it's still well over 500
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.920]   Uh, and let's not let's head hasten to say it's not that apple didn't make money
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.720]   They made a lot of money seven and a half billion dollars
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.920]   Yeah, so it's not like it's just that they didn't make as you know, the profit margin wasn't as high as it has been
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.800]   in the past 37 and a half billion in revenue
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:30.200]   7 and a half billion net profit that's eight dollars 26 cents per share and it is a
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.080]   uh decline of net profit of
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.720]   8.6 from this time last year
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.200]   So that's the thing that concerns people I guess
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.360]   But you just you just explained it. I think fairly well the margin is shrinking
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   dividends are the same right
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.480]   4.7 decline earnings per share
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.840]   Yeah
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.680]   The big difficulty every time there's one of these earnings calls that you have two different teams of analysts who are looking at these numbers
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.480]   You have one team that has the broader perspective of apple as a technology company
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:06.760]   Who does not necessarily have the expertise and looking at really grinding down these business numbers?
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.240]   Uh, and so they might be picking a part as well. Look at that look how few uh,
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.880]   I think this this chart is where this number is proving that uh, that uh, apples
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:22.680]   Apple's share of desktops is now sort of grinding down and though that line demonstrates this that the other or they're apple fans who are going to
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.120]   Look at another number and saying yes, but look at this graph and how well that does without
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.760]   The ability to look at the entire base of numbers and evaluate apple as though or any other company
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.880]   Who are not seeing these results and the other group of people are the people who are just like again the the
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:43.320]   Sheldon Cooper's who are just financial analysts who are looking at numbers who who will who do have a complete understanding of that and who will say that oh
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.880]   What's troubling that that uh, that they're not making as much money on each product as they were before it's troubling that they have not
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.080]   announced they have not announced a new product space and in this amount of time
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.800]   and they're wrong because they're not they're
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:04.920]   They could benefit from looking at the forest and saying that apple has apple is in the business of making insanely popular products that people love and people keep buying
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:12.360]   Even if their last item was the exact same product before and it doesn't necessarily matter so much that they're this number
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.720]   You're right this graph does not look as flat as it should be or as pointy as it should be or as curvy in the right places
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.840]   It should be so long as they are setting themselves up for the right thing to the right product line in two or three years about
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.000]   So that's why I do have the benefit of not being a business reporter
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.720]   but nonetheless
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   I always have to sort of
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.440]   Take three steps back from any conclusion. I'm likely to draw from anything that I see in these reports
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.080]   There's some things that I kind of look at say gee isn't that kind of interesting or should I shouldn't I follow up on that?
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.800]   But there's always those three tablespoons full of
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.880]   Remember thou out mortal remember thou out mortal remember that you
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:55.960]   You you passed your math classes, but you never took a post grad course that you had that that didn't totally be funnel you
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.520]   So don't think that you know anything about this. I think there are a lot of commentators that should really
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.080]   Be measured in the conclusion. They're gonna draw from these numbers 37 profit margin ain't bad. I'd take it
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:13.960]   Yeah, and these are the numbers that we mortals non-investors should probably pay attention to which is sales figures
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:19.320]   Uh and mostly about the trend and iPod sales down 35% not a surprise
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.040]   They did not announce I don't know if we really mentioned this but they did not announce a new iPod this year
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.080]   And they gave you a space gray just like two years ago. They gave you white
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.960]   Yeah, so I mean I don't think iPod is an important category anymore. It's an interesting buried
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.240]   It's at the bottom of the press release. It's not even in the the meat anymore, right
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.000]   Um max
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.520]   Go ahead apple is and remember that apple is famous for cutting loose any product line. That's not really sending the world on fire
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.600]   So I think this is that's that product lines is just shrinkdough soon. Yeah
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.320]   I mean who I mean you can buy you get an iPhone
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.600]   I I think the losing the iPod touch would be a deal
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:58.120]   A not a good thing because there are a lot of sales are so far down. I guess nobody's buying it, but I thought for kids
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.840]   I don't know I've had minis or I've had my baby. I'm gonna make a mini. I guess you're right. Yeah
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:08.440]   Max sales. This might be more. Uh, it feels that role. This might be a more concerned if you're a truck driver
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.920]   Max sales down 7%
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.160]   No new products until ww dc and that was only the air
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.680]   So we'll see what the max sales are like when the new macbook pros and then ui max and then u mac pro hit the market
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Okay, ipad sales flat and that's because there's new new ipads obviously this is year over year
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.120]   Um iTunes and software revenues up 22%
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.920]   That looks good on the bottom of course
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.760]   Did you tweeted out that apple made more money off accessories and motor oil made off hardware last time
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.440]   5%
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.760]   Increase in accessory sales apple finally recognized that it's you know, it's accessory
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.880]   Why should everybody else be making money making that cases?
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.600]   That's such a profit high profit margin
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.520]   um
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:56.920]   iPhone 5s sales 5c sales too for that matter had only been on for a couple of weeks in this quarter
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.680]   And yet accounted for 50 for 2% of apples overall sales
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.480]   So that's why you know, you'll wait for a new product to really look at this
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.040]   In fact, we I think we said last week or the week before that
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.520]   It's going to be the next quarter q1 that will be the quarter to watch as always
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.960]   Leo ipad christmas. Yeah, it's going to be and that's what tim's
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.240]   Response to all this was what just stay tuned. It's going to be an ipad christmas. Is it though?
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   I mean aren't uh tablet sales way up from other companies
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:32.680]   Evans had an awesome post on this where he he actually went and tried to find out where all these tablet sales were originating from
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   And he said you mostly have the ipad
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:39.320]   That people are buying to use as a tablet then you have a plethora of $50 to $100
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:45.240]   Android tablets mostly sold in china or asia that people are using to watch primarily video
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.760]   I mean, that's why you don't get web usage or other usage statistics off of them
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.720]   So those are such different markets that at least he contends that they should be measured separately
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   And that's why you see apple's market share not reflective of their usage share
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:03.640]   Sand what was uh, I saw the number and i'm trying to remember what it was. I think
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.840]   160 million
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   tablets sold in that in this quarter
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:14.760]   Something like that it was a large number a useless amount. Yeah, so somebody's buying tablets
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.920]   I imagine that the the kindle fire is a big one, right?
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.520]   Nexus perhaps kindle fire is us mostly other tab
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:29.880]   Us do not sell well. Yeah, because the kindle is very few markets google is not historically good at pushing their own hardware
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.240]   I mean, it's popular, but they just don't have retail. They don't have a lot of other things
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:38.520]   So it's mostly ipads and these really really cheap blank black slab and white tablets
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.640]   That's why i've always i've always thought that
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:47.240]   Apple usually kicks off every media event with that number of hey, we have 80 percent of all usage out there
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Of of tablets worldwide. I'm I really do think they should break that number apart
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.720]   And look at how people are using those tablets
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:03.000]   I I think that's i've gotten to a one of those one of those days on twitter where and I had to say
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.080]   Okay, i'm going to turn off twitter for the rest of the day now because i'm
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.520]   Because every time every time you try it seems as though
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.200]   It's very difficult to defend the statement that there are other
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   Many tablets out there that are serving purposes that are different from the purposes that the ipad mini serves
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:25.560]   And people will not come back with well, here's how well the ipad mini
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:31.480]   Performs in the user's hands versus a kindle fire tablet versus a google nexus tablet
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.920]   They always say well here is the internet here's the international sales numbers and then
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:40.600]   Not replying but thinking yeah, but how about you break it down by actual countries in which both can both
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.640]   Devices are readily available. It's just such a complicated
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.560]   Metric that it's hard to predict a winner or simply say that this is the best tablet out there because
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:53.400]   Especially when you look at these seven inch these mini tablet forms
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:59.880]   These guys these these makers of these tablets are not making them for the same markets
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.280]   They know exactly who's money they want to get and they're going after those wallets. So
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:12.760]   Tim cook said ipads are doing well in one category better than anybody else education
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.960]   90 they said
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:22.040]   Tim said ipads make up 94 percent of the market for tablets in education 94
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:28.920]   Percent those are those boxes of 20 ipad 2s. That's where those are going. Yeah, that's there's the ipad 2 market
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.480]   um
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.560]   Especially if you feel at schools are price sensitive and you're afraid they might look at an x is seven
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.680]   Something like that, which is only 229 bucks. Hey 299 bucks
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.560]   We're so don't also
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.040]   That's 299 for the mini
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:52.680]   But but really it's it's so it's so hard to make that that case when you're trying even if even if I were even if you're trying to
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.320]   Sorry rewind playback
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.200]   It's it's it's it's so it's so hard to make that case of any other tablet but iOS for education
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.680]   I mean
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.480]   This is one area in which you if you don't have the apps and you don't have the ability to build a custom
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.240]   App for the purpose that for the educational track that you're supporting it for
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.680]   There's just no point in going for an x's tablet. There's almost no point
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.000]   There's certainly no point in going for a kindle tablet
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.400]   Which is designed to be bought in groups of one at a time for individual consumers
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:25.080]   Right now the only company that's doing anything that's an attractive option for school systems is is apple
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   And their management stuff is pretty good for it
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:35.000]   It's not great, but it's pretty good for schools and and enterprise that level two and you can provision vast amounts of devices and put vast amounts of apps on them fairly easily
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.640]   Yeah, you can buy carts that let you administer 20 of them at a time like a like a
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.280]   Massive toaster toaster factory
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.800]   There's again. This just no it's so hard to make that that use case
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:51.880]   So the only other option when I would talk to educators about buying moving into tablets and moving into multi-touch devices
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.360]   The only option that they that is even remotely attractive to them is windows
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.840]   And that's not because I think it's necessarily better
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:04.040]   But because it's very very easy in every single school system and every single department to find people who are trained up
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.480]   in administrating windows windows clients and also this
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.840]   It's there. There's a lot of experience in how to prevent
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:15.560]   100 arbitrary users that you're giving these tablets to into getting into mischief
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:21.240]   But even that that's not a perfect perfect device everybody if they're buying tablets. They're buying iPads. Yeah
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.920]   I bookery asked in the chat room a great question
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:30.840]   Is there a height it wouldn't be great if there were a hypercard like program for the iPad that teachers could use to create their own course wearing stuff
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.760]   is there such a
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.160]   Such a thing. I don't want to say itunes author. I'm really trying hard not to say it
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.240]   Books
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:44.680]   Filemaker is the closest thing they've got to that and I do know some teachers that are using it for that purposes, but it's
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.280]   Good a cyber card hypercard. I agree with that
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.000]   I mean, it's like wouldn't that would be the most interesting as you could possibly get because
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.520]   It's just to be not only for what it could actually do
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.120]   But because the way it presented itself to the user it didn't say here is a programming language
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.480]   Right, well developed backed by a scripting for thing for a presentation
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.920]   It is there is a stack of cards if all you want to do is create and type a stack of recipes
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.080]   That have no relationship to each other people let you do that
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.520]   If at one point you decide that you would like to easily navigate
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.360]   We will make it very easy if you don't navigate and then you learn to put scripts behind those buttons and then
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.600]   Then you've just like alien pods have taken over your brain
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.320]   You have been turned into a programmer would be without your will knowledge or intent
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:35.160]   Uh, so the closest I think the closest thing that we have to that right now is probably keynote believe it or not
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.320]   Because there's so much interactivity that you can
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.880]   Explore you can figure out in that if you want to apply yourself, but not as easy though
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:48.360]   There's even my dad did a hypercard stack the void darwin's voyages of the of the beagle
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.960]   and uh
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.920]   You know, he's a professor and and it was great educate. It was great way to do curricula
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.400]   Without being a programmer
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:03.560]   I think this would be a great effort app some skunk works at apple somewhere in kubertino get just five
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.280]   Maybe four maybe three maybe one great programmer and just start working on that
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.720]   It'd be such a good thing to add to an education
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.240]   Platform do you think maybe they've just sort of internally
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:24.200]   Unofficially defined hypercards type stuff as a pro app sort of thing where they're not well, but but but i'm saying that in terms of
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:31.320]   Creating populist software they put putting uh creative people creative people who are non programmers and giving them the ability to create
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.200]   Software-like things. I do think that they're they say that we've got two products before that
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   We've got xcode for people who uh who want to enter with intent
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:45.560]   And then there are apps like uh like ibupx author and apps like keynote
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.160]   That if you don't want to if you don't want to have that burden of learning
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.200]   We will give you tools that let you sort of fake the sort of thing you want to do
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.840]   Maybe hypercard is sort of in that middle because truth be told unless they were to
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:02.360]   Really, but let's apple really believed in this product where it's not just something
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.320]   They're going to put out there to maybe fill in a blank in their in their product line
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.480]   But someone there believes
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:12.040]   Passionately that this is going to be a defining moment for the ipad and for the future of apple
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.560]   They could easily create something that will let you do things that are not quite as slick as what you could do in keynote
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.240]   If you spent the that same amount of time and effort and and learning into developing it
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.160]   And would never ever ever let you do something as flexible as what you can do with xcode
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:29.960]   And right now they are saying that they're they're at least making the statement that it is not that difficult to learn how to
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.200]   How to build apps in xcode?
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.160]   It's not hypercard easy though
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:41.800]   It's not nowhere near that but maybe they believe that it's it's like uh, there's i've always i've always thought that there's i've
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.960]   I've got room in my life for two different kinds of burgers
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:49.880]   I for the cheap drive-through greasy sack of burgers and fries that cost you five bucks
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.960]   But delivers the delivers you carbohydrate sugar and protein
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.200]   And salt in quantities that you're programmed to like and chossy next to nothing
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.160]   I can i've got i've got a purpose for that or going to that burger place that caught the charges
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.520]   You may be 12 13 14 sometimes even 20 dollars for a burger
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:13.160]   But it's grass fed beef and they've got these three different kinds of cheeses on it and they source their own big energy
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:19.560]   Delicious thing ever right i don't i don't have any use whatsoever for a five guys five guys burger
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:25.240]   For me, it's like, okay, it's not good enough to be a great burger. It's not cheap enough to be a casual burger
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.920]   I have no use for you in my life. It's possible that at least from apple's point of view
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:33.400]   Hypercard is the five guys burger no point to it. No use for it. Why bother with it
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:40.440]   I think if I were I the problem is that young folks today do not
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.880]   Um, remember hypercard i never probably encountered it, but if I were a 22 year old
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.560]   computer science graduate adept in javascript
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.560]   And uh html 5 technologies I would right now
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.000]   Run out and make a hypercard for html 5
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.360]   Because it's because that'd be totally cross platform and uh and uh
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.320]   boy
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:11.400]   I think the opportunity is limitless put army make it happen. I saw you know one one smart
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   You know comps I graduate could do it. It'd be a great startup easy pitch to venture capitalists who remember hypercard
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:22.440]   Mm, but app but would apple allow it into the into the app store. It would would
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:29.320]   No, that's why you do it as html 5. It's not an app you do it as html 5 you do it. It's so so so build it on the web deploy it on the web and
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:34.040]   Use yeah, yeah, because there's so far he actually allows so much
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:39.160]   Untapped potential for creating user interfaces that you can actually do that quite well. Yep
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.240]   This is uh people who do remember missed
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.840]   But probably have forgotten that that's written in hypercard
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:53.480]   This was the predecessor science predecessor to mr. It was called the manhole remember this
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   Uh very missed like this also was done in hypercard now the thing you could do in hypercard is you could create
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:06.120]   Binary blobs with a programming language that you would add to it. I forgot the name of they were called
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.640]   No, no, no, no, no, no
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:15.160]   No, no, no, you could actually do it in in c or c plus plus and add it as a
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:20.840]   X I can't remember what it was called but an extension is in effect a binary extension
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.200]   I'm sure that that's right the miller brothers did with this lady had plugins. Yeah, um, but yeah, I mean
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.760]   Danny Goodman X. How hypercard by goal. Yeah, Danny Goodman remember that class
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:35.000]   So somewhere there's there are a few programming books that I will never throw away
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.280]   One is my beneath apple doss beneath apple protos and the other one is danny goodman's book on hypercard
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:45.480]   Because I have such an emotional attachment to this book that I carried everywhere and marked up
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.880]   Everywhere and they've got food stains of every like job the the cafeteria every job that I had when hypercard was out
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.720]   I'm telling you some there's some kid out there
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.440]   You're watching right now
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:04.680]   Do a little research find out what hypercard was written by the immortal bill Atkinson one of the greatest programmers who ever lived
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.400]   all by his self
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:12.760]   and and think about that kind of functionality what today's world would need an easy to use
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:18.520]   Kind of way to build it's not I don't want to say apps because it's not an app because it's really stack based
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.280]   But if you could make that an HTML5, I'm telling you
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.080]   billions
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:31.720]   Well, actually goop hasn't didn't google released something a couple of weeks ago that was an app for creating html
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.760]   That was actually really so much stuff. You can't keep track of it
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:43.720]   Today this morning they basically said give us all your pictures from now on forever and you
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.400]   Give us give a scary thing though is that like
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.360]   We imagine that the the kids today require something as
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.640]   Clear and as uncluttered as hypercard in order to get into programming and goodness
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.280]   the the the the years the the ages of
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.600]   People that can act who actually learn objective c and actually learn how to do something productive in xcode
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.400]   It's like the the age drops by 10 months every single year
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:18.040]   Uh, and I am meeting people who are nine 10 years old who are showing me a credible ios app
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.560]   That's not it's not just I know it's not a hello world app. It's not a flat
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.280]   I have it actually does something finish like oh
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:30.040]   I award this year and I forget how old ryan is but he must be in high school. Who's this the app finish
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.480]   Uh, it helps you do project planning for school like for homework and
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.520]   And things like that and I won the apple design award this year and I'm sure ryan must be you know in his
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:44.200]   It feels like he must be 12. I know he's not 12. That's what feels like by basil limited this one. Yes
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.840]   2013 apple design winner
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.680]   I wonder if he did it in straight up xcode c
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.000]   Objective c or if he had used a you know one of those right or use the job or something else. Yeah
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.440]   That is pretty
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.800]   It was pretty awesome. Yeah, that is pretty maybe maybe what we're advocating is that you know
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:11.320]   I think the teens today they should actually make bicycles with training wheels so they could learn and meanwhile
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   They're zipping by all like these super bikes
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.680]   Like see a grandpa
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.320]   I could write one of those
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:26.920]   So we got x we got xcode grams. We're fine. Exactly. They are 16 years old
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.320]   Yes, uh michael hanson and uh ryan or buck
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.120]   16 years old
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.080]   And that's the first time they ever wore a tie right there
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.920]   They look very they they didn't get the memo that you're allowed to wear t-shirts. It's fine
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.560]   Oh, they're on fock. They're on fock. They had a word
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.160]   I think that I think I don't want to presume but I I can totally see like them saying mom
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.520]   You're gonna look like dorks. You are going to be on television mr
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.800]   You're wearing a your grandpa your grandma are gonna be staying up to watch you. You're gonna be watching wearing a tie
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.520]   Hey, it's your dad's playing doing the interview. Here is a very dapper fella
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.760]   Yes, so I would wear a tie if I knew clinton morris was interviewing me. I'd wear a tie
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.080]   He he wears those british collars is mean he's very dapper
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.640]   There you go very attractive man
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.560]   Uh
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.120]   Look at him. Yes. He's like a male model
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.400]   You can't hear directly ottom is like the sun
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.120]   Yeah, I have to like just look away glance quickly at him
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.480]   Uh, we love you clinton. We just like to tease you
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.400]   Uh, let's take a break come back lots more to talk about we also have our picks of the week
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:45.560]   Um, I'll tell you let's start our picks of the week you guys by you picking each of you a story that we haven't because there's still quite a
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.480]   Few stories in the rundown that maybe you would like to talk about
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:58.200]   I can tell I will talk about the fact that my ios 7.0.3 5 s iPhone reboots a lot
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.240]   Is it reboot or respring leo?
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.680]   Uh, it reboots and I can tell you why it's it does respring as well respring is restarting springboard
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.320]   Yeah, but it uh, the reason I know it does a reboot is because the first time after a restart
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.120]   You try to use the fingerprint reader. It says no no you have to enter your code
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.000]   And that happens to me several times a day all of a sudden
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.680]   So it's without I don't know why but it's rebooting when i'm not around
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.080]   Don't you dare go to apple discussions to talk about it
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:29.720]   You know, I can make it happen by plugging it in uh to my you know, uh to my uh
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.120]   My my macbook retina with itunes running when itunes is running and it's plugged in and I choose of course launches
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.080]   It reboots it reboots randomly and it not randomly continually reboots
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.640]   703 yes
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   7.1 hurry up. I should bring it in, huh?
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.640]   I should just say hey, it's rebooting
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.040]   Would I have to demonstrate it?
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:59.160]   If I brought it to the apple store or would they just I would try reinstalling first and then if it's just to a dfu
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.520]   Yeah, I don't even a dfu just to still clean install it
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:07.400]   Does why we can't have nice software leo? Oh, that's a lot of work
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:14.040]   You would think about it's responding because it has you could have had a dead phone, but then it went back to the respawn
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.520]   But I can't I can't back up and restore I have to do it rebuild by hand, right?
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.400]   You can try the easy way first just
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.880]   Reinstall it and then when you get frustrated again
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.880]   I spent so much time getting everything into folders so I only have two pages on my springboard
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.520]   I have to time to spring clean you can get it out of abs until you need them again
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.480]   I did that when I got the five s yeah
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.480]   Now you have two pages of folders again
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.640]   Should I just wait for 704 and then see?
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:50.200]   7.1 it shouldn't be too too much longer. It's in pretty good testing just around the corner
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.440]   Okay, there's this been that's been a pretty fast velocity for for dot updates on seven
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.880]   Yeah, I think given how big it was because a lot of problems
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:04.840]   Well, it wasn't you. I mean they had compared to other iOS builds. It really started in in November instead of back in June. So yeah
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.280]   It came in hot
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.000]   Let us uh, let us take a break
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.240]   And talk about let us talk about shutter stock dot com
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.040]   the world's most amazing
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.560]   Website for stock royalty free stock images. I like I like
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:29.640]   Just checking let me just see because you know the copy says 28 million high quality stock photos
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.840]   The copy is out of date almost invariably. Yes. Now it is 30.5 million
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:41.560]   Royalty free stock images. That's because they added almost 200,000 this week alone. They uh, there's always new stuff
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.960]   at shutter stock
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.760]   And what I love about shutter stock is their very powerful search engine which allows you to find
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.840]   not only
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   not only images
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.120]   but uh
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.360]   You can modify the noun like okay, so i'm going to search for airplane
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.440]   So then it'll give me some airplane images, but I could say um, I could say what? Um upside down
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.320]   airplane for instance
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.560]   Will that work because sometimes you you really don't want to yeah, these are all upside down airplanes
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:24.040]   Now if you want to play with shutter stock like this, it's fun and you don't have to even give them a credit card
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.040]   You could just make a free account
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.160]   Uh, that way not only can you search and have lots of fun doing it actually you could search him without the account
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.960]   But after a few searches it says make an account so go ahead and do that
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:41.480]   Because then you could put those images in light boxes, which is nice because that means you could save them for future reference for inspiration or even share them with the colleagues
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.240]   Um, when you decide you want to buy an image you can buy individual image packs or a monthly subscription
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.840]   That's the one we have the 25 images a day. That's great for any publication. That's the standard subscription
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.480]   You can download any image in any size you pay one price, which is really fabulous
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:01.320]   Um, the ipad app if you haven't played with it is beautiful
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.760]   I mean, it's like 500 pixels or something. It's just it's beautiful image after image because these images are taken by some of the best photographers artists
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.480]   There's also click the footage tab. I think people sometimes forget to do this right at the top
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.520]   It says photos, but next to it says footage and there's a lot of
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:21.720]   Video as well 1.3 million royalty free stock videos in super high quality
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:28.200]   Um, they have a featured clip every week just as they have a featured photo that you can download for free
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.720]   This is our featured clip today little girl running across the wheat field at sunset
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.440]   With a shot with a high speed camera
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.040]   So I can I can say speed it up. I can say slow it down
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:55.240]   Let's go at normal speed. This is really gorgeous stuff

[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.640]   Global cameras genetically modified weeds are feeding more children worldwide
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.600]   More likely more likely, right? Um or fleet
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:31.960]   You did an article on i'm or was it you or somebody else and i'm more who about the iWork apps a big step back in work
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.280]   Automation, you know why
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.040]   This is annoying peter kon pin pointed. I think a very big problem
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.400]   Uh, they took out apple script
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   They they sort of didn't add it. So what happened is they the the code for iWork is really old
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.880]   It's like as far as I know it's open step old roger rosner used to be part of lighthouse
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.920]   I think it was back in the next step days and he's been making the software forever
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.240]   And the cold bay the code base was really old
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:04.920]   So instead of rewriting it they took the ios engine and they moved that over to the mac and it's sort of like a final cup pro 10
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.840]   Or iMovie. I think it was oh seven where they've stripped everything down
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.360]   They started rebuilding it, but they have not had time to add everything back
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:17.080]   I don't know if they'll ever add apple script back. It'll depend on what their business, you know purposes like
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.480]   Sausage going about spinning in his beret. I mean, that's just not nice
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.120]   Well, he did he did have some wins with mavericks
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.920]   So this is his mac OS automation page lists new features that mavericks included
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.440]   But yeah, every single every single loss is keenly felt and and and and avidly
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.200]   Punished
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.160]   There's there are people who are like, can I can I switch offices with you for at least five weeks as I don't want to
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.440]   I don't want to talk to south the next five weeks as I remove apple script from my product
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.400]   Uh, yeah, as peter con pointed out, microsoft word has better apple scrazzer a bigger apple script dictionary
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.040]   Yeah, then uh, I work now. There's two items in the dictionary. I mean it's nothing
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.320]   It's a huge compromise you get interoperability you get binary compatibility between ios and os 10
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.040]   And you get the features that being mirrored on the web
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.000]   So in terms of integration as a huge win in terms of specific features that might cause you so much pain
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.960]   You can no longer use them including the loss of automation then, you know, it's going to be a huge problem for you
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:18.280]   Yeah, that was that was kind of one of the larger gambles from last week's announcements that apple is doubling down on
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   On integration across apple products. There is no office suite that works so well across so many platforms
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.440]   I know I I work on everything is pretty much the same experience everywhere
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.640]   Which is going to be a good thing for independent and you know soul people who are doing things on their own
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.640]   however, they have
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.880]   Almost completely said that this product is in no way going to do the same work that microsoft office can do
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.920]   uh, because now where s pages
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.920]   Could be used for pages and numbers. I think they could be used for business
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.960]   But different kinds of business purposes and the interoperability between that app and office was very very good
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.400]   But chiefly they're talking they're talking about the same goal but with different intent
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.640]   Now they really are saying that we are going to be completely upfront about this
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   This is not intended for professional use
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.720]   I'm sure that some of you will be able to use it that way
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.000]   But this is not in any way designed to be a competitor to microsoft office
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.200]   That's an interesting move. I don't think it's necessarily the wrong move
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:20.360]   But it does mean that if apple intends to make any hay out of the idea, you know, our competitors actually charged 200 dollars for these features
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.040]   I think that everybody should say yeah, no, they're charging
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.120]   They're giving those things away in the form of wordpad a product that's so simple
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.880]   They don't even bother advertising anymore
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:36.120]   They're charging 200 dollars for the standard set of apps that if they're everybody's looking for in a professional resume these days
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.160]   So don't please don't say that habit tables 200 dollars for pivot tables
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.400]   But it's how you know, it sounds a good friend and I talked to him all the time and as he's pointed out
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   The one of the things that really propelled apple forward in
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.360]   Professional environments was the ability to automate workflows with apple script and automator
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.320]   Uh, and you see a lot of pre-press
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:01.080]   Uh, you know giant of course admittedly they're not using pages for pre-press, but this is a really
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.880]   They can't they can't
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.200]   Unless exports all you need you can't
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.120]   but uh, it's like pro-tendly
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.320]   I mean everyone was incensed when that came out and slowly bit by bit
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.240]   They've been returning functionality to it now if people are willing to give them a second chance
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.560]   It's not that bad and it is true. They desperately needed to start this project over so
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.120]   But but this is but this is a different thing apple script has always been the
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.760]   the the the mutant
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:35.880]   mutant identical twin to the goods fresh phrase scrub faced kid that they keep downstairs apple script has been like the one they
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   Keep chained up in the attic. They're not willing they're willing to still feed it and keep it alive
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.840]   But they don't want they don't really care about nurturing it and developing it which is a shame because
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   It's much more important than it would seem. I mean, it's it's yeah, exactly
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.200]   This is this is this is like having a back. This is like having emergency
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.800]   Generators somewhere in your house. This is like having emergency water in your house
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.800]   This is not something you use all the time, but when you have it it really proves it's worth
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.720]   And it's also
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.600]   There you're sort of running out of ways to really impress people with what a mac can do these days
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.000]   And really the I always take that first thing out of my pocket here. Let me show you automator
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.400]   Let me show you how between if you're if you're kind of on the fence between windows and a mac
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.760]   Let me show you how easy it is to add a feature to the mac right now
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.640]   And that's only possible through scripting a lot of people are not going to be using scripting
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:30.040]   But the automator is easy enough to use that they are going to probably touch it at some point when they run against the wall somewhere
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.760]   So my only my my large fear going forward with the mac is that
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.240]   Apple really doesn't care about providing an answer to that question
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.280]   What happens three months from now when they are no longer
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   Easy to use users and they hit a wall. How are you helping those users to get through that wall?
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.400]   They are I think at this point trying to say
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.280]   That wall is there for a purpose enjoy living inside this compound and try not to
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.200]   Try not to focus on the fact that there is light and daylight on the other side of that that
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.080]   Sal said go ahead and can she shoot you how to hot air balloon in right and we should point out
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.800]   Uh, these are free apps now
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.720]   Yeah, they're hardware subsidized apps now. Yeah, well and that by the way, that's one of the reasons apples
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.960]   Profit was down is because they had they took 900 million in deferred income
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.280]   Uh, now this is a complicated finance thing, which i'm gonna screw up
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.040]   Uh, because i don't understand how finance works, but essentially that this is giving away the os for free and giving away those apps for free
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:36.120]   Uh is lost income which they're going to instead of booking in one year, which would be 900 million dollars
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.160]   They're going to defer it over a number of years two years for ios and four years for mac and tosh
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.000]   and
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.720]   Their cfo says they're apple's going to work hard
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.320]   To improve profit margins in the hardware
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.440]   To make up for the loss in software in other words
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.720]   Uh, while you might say well apple makes so much money on hardware no big deal to give away these software
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.920]   It's not the case the fact that hit their uh, it hit their uh earnings
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:07.640]   Significantly and he said they're gonna do it in perpetuity too. It's not just a one-time by the way. Yeah, you know, I almost buried the lead
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.240]   That's actually big op and himer said we are gonna give away os 10 forever
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.160]   Yeah, that's the that we will never again charge for the operating system
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.680]   That's great. Yeah, that's a big story. I I
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.040]   We buried the lead that's impressive
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.000]   We stated as a prize for later in the surprise
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.360]   Guess what you'll never pay for operating but what cook said is we really think that the software is an important part of the mac and tosh
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.960]   And uh and ios experience and that's why we we want to give it away
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:40.680]   That's what we've always done. You want to make great software. You got to make the hardware too. It goes together
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.120]   I think it's more strategic than that. It really is about
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:50.760]   Convincing developers to get on board with this entirely new future for apple and the way to do that is to point them at here's how many
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.800]   People are running are running the latest version of the operating system
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.360]   We will always make it the most the simplest thing the most pain-free way to
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.360]   For people to upgrade
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.800]   And so therefore if the uses are are going to be eager to use 10.9
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.120]   Why shouldn't your app also be taking advantage of 10.9? So that's that's the real the real point of it
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:13.720]   So, um, I I said I was gonna let you guys pick some stories did
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.760]   Have I anything that there's a couple more I would we should mention probably the fact that disney and pix are yanked
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.600]   Uh
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:30.360]   Movies from the i2 store as well as the amazon prime store and if you had them in your libraries paid for they yanked those
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.800]   Tude some say that was a mistake a bug
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.560]   I'm kind of of the opinion. They just were curious what the reaction would be
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.560]   Twitter anybody knows it was a trial balloon is what i want
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:50.280]   Back, yeah, but that's probably all you know, we've been asking for the fusion of like the cable companies and the and these service providers
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:58.760]   All along. Unfortunately, they said they what they really adopted from that business model is let's try to remove services and keep the price the same and see who notices
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.320]   Uh, we'll see it's not back yet, right?
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.040]   If you bought the lion king on the i2 store and you didn't download it you just trusted it to be
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.800]   Downloadable in the future. It is gone for now from your library. I never download anything. I have everything
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.400]   I don't either stream up my apple tv and that's maybe we need to learn a lesson here
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.760]   You know, you don't I mean this is all completely within the terms of service
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.400]   Uh, they say very clearly you don't own this, you know, we could revoke it at any time
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:34.040]   Um, and you know, it's just not very nice. It's not a nice thing to do especially if you have kids who liked watching the lion king over and over and over again
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.520]   daddy, where's my lion king
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   Well
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.320]   Mr. Pixar decided mr. Disney decided to remove it
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:50.120]   You know that you know that scene in which in which kimba is being like held over that cliff. I imagine disney throwing kimba
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.120]   I got two words a kuna matata
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.760]   It's the circle of commercial life
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.120]   They take your money
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.440]   And don't feel obligated to deliver a service
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.960]   The circle of stockholder appeasement
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.040]   But I but I you know, I'm not just like you're nah, I don't want to store this stuff
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.880]   I got enough clutter. I like not having physical media. I don't want to waste our drive space because I can always
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.920]   Watch the movie anytime. Yeah
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.320]   And it's when you break faith with audience like that. It's really hard to get that's the
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.960]   Now I think that's the problem. It hurts. It hurts this model
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:34.120]   This is why anytime. There's a movie that I want to keep I will buy it on physical media and then rip it and I will
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.760]   I will see the fbi warning. I will say thank you fbi warning, but
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.280]   For for I'm sorry for research purposes only and then after validating that the service actually works
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:51.720]   Of course I zero out that section of the hard drive. See that's that's the unintended consequence of this kind of behavior is then that person feels
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:58.440]   Legitimate going to a bit torrent site and downloading a very nice. I read now. They're saying look I paid for this
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:06.680]   I own it. Why should I not get my copy of something that I've actually paid for and you really don't want to teach people how to do that if you're trying to fight that
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.200]   Yeah, because once they experience it they go. Hey, this this works pretty well
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.760]   Yeah, I mean I I'm amazed by how they operate in business
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.160]   I'm amazed every time I put in a blu ray and I have to go through an fbi warning
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:25.320]   I have to go through three different commercials for sometimes for things that have nothing to do with movies even and I can't skip over it
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.280]   And they're trying to tell me that this is a better thing in 10 years
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Yeah, I'm saying like
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.800]   You've already disappointed me with that movie
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   I'm sorry your copy of avengers won't play because your security chips are out of date
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.280]   Please plug in put in an incredibly long password via a playstation for a controller
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:49.080]   I hate that so much, you know, I I'm moving and so that means I have to reset up everything and god
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.160]   I hate that process of
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:58.040]   Loops didn't work wrong password. Oh, yeah, you know, you really don't have to obscure it with thoughts
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.200]   When i'm trying to type it in with a playstation controller really please don't
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.720]   And thank you for putting the hyphen on the second alternate keyboard damn you
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.680]   Painful just damn you to hell
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:17.240]   Don't you realize the fact that I use hyphens instead of spaces is why hackers cannot figure out my password
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.520]   I'm using an M's and M hyphen
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.920]   You'll never figure that out. It's Unicode 242
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.640]   I'm using the internet hyphen the internet thumbs up
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.480]   Yeah, it's my password. Okay, and in our comedy bit of the week
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.560]   Former apple ceo john skelly moles bid to buy blackberry
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.520]   Everybody else is right he's a business genius
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.440]   Um
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   All right, anything services company tonight
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.080]   Vbm
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080]   Wow, did I
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.040]   You're not you're are you using it you're Canadian you gotta use it
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:58.760]   Using it because half my friends work for crackberry and they're all bbm addicts so I I get bbm's from them was I like it or not
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.120]   God welcome welcome back to the 90s
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.760]   We had an actual fun today because I message supports animated gifts
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.560]   Which I was not aware of and I got an animated gift and I tried to use it in bbm and it couldn't get it to work
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.480]   No, of course not. They didn't have animated gifts in 1982
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.440]   That's my next feature
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:24.600]   Uh, did I miss anything anything you want guys want to talk about before we get to our picks of the week
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.960]   No, I want to talk about apple script, but we covered that
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.240]   Yeah, that that
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:37.000]   Oh the chat romass leo about mavericks and gmail because that's been a big issue lately
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.520]   Yeah tidbits tidbits article really I think in fact I didn't
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.680]   I think adam angst it was like the most red tidbits article of all time
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:52.200]   Well, dessert. I mean google has always had an eccentric i-map implementation and it's never been comfortable for me on mail
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.360]   But mail is less tolerant of it than ever before so they don't play nicely
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:01.000]   I think part of it though is that joe kissle had already done this wild work around
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.320]   And then at that broke because I have not had any trouble but um
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.120]   I don't either but I have like 40 gigs of gmail on my local machine now and he was trying to avoid that problem
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.840]   That's it's because it downloads all mail. Yeah, if you don't somehow prevent it from it
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.360]   And uh, I don't mind having all mail on there. Um, I might
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.120]   I do mind when it re downloads it. That's kind of annoying
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.440]   Especially because google puts up a bandwidth exceeded warning and stops you from downloading it for a day
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.640]   Right, even though they're google and I don't think they have any bandwidth limits quite true
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.360]   Yeah, it's kind of ironic, isn't it?
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.120]   No, they're saying i'm sorry. We can't attach ads to these as fast as you can download them
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.800]   Do you want to summarize this story because I I don't know how many people are bit by this
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.440]   I mean if you have just installed gmail, you've never done any hacks to it
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.360]   And you're using it in mail dot app you're fine
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.040]   If you've done a bunch of remaps if you've tried to eliminate the all mail folder
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.160]   Uh, then that no longer works and you're not going to have a lot of fun
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   And it is going to try to download stuff and it is going to respond deleted messages
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.480]   So you probably want to clean install
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:05.560]   Uh gmail or you want to learn look at a mail alternative like sparrow or airmail
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.960]   Or mary was dead. I actually went and tried to get sparrow but because google bought him
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.160]   It hasn't been updated in a long time. I don't know if sparrow's the right choice at this point
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.200]   Some people still like it. Apparently it still works. It's very june
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.400]   It's basically just really love google to offer google sync like if you're a paid google accounts user
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:26.920]   Let me have exchange on the desktop the way you do in mobile and I will never darken your doorstep again. Yeah
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:30.760]   Okay, so that's i'm glad
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.920]   I'm glad the chatroom reminded me of that one because that is a big that is a big story for some people
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560]   Annie and echo your pick of the week
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:44.760]   Uh my pick of the week is uh, ulysses 1.1. Oh, I love you. This is have we mentioned that before?
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:51.320]   Uh, I think I I not sure if I picked me ulysses or uh or data lists, which is their companion ios app
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.760]   Whether no matter what I did uh, they just updated it and it's a serious update that it's not a point one
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.080]   It really is more like a point five update
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:04.920]   Uh, and they added a bunch of this is a responding to the users of the users who love our product
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.160]   Sort of update with a lot of requested features
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.200]   What I like and I didn't if this has been in the previous release. I did not see it
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.680]   And it's in the release notes. So I'm going to trust that this is a new feature
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.160]   Um, I like the way that they're using style sheets now or rather interpreting
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.240]   They've they've been they've enhanced the idea of what a tech space editor is for
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.680]   What ulysses is so great at is that I think it's the perfect bridge between an app like bb edit
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.920]   Which is still the app you want if you're writing code?
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:39.240]   Uh and scrivener, which is still the app you want if you've got a complicated writing project that involves lots of research lots of notes lots of construction
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.560]   lots of lots lots of uh architecture behind it
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:46.360]   Uh, ulysses is the perfect bridge because like scrivener
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   It puts all of your text files in one place and allows you to organize them and impose some sort of order of it
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.600]   Like bb edit though. It is a text based word processor where
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.880]   All of the formatting and all the markup you're doing is being done by actually embedding codes in there
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:08.200]   So the overall idea is that you're just going to write you're not going to worry about where this is going to wind up
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.320]   You're just going to mark it up to so that uh, so that you
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:17.480]   You've uh encouraged your intent for this word should be boldface. This should be a headline. This should be formatted as a sidebar
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.800]   And then only
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   I'm sorry reading their web page
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.800]   They've got a sense of humor. The soul men do they are soul men. Yes, donna, donna, donna, donna
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.680]   Uh, the but the but the idea is that only at the when you are ready to deploy it
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:41.080]   Will it actually convert all the markup into whatever it is your target wants so that if you want if you're if your target is a word
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.560]   File at that point all of your markup turns into actual, you know, microsoft word style boldface
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:51.400]   If you were putting this on the web only then does does your markup turn into html or style sheets
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:57.240]   Uh, what I like about 1.1. I'm this is why i'm using i've really started using it on an upcoming project that i'm working on
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.040]   Uh, that it allows if you if i'm doing something that was going to be published on the web
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.520]   It requires a lot of like clever little markup stuff
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:10.680]   And the the most soul-sapping part of this every time is formatting this big header block that has to be all kinds of
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.520]   complicated css
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.920]   Uh, and actually get tailing back to apple script
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.480]   I've used to use use bb edit for this and simply run a script that will take like
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:28.600]   Settings 1 2 3 4 and put all this complicated css and html on it with ulysses what you can do is simply define here is what
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.840]   Here give a give a fine grained
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.360]   Definition of here is what I mean when I mean this markup tag here's what this markup tag should be
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:41.320]   And here's how you should reformat this when I try to deploy this over here as opposed to over here
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.160]   And so you can simply focus on just simply arbitrarily tagging things
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.280]   Uh, making a document that's easily read by i and only when you're done with it
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:56.600]   And when you sort of burn a copy to disc so to speak does it turn into this really really well formatted well commented css
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.040]   An html file. So, uh, it's nice for that again
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.440]   There are people who are real acolytes of plaintext editing
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.520]   I'm not in that cat in that camp yet
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.400]   Because I do like being able to see something bold in front of me as i'm typing boldface
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.880]   You know the radical ideas like that
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.400]   But again, I think it's it fills a necessary gap between
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:23.720]   Of a formal word processor like scrivener and a text only editor like bb edit
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.640]   If you are in at all in any way interested in plaintext editing
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:33.400]   I think it's the way to go not only for all the features that i've talked about but also because it does have that really nice companion app
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.880]   for ios so
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.960]   Until these really great
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.840]   Until until scrivener for ios gets released which I hopefully released in 2014
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.080]   I'm finding it to be the easiest way to have a complicated multi document
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.440]   Production synced easily between an ipad and and the mac
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:58.280]   I bought it at least these two and i'm wondering I didn't upgrade it should i cuz it's a 45 dollar upgrade
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.800]   Yeah, i'm about to say it's it's not cheap
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.040]   It's 45 bucks, but this is the going rate for a professionally written app that will help you save time and effort and and energy
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.680]   I think I think it's worth that amount of money
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:12.520]   You should you should evaluate that it's the right app for what you want to do again
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:19.880]   If you are if you are very very happy with pages and it would sort of bum you out to have suddenly have to type underscores to italicize things
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.840]   Uh, and you are not finding a real big problem with your workflow as it is
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:31.160]   I don't think your lis is going to help you but if you're editing it all at any time is i'm writing this
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.080]   It's kind of wind up in an e-book or i'm writing this and this is going to wind up in the web
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.840]   Uh, and i'm really tired. I have to go out and go out and get myself a drink before I come back to the house
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.640]   And prepare this as an epub as the final step
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:47.560]   Uh an editor like you lis is can save you a lot of time and a lot of energy
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.960]   Of because of the way it's natured if you like mark up you'll love you lis is
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:57.000]   That is Andy's pick. How about you rene ritchie? What do you got for us?
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.040]   I have two and I added one after we were discussing hypercard. Um, there's apps like hype
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:06.440]   Which let you do a lot of really cool almost flash-like animation using css
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.480]   But if you've got web development experience, you might still want to roll your own so there's this book out called
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:17.960]   It's fairly new called css transforms and interactive guide and it's by vicky murley who until last year
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:23.720]   I think was apples safari technology evangelist so she really really knows her stuff
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:29.000]   And if you look at apples product pages, you can see they're doing a lot of really interesting things
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   With css transformations and you just will just web technologies in general
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:39.480]   So if you if you understand css already, but you want to start doing all the fancy stuff that the apple kids are doing
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.400]   Um, I bought this the day it came out. Um, I'm working my way through it
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:47.480]   It's easy enough for me to understand and I have very little web dev background
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.600]   Um, I can't recommend this book enough. Unfortunately, it was written in iBooks author
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:58.040]   So it's only ipad compatible and and now mac compatible thanks to mavericks. It doesn't work on the iphone
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.840]   But if you're doing web dev, you probably want a big screen, you know to have next to you as a reference anyway
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.960]   So I would absolutely check that out at css transforms and interactive guide by vicky murley
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.360]   All right, but your inner hypercard out with new based web technology
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:19.080]   In a geek out and my other pick is no great surprise to anybody who exists on the internet. It is twitterific
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.280]   Love tree which just came out
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.760]   Uh, I remember I was at the ws
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.080]   Tweetbot you're talking about tweetbot. Sorry tweetbot. I apologize tweet
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:36.200]   Is also fantastic when you said version three that wait a minute. That's tweetbot and chat agree. Yeah. Yeah, it's absolutely fantastic
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:41.560]   I was at the wwc keynote and I saw paul haddad the developer right afterwards and he had this look on his face
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.400]   Like apple had just given him a brand new bag of toys to play with
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:50.520]   And I believe he's not just using ui dynamics, but he's rolled a lot of his own physics
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.040]   But it's got delightful little touches like when you want to change one of those
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.160]   Things you hold it down and a little bubbles just pop up or when you want to go to your account
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.360]   The little everything is is very nicely animated
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:09.560]   Everyone was kind of wondering what tweetbot would do because they had so much character as a richly textured application
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.600]   Uh, you know
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:17.720]   It was almost a poster child for what the ios 6 look could do if you made it incredibly characterized and turned into a personality
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.360]   And it wasn't clear what ios 7 would mean for them
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:26.040]   But just like letterpress in a way they took all that personality and they made it dynamic and interactive
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:32.440]   With blurs and physics and bounces and collisions and you can you know tap a photo the photo pops up
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.640]   You can spin it around you can throw it away like a card
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:42.040]   It's full of all those delightful little interactions paul and mark even gave themselves their own little verified by twitter badges
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.520]   Which you can see there verified by tap bots
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:51.080]   And it's it's sort of the spiritual successor for tweedy, which was always my favorite out on the road
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.800]   triage get stuff done app
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:58.840]   I use twitterific on my ipad because i'm my ipad i just want to read and i like the unified timeline for that
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:04.200]   But when i'm on my iphone and especially when i'm out and about and i just want to get through twitter, you know reply
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.080]   triage stuff as fast as i can
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.960]   I always go back to twitterific because it's it's workflow makes so much logical sense for me
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.600]   There are some features because they rewrote the entire app that didn't make it into the new version
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.600]   But they are adding that they are adding
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.160]   Right now they're using system fonts for the dynamic text and they're going to add independent fonts
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.520]   They're going to add a night mode if you want to turn the interface dark again
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.840]   So there's a lot of stuff coming in the next update, but for now it's a fantastic rewrite
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.800]   It is a new app if you bought it before you do have to buy it again tweed bot 2 was free
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.560]   And unfortunately paul and mark both have little kids they want to feed so they are charging
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:44.840]   Three bucks right now on sale for the new version. I use it eight hours a day every day
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.640]   So they could easily charge me 30 bucks and i wouldn't blink
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.560]   But it is only three bucks for now. So if you want to upgrade i encourage you to do so
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.040]   You know post-haste and this is the ios version not the ios 7
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.560]   Ios 7 because yeah, I use it on this also on the desktop. I love tweed bot
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.800]   I like twitterific too
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.720]   And of course the late limited tweetee
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.560]   They are very different workflows from like that. That's what i like about twitter
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:12.520]   And you know john gruber says a long time ago. It's a playground for designers and you can make very different experiences with the same
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.000]   core technology, right
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.480]   uh, we mentioned
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:23.400]   Air mail i don't i know i like apple mail a lot and the main reason i stick with apple mail even if there are gmail problems
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.400]   Which i haven't really had too much problem with
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:30.360]   Uh, is because i like to use uh, pgp encryption i use the gpg tools i've mentioned before
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.280]   And it seems like that's the i want to put out the word to all the
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.280]   Email, you know third party email clients support
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:45.720]   Pgp or gpg just because then it would be so nice everybody could say oh yeah get this and it would work
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.000]   Nobody does that to my knowledge yet if anybody has a suggestion i would love it
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.200]   But you mentioned air mail and air mail is actually a really nice
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:57.160]   Interface if you use a gmail to get into your gmail
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.720]   Uh, it's just it's pretty it's simple. It gets the job done
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.840]   Um, and i highly i recommend i have to be careful when i show my
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:12.760]   Email, okay, there we go. This is the three-pane interface. Do you use this rina you mentioned it?
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.240]   I have fried it i i
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:21.720]   I'm going through this big dilemma now because i i'm a huge mail dot app user but you're taking up so much space on my computer
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.280]   And i don't need all that available so either i'm going to move to air mail or i'm going to lock
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.640]   Gmail up in chrome next to flash in sort of a jail if you like sparrow and you're saying well
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.880]   It's kind of dead because google bottom and they're not
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:42.120]   Improving it i think this is a good a really good choice air mail. It's cheap buck 99 app store of course desktop app
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:50.520]   I think it's great and i down i paid for it download and installed it, but i just i don't i don't use it that much because i'm a mail user
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:52.840]   It's from bloop
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.520]   We read out yeah
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.760]   Ladies and gentlemen that concludes this edition of macabrick weekly we did think
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.000]   Alex would be able to join us from a wanda. He says he has more bandwidth than god, but no where to sit
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.640]   Isn't it always that way that's a third with no chairs
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:16.600]   So uh, maybe he'll come back, but uh, he could not be here today in case you were tuning in and wonder where he was
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.200]   Oh, I forgot. I did have a better pick. It's this the hypercard script language guide

[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.640]   I'm excited by the a7. I cannot wait to get my ipad mini with retina display a7 chip
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.840]   Etc, etc. I was talking to brian clug about it
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.800]   And you know I was asking him is it too much for the iphone or too little for the ipad because how can they have the same chip?
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.240]   And he said it is
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:29.000]   Literally a desktop class processor that has no business being in a phone that apple just yeah, and it's ridiculous
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.760]   How much power is that so exciting and I just wish they would get the I am going to be camping on the apple store
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:38.040]   I figure I know I have a couple of weeks before I have to do that
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.600]   But starting about november 15th
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.600]   Every night midnight coop routine of time. I'm going to log into the apple store and just try to buy an ipad mini with
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.920]   I'm sure they'll announce that I don't think they'll try to surprise anybody
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:56.680]   But they'll but maybe they'll announce it. Yeah, maybe i'm I don't want to miss the announcement. Yeah, I want it. I want it
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.560]   Andy and ico
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   Chicago sun times
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.160]   baseball fan
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.360]   He will be glued to the television set this coming wednesday
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.920]   I will be down if there's a game seven. I will be answering the door in my official costume as anoint person
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.080]   Who really didn't want to be taken away from the game. It's not too late to start growing a beard
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.160]   I really bushy bosecx beard
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.760]   Exactly, that is this I just I just hope it doesn't affect their balance as
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.160]   The longer the longer they go the more can affect their swing and that's that's problematic
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.320]   They're all looking like the unibomber now
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.000]   Uh, we make some make some scary make some scary
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.480]   We do also what also and this this is this is actually a question that I really wanted seriously answered now
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:49.160]   They've got now not something have these huge beards. Okay, so now they can sort of like in like sort of extend their beard into the strike zone
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.560]   So if the ball just hits their beard, do they get the base?
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:59.160]   That actually that actually happened he had with the elbow guard on there and had like three inches to his elbow hit by pitch
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.040]   There he go very handy and it doesn't hurt
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.400]   Next person they may come. Can we like is it too late to sign ZZ top like a you know pinch hitter
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:15.640]   There's a guy who bicycles around petaluma who has a big long gray beard that he splits in the middle
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.440]   And it has it's like a mustache beard, you know with a little waxed ends
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:26.280]   Well, probably it's probably it's not split in the middle. It's probably the arc reactor he installed probably burned off that that's such a hair
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.320]   We do mac break weekly at 11 a.m. Pacific time
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440]   That is 2 p.m. Eastern time
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:42.600]   Currently 1,800 UTC, but next week we go to summertime here in the United States, which means our clocks will change
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.640]   But of course UTC does not which means we will change UTC time that figure that out
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.200]   It'll be 1,800 ut
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.400]   1,900 UTC instead of 1,800
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.240]   So next to next week you do the math
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.640]   Because I've really challenged it's exact Zulu
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.640]   Uh, so i'll say it again 11 a.m. Pacific that's not going to change
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:12.280]   Uh 2 p.m. Eastern time that's not going to change because we move the show
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.000]   Uh, but UTC will change because you don't observe summertime figure that out
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.720]   1,900 UTC
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:28.600]   Well, Greenwich Observatory is in London. They don't really get very as much summertime weather. So why bother that why bother changing
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.960]   They don't have to get up at sunrise
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:38.120]   To milk the cows. They're already miserable harvest the summertime is over. It is over
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:44.920]   Is it over in Canada already? No, we we copied the u.s. Because we moved just really afraid of missing our television shows at the proper times
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.160]   I've got a big dish aimed at Detroit. I don't want to miss it
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.560]   Now what what you're did you do that?
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.040]   I'm trying to figure out the last time american television broadcast tell which would have been so good that I would consider
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.600]   The standard
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.600]   We were petrified of being left behind
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.160]   Thank you everybody for being here
