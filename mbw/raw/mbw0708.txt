[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Renee and Laurie are here and there's lots to talk
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.520]   about the new Apple Clips, Tim Cook, and his video from, I don't know, the Apple store
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   in his living room.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.400]   We'll talk about Quibi, the new short format app, iPhone SE Leaks, and how did Amazon Prime
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.680]   get that good deal from Apple?
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   Another brick in the pack.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.880]   This episode of Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by ZipRecruiter.

[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we get the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.520]   Alex Lindsey's very busy these days.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.920]   Who knew? People want to stream all of a sudden conferences, meetings, everything.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   So Alex has the day off, but we've got the other core members of the team starting with
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.160]   Laurie Gill from iMore.com.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.680]   She has not yet gone out on her own, right?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   Not yet.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.160]   She's still at iMore, managing in her alcoholic.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   Still there.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   Renee, Richie is.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   Go ahead.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160]   Say whatever you wish.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.120]   I was just going to mention how much help I will need from Alex.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120]   My friends and I have been trying to figure out ways to have home concerts where we're
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.640]   not actually leaving the house, but we're streaming live to things.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.080]   We've been able to figure out some stuff on our own pretty well, but I keep thinking,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.960]   "Oh man, Alex could really help us with this."
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.280]   So I can't even talk really fast.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.560]   Sink is the hard part, right?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   Getting everybody in sync.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.880]   Because I'll wait and see.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.800]   Yeah, that's a big one, definitely.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Figuring out how to stream to a social media service when you're using, when everyone's
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.240]   in separate places to group streaming is hard.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600]   Yeah, well one person has to be the host.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.120]   The host, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.320]   We were recommending a site you might check out called Jammer, gammar.com.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   Okay.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.120]   And it's designed to do exactly that to Musically Jam online.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.960]   Yes, I like it.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Is it .com?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   Maybe it's not .com.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   It's .net.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   Sorry.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   JAMMR.net.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.800]   Renee, Richie is on his own.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.560]   How's week two of Independence treating you?
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.600]   I'm trying to, I imagine Alex isn't really not here.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.120]   He's secretly like the architect in the Matrix plugged into every live stream that's going
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   to work right now.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   That's probably true.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.480]   But I've been distracting myself with just not realizing how much you actually have to
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.160]   reset up from scratch when you don't have a massive media organization behind you anymore.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.880]   Just peddling as fast as I can.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   You're growing well though.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.560]   Good to see the channel growth.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Thank you.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.960]   And Andy Inako is here, always independent.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   Never been anything but, right?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.600]   I'm no longer housebroken for office work, so I'm no longer a better.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.400]   Andy's with Boston Public Radio, but also I would say as much an important part of our
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.280]   team as anything else.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.080]   Yeah, we really appreciate it.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.040]   I seem to have lost control of the switcher, so we're just going to, the whole show will
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.600]   be looking at me.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.200]   I have lots, I have lots to say.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.880]   Andy, you finally got your wish.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.640]   As the youngest child, it was hard to make my own mark, particularly in a big city such
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.080]   as Boston, Massachusetts, predominantly Catholic and Irish.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.320]   I was only one of those, but still...
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.920]   Can't stop it.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   John!
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.000]   I still have control, John, but my keys don't seem to do anything.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.080]   Let me Andy Inako take control of the horizontal
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   land of vertical.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.840]   This is even better.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.680]   This is the six CD box set of all the music from all the...
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.600]   Oh, yeah, that was a documentary.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   That's entertainment.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   Yeah, that was wonderful.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Yeah, three volumes.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   Yeah, love it.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.200]   I'm continuing to reorganize my music library and it's getting very, very expensive because
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.680]   I have a separate folder for incomplete CDs.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.360]   If years ago I ripped just a few tracks but forgot to rip the rest of it.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.960]   And as I'm going through this, I'm going, "Oh, wow, that box set.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.280]   Why don't I have all of it?"
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   And then because I lost the original CD, so let's go on to eBay and buy now that box.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.560]   It's a clip show and there's narration, right, as I remember.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.600]   Not only that, but it's all of the best musical numbers from...
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Right.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.400]   And that's really important because remember that a lot of these amazing musical numbers
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.840]   came out of really, really not that great movies.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.320]   You don't want to have to watch the whole movie.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.320]   So that is...
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.200]   Yeah, there's like one of my favorite musical sequences of all time came from, again, a
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.880]   terrible, terrible movie but it's like the best dancing centuries ever did.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.440]   And I would say like the most...
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.080]   In the history of cinema, if you're going to talk about the 50 hottest scenes in movies,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.400]   this dance sequence with her dance partner would be one of the best.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.360]   But it's not only that, but it's also behind the scenes stuff.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.760]   It's also like Citries and Jean Kelly in 1980 talking about the past.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.160]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   But yeah, that was part three with the...
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   Is this the one where they do the Apache dance in the nightclub and he's throwing her
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.840]   around and she's wearing this name?
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.560]   No, no, this is...
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.160]   It was a...
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   Royal wedding.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   No, no, this was from...
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.160]   It's called "Mine Alone."
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   It went essentially...
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   Oh, she saw it.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.320]   Yeah, I think it's one of those biographical musicals where they just...
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   We need an excuse to do like...
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   A lot of dancing.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   A lot of dancing.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   Candor and Ed music.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   Okay, so we'll do the history of Candor, the biography of Candor and Ed.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.840]   And it's basically...
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.440]   She is trying to...
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.320]   There's this Prince who's...
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.960]   She's spurned and she's trying to get back with them and so they dance, but then they
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   realize it's not going to work out, but it is again...
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   I'll find...
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.680]   It is such a forgettable movie that I have forgotten the name of the movie, but I will
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.400]   try to bring that up.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.520]   The scene I was talking about was called "The Girl Hunt Ballet" from the band...
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.080]   It's an amazing scene.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   No, no, no, yes.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Fred Astaire and Citrese.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   I thought she was the best.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.920]   I just loved Citrese.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   Citrese, she was athletic.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   She's graceful.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.040]   She had a lot of stuff together.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   And also I think she was definitely Astaire's best partner.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.440]   Okay, so it's from the movie "Deep in My Heart" 1954.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.040]   Citrese with James Mitchell, it's actually on YouTube.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.440]   And you will see...
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.400]   You will see this is like the sales brochure for like if there had to be a marketing campaign
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.520]   for digging women saying that men, women, maybe you should be digging women.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.880]   Here, check out our marketing brochure.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.240]   This would be the...
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   I see...
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.520]   Even if you have no use for that product, you would see why that product is so marketable.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   She...
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.600]   This was like 54 too.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.880]   She was something.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.040]   As Fred Astaire said, once you've danced with Citrese, what did he say?
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   Something like...
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.040]   You've been a dance.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040]   You've been a dance.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.040]   Yeah, I think that's what he said.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   Stay danced.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.640]   Anyway, we're not here to talk about Hollywood musicals, although at this point we may be
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.400]   talking about Hollywood musicals soon.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.600]   However, there is some Apple news.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.400]   You saw what Tim Cook tweeted.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.880]   I thought that was really something.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   Apple has...
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   What did they say?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   20 million face masks for healthcare workers.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.760]   These are new.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   These are being made.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.520]   And he's also...
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.760]   Apple has designed its own flat pack mask for healthcare workers.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   Face shields.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Face shields.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.800]   And he says, "We can manufacture these at a million of them a week."
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Tell me, I'll just play a little bit of the Tim tweet.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   Before you do this, Leo, and before we get really serious, can I just say that it looks
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   like he has Apple retail version 2.0 quality shelves behind him for his sports memorabilia.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   Oh, he does.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   Just so on, Brad.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.800]   It's that beautiful blonde cedar.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   It's pretty cool.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.000]   He also has a War Eagle Auburn signed basketball behind him.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.360]   A couple of them it looks like.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.040]   So Ray, are you accusing the CEO, Tim Cook, of like pilfering stuff from the Apple warehouse?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.400]   I think he built it himself.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.040]   I'm now asking who built the shelves in all the new stores.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.400]   He did it by himself.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.120]   Look, it's even got that nice embedded track lighting.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.520]   Yeah, quite lovely.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.080]   And this video was better than the last video because he didn't...
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.120]   Like he started and stopped it less awkwardly.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.040]   Like he's improving his live Insta social feed content every week.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.280]   I have to say though, I love it that it has that thing where they start and then they
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.800]   sit back and at the end they come step forward and stop it.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   I'm guessing...
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.280]   You can edit those.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.000]   I'm guessing that that was almost an affectation, right?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.640]   Which is where he wanted the vertical video and clips still doesn't support that.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   That's interesting.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.520]   We'll get to the store we're supposed to be talking about.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.680]   While we're on this, don't you think that this is going to feed just like the iPhone
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   and the success of the design of the iPhone was a response to how much Apple engineers
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.520]   hated their current trio phones and their current Windows phones.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.320]   Don't you think that Apple is going to have one hell of a killer new version of FaceTime
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.120]   or a conversing app just based on like, "Okay, there's got to be a way that we don't have
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120]   to...
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.760]   Our users don't have to reach up and touch something in order to get this.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.680]   Can we like AI our way around deleting that automatically?"
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.680]   This...
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.760]   The Face Shield, according to the associate executive director of the Permanente Medical
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.200]   Group for Kaiser Permanente Northern California, helps preserve valuable personal protective
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.560]   equipment for a longer period of time.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   Smita Ruayard said, "It really renews your energy and your spirit."
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.680]   So they were very grateful.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.760]   They were very grateful to have it.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.400]   I think that's really cool.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.600]   And it is, by the way, I want to point out the thinnest Face Shield Apple has ever made.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.480]   So there's a lot to be said.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   Great battery life.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.080]   But a great battery life.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   She's going to reach forward.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   Stay safe and stay healthy.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   We're not the insensitive group.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   It turned off.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   We're laughing because we're crying.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   No, we're not insensitive.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   You know what?
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.120]   You have to be a little black humor in the face of all this, right?
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.720]   That's why I'm always looking at memes.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.520]   I'm always looking at COVID memes.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.200]   They just make me feel a little bit better.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   That's why I'm rewatching Tiger King for the eighth time.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.960]   Oh, did those tigers test positive too?
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   Apparently, there were some tigers in the zoo.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.120]   At least one testing positive, which is...
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   They said veterinary tests are very different from human tests.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.440]   So don't be upset that the tiger got ahead of you in line.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.360]   Actually my son, who as you know, flew back from Bali.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.880]   He'd been in Vietnam and Thailand and Bali.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   And finally I talked to him on the March 28th to fly back.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:40.200]   He flew back via Tokyo, arrived in the States, was not tested or temperature or anything.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.320]   They said, "Yeah, come on in kid, come on in."
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.600]   But we've been kind of sequestering him.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.440]   We got him an Airbnb and he's staying there and he's been there now for 10 days.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.080]   Starting to come down with symptoms.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.800]   So I don't know what it could be if it's not COVID.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.120]   He hasn't seen or touched anything or anybody.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.480]   So I'm a little nervous.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   He calls his doctor, the guy says, "We don't test.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   We can't test.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   We don't have any tests."
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   Well, we're going to tell you what I would tell anybody.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   Don't leave.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   Don't go out now.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.160]   You can't go shopping, can't do anything.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.480]   So I'm going to be sending him food and stuff.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.120]   And he said, "If you have trouble breathing, call us back."
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   That's it.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.560]   Chris Cuomo has been giving tips on how he's getting through it.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.120]   Stay bundled up, but walk around.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.120]   Make sure you take your meds, but don't stop breathing.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.480]   It's nice to be a celebrity because you can get a test if you're famous.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.560]   But the rest of the world is just going.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   Of course, Johnson's in ICU.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   I know.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   Terrible.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   Terrible.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.480]   Well, that's why it's so valuable.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.120]   Part of my thinking kind of evolved a week and a half ago the first time I read someone
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   I'm read it or think.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.920]   I think basically went day by day, step to step.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.120]   I'm recovered now, but here's what I was feeling.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.360]   Here's what I was going through every day.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.520]   That basically gave me a template for, "Okay, assume that I start to feel sick tomorrow
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.560]   and I'm not a jerk so I don't want to."
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   So exactly.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   I don't want to leave the house.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.040]   What will I need to have in the house to be able to take care of myself?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.120]   Not just, I already had a couple of weeks of food, but now it's like, "Do you have ibuprofen?
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.480]   Do you have a gatorade or whatever for dehydration?
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.320]   Is the house in the bedroom like clean, tidy enough that you can basically use it as a
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   sick room?"
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.480]   So again, not hope not the plan.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.600]   I don't know what the right word is.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.440]   Not expecting the worst, but at least being ready for anything that happens.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.680]   I think that's sensible.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.640]   And that's what we're all doing right now.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.600]   Yeah, because if I would have, if I have the foresight, I would have planned for running
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.320]   out of toilet paper and not having any disinfectant wipes in the house.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.840]   But you would have had to plan that long ago.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   That's the problem.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.120]   And who thought who knew?
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   We'll know next time.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.520]   We'll be ready next time.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.200]   And planning for the possibility of getting sick.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   I think one of the most important things, just like what you're saying, is plan to not
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.600]   leave your house the moment you have any kind of symptoms.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.480]   That's the most important thing, because you don't want to spread something.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.920]   You don't want to run up to the store and get some ibuprofen while you've got a fever.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.320]   That's the worst thing you could do.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:16.960]   So planning, get your bug out box ready and make sure that you have tissue paper for blowing
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.680]   your nose or things like that, just in that box.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.280]   So that if there's a reason why you end up having to be stuck in your house for 14 or
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.440]   more days, and you can't leave the house because you don't want to spread anything under any
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.880]   circumstance, not even for a walk, that's where you want to make sure you have those
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   exercises.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well, that's why Henry is just down.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   He's very nearby.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   He's just down the road of peace.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   So we can bring him food.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   That's good.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   And I said, you can get takeout.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.080]   Just leave it on the porch and all of that stuff.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.400]   So I could just be allergies.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.680]   We're all suffering a little bit from that.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   I don't know.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.600]   I'm hoping crossing my fingers.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.320]   But yeah, just take care.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   Take care, everybody.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.800]   Now I don't know why Tim didn't use a mimoji on his video.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.920]   Maybe it wasn't projected to shareholders that he had.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.840]   But I am so like we have just completely handed over responsibility to this to our corporate
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   overlords.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   And there's a bunch of science fiction shows about how the corporations take over and
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.400]   it starts with them just making all the masks.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   Oh, the time has come.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Time has come.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   This is it.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   Time for the big land grab.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.160]   This is when you want Tim.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.920]   Tim's whole thing is logistics and designing and getting a product from design to manufacturing
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   to market.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.640]   So this is the sort of person that maybe now I'm no longer quite so skeaved out that he
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.720]   has that he's he and and Trump have have a good relationship because maybe it's time
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   for him to say, yeah, here's here's some numbers I want you to call.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.520]   Here's here's what I want you to tell them.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.360]   And that will result in more and more equipment being manufactured and being put to the right
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   places.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.880]   Had he used clips, he could have done them as iPad.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.160]   Now there's iPad cursor support.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.800]   New stickers, clips is you know, it's funny because Apple made a big deal about it when
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.880]   they released it and they do continue to update it and add new things.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.360]   I just wonder how many people use it.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.600]   I guess the point of clips was kind of a video editor for people making Snapchat and Instagram
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.920]   story videos, things like that or videos talking about your new face masks.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.000]   But they still can't like they still.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.200]   So I did see a few people on Instagram do really cool videos and I asked what they used
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.640]   and they did say clips.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.800]   But for a lot of like, that's fine for the post you put in your timeline.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:38.000]   But until it supports nine by sixteen, you can't get those full screen Snapchat or TikTok
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.680]   or Insta stories videos.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.760]   And I think that's where this would really shine.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.960]   You know what I'm hoping?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.440]   I'm hoping quibby open sources.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.080]   It's remarkable technology.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.640]   Have you played this at a expensive that is outside the US?
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   They don't have the free tier.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.480]   You don't get to play with it.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   So you're missing.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.200]   You pay like eight times as much for zero.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.680]   You're missing dish mantel the game where they shoot contestants in protective gear of
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.720]   course with food, make them taste it and then cook it.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.320]   But this is the thing I was talking about.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.560]   And by the way, you have to watch a short it's only a short ad.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.560]   But this is the thing I was talking about.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.720]   They're just kind of remarkable.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   Quibby, which is of course Jeffrey Katzenberg, formerly of SKG in Disney and Meg Whitman,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.520]   formerly of HP, billion dollar startup.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.320]   They raised a billion dollars to make short form videos for the iPhone generation I guess.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.160]   But their whole thing, and this is what they showed on CES was watching this.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.640]   So I'm watching it in portrait mode.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.720]   And now seamlessly, it just flips around to why you don't almost do it.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.160]   Don't even see it happening to widescreen landscape.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.360]   That feels like a feature Instagram or TikTok should add though.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.800]   It doesn't feel like something I should pay more than Disney Plus for like new videos.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   It didn't do it.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   Oh, there we go.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   Never find yourself.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   This is the phone.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   This is the phone.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   That's right.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   That's right.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Your phone.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.360]   So I think this would be a nice feature for Snapchat or Instagram or Facebook or somebody
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   to do.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   I love this.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   Do you think it's hard?
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Is it technically difficult?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   It's not working.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.720]   I think like there was a really good, I think Jason Snow link a story about how the NFL
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.440]   changed their graphics to make sure that whether you were watching portrait landscape, you'd
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.680]   get all the data into it.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.600]   And that's what I actually my new YouTube channel.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.000]   I'm making sure everything is centered and will fit within nine by 16 as well as the
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   team.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   That's what they did with this, right?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.080]   That's the constraint is that you have to remember that you have to everything has to
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.880]   happen kind of in the middle, which is unfortunate from a composition point of view.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.560]   But I guess to make it so that it works in both portraits.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   All those eyeballs watching in bed, Leo, with a phone being held in landscape is where
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.640]   in portrait orientation.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.800]   By the way, Renee, don't worry.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.520]   You're not missing anything.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.240]   Yeah, I was surprised to find that it was five bucks a month because that's not a whole
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.920]   lot of at a time where five bucks a month can buy you a lot.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.760]   It's not a lot.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.680]   And when Disney wasn't, you know, it's a lot.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.400]   It's a lot of high production value.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   Oh, very high.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   I mean, it is.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.360]   It is HBO Netflix network TV production values.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.200]   So, you know, I mean, it depends on what you like, you know, like, honestly, I don't
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.040]   think TV plus is worth worth what it is right now.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.160]   I don't find I think there's one show that I watch on it that I like.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.560]   So this is the same thing.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   It's Oh, the M night channel on one, which I can't even remember the name.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Oh, you mean on Apple TV?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   Servant.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Servant.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   You haven't finished it, obviously.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   I finished the first season.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   Oh, you did.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.560]   Because I found that last episode like, well, that was a waste of time.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   My assumption is that the second season will, you know, do some more for us.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.240]   Apparently, Quibby's does not own that technology.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   At least there's a tech company EKO, which says, no, no, we invented that.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.120]   And Quibi is countersuing saying they want a declaration from Los Angeles district court
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.600]   saying they did not infringe on Echo's technology and demands that echo withdraw the notice of
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.360]   complaint of infringement it filed to Apple's app store.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.040]   They must have resolved it because it's in the app store, right?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.400]   We'll say, I mean, yes.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.840]   They have, EKO said it filed a patent for its horizontal to vertical video technology
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   in 2015.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:34.100]   And Quibi did not patent the same technology till 2019, which came after, quote, a confidential
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:40.180]   demo by EKO of the technology to key Quibi top executives, including some of Quibi's
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.020]   so-called patent inventors and Quibi chairman and founder Jeffrey Katzenberg.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.060]   Oh, whoopsies.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.660]   Oh, Quibi has sued, but EKO has not.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.940]   So they're trying to, this is an older story.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.180]   So I don't know what the upshot this is back.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.340]   No, this is March 9th.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.340]   It's only a month old.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.620]   Anyway, it did launch.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.980]   So they must have got injunctive relief of some kind.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.060]   I don't know.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.620]   I feel like it's, I told Micah on iOS today, earlier today, I feel like it's a little patronizing
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:16.660]   Hollywood looking at YouTube saying, how do we get some of that YouTube eyeball, ship
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.300]   and money and saying, well, we can make it better than that.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.660]   And really all it is is it's clones of existing reality TV shows and existing.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.020]   Isn't it like what a movie would come out with like surfing or comic book would come
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.580]   out like the silver surfer or the or dazzler with roller blades?
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.620]   And it was always like three years after your kids thought that that was cool.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.060]   It's like that how long it took for it to get to me.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.060]   It takes a little time.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.780]   It feels a little like that little patronizing, but you know what?
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.580]   I know I wish him well.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.060]   Well, it's about as Katzenberg, I think he said that it's not about content.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.460]   It's about platform.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.180]   And so you want to have you want to basically create your own platform that you control
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.860]   absolutely, resolutely.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.900]   And I was trying I had a note like a week or two ago to look into something that some
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.740]   a couple of people in the creative community were saying that one of the reasons for the
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.020]   short form video is that it means that they absolute whoever is creating content doesn't
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.980]   necessarily have to fall within union guidelines for long form content.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.100]   And that's like, so it's not so when you do all this stuff.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.220]   Oh, hey, this is all about short, important.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.420]   This is how people consume it.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.620]   It's like, no, maybe you just don't want to actually have to.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.940]   I think Jeffrey Katzenberg has spent a lifetime being annoyed by paying creators.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:39.460]   I think also the difference is that YouTube created was created organically.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.500]   It came up from the grassroots, right?
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.220]   And people lots of people did lots of stuff.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.780]   The audience decided what it liked.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.940]   It wasn't Hollywood stars.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.860]   It wasn't in fact Hollywood style production.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.340]   The lengths no one knew at the right length was in fact, I think I've seen evidence that
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.940]   longer we still have longer videos are now starting to do better on YouTube than they
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.940]   used to.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940]   And so forth.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   So it's...
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.980]   You know, to Andy's point, like it...
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.060]   And I saw someone previously say that it felt like they made a TV show and then instead
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.660]   of cutting it into the episode, they cut it at every commercial break just to make them
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.660]   shorter.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.420]   But like they could easily just put it together and they would be a show.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.140]   Yeah, that's for the episodic stuff.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.660]   It's seven minutes and there's...
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.340]   And in order to watch the next episode, guess what?
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.460]   You got to watch another commercial.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.060]   You can't pay eight dollars a month and get the commercial free version.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.060]   I think it's worth trying everybody's doing it, 300,000 downloads in the first week.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.900]   It's 90 days free trial.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.500]   Yeah, if they launch the new Reno 911 during that time, I'll check it out.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.940]   Are they doing Reno 911?
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   Yes.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.940]   Yes.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.860]   They even have a promo that got like almost the entire cast together only and there's
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.460]   still them and it's great.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.340]   It's just that they now all look like 15 years older.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.780]   And so it's a different story when these people have been like in these same jobs for 15 years.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.180]   Yeah, a little more bitter maybe, a little burnout.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.060]   Again, I should just point out our 15th anniversary coming up in two weeks.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.980]   A little burnt out.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.460]   I'm not going to talk.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:11.500]   We like to say, we started right when Reno 911 did and I'm hoping to get on Quibi next
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   week.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.460]   No, yeah, we're actually going to Kevin Rose.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.260]   We're going to do the anniversary thing with Kevin Rose and Robert Herron and Patrick Norton,
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.420]   special Twit Sunday, April 19th.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.900]   You're all invited.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.980]   And I think we're going to have some cameo drop buys.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:36.820]   Although in this in this COVID world drop by means a Skype call from some big, big names.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.020]   Well, at least one sort of big name.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.860]   Big stars are easier to get when they're super, super bored and stuck at home, I think.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:49.540]   Yeah, I'm waiting for a call to set up an interview with remember in the Sopranos Adriana
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.540]   Drea de Lattéo.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.540]   She's great.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.540]   I love her.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:58.060]   She was in the JLo show, the blue show.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:04.780]   She's doing a Sopranos rewatch podcast where she and her friends rewatch the Sopranos, which
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.660]   HBO is kindly giving away now.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:13.260]   We can watch a whole bunch of great HBO shows for free.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.260]   So that podcast launched this week, I think.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.180]   Anyway, we're going to get her on the radio show, I think.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.500]   iPhone, okay, we debated and I lost.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.300]   Who had iPhone SE?
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   Anybody?
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.300]   Did anybody have SE?
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   It's not out yet Leo.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.020]   I think I still make an iPhone mother of dragons.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.020]   I could still be right.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.420]   I was saying, I'm hoping they're just trolling us.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.060]   You were saying Laurie that it was going to be nine, right?
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.060]   As I remember.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.620]   Yeah, I have my hopes up so high that they wouldn't call it SE.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.820]   And I thought they would just cut the designation off and just call it iPhone.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.460]   But the rumor, now this is just a rumor still, right?
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   iPhone SE, red.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.940]   Just happy they're not calling it iPhone Home because that would just be so ET.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.180]   iPhone Home, I guess.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   It's got a home button.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.180]   I'm home.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.220]   Right to home.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.180]   So is this, where does this information come from?
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.180]   Is this another one of the.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.660]   I have a five Mac.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.460]   They had a reader tell them that it's the iPhone SE.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.100]   It's coming in white, black and red.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.100]   Product red.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.300]   50 gigabytes and that it's going to be released imminently as soon as last Friday, which unfortunately
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.380]   didn't happen.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.860]   But imminent could mean any time after that.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.860]   Should be right now.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   It's Tuesday, right?
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.860]   They do it on Tuesday.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.860]   Should be right now.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.860]   Should be right now.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.860]   Apple released it.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.860]   And there's drama Leo.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   There's drama.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.860]   What's the drama?
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.940]   The professor who's also been doing a lot of rumors lately said it was going to be the 15th,
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.260]   which is next week.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.500]   And so those are competing rumors.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.020]   So every day he's been asking quote unquote Siri if he's if he was wrong and then having
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.220]   the Craig Federighi, no sign.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.660]   So, drama Leo, got to get your popcorn.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.500]   Got to get your popcorn.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.700]   Should I throw out all of these?
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.740]   But when we do know it's going to be based on the A11 bionic that's in the iPhone A, we
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   know that right?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.740]   Or do we not hope?
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.260]   I mean, I was all guessing.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.380]   We know that it's going to be based on the iPhone 8 chassis, but the internals, like
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.780]   I want it to be based on the iPhone 11 really badly, but you never know when Apple's going
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.380]   to figure out that like put up that giant pivot table in their spreadsheet and say,
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.980]   actually the iPhone 10 R would be the better fit for the.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:23.220]   So it'll be the iPhone 8 body, but the A13, the iPhone 11 process.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.220]   It could be a 12 or a 30.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.620]   Like the only reason I say a 12 is because the new iPad Pro came out with an A12 still.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.380]   So I'm just like, but that's not just any 12.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.380]   That's the A12 bionic.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.420]   So this could be the A12 X.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   I'm losing Andy.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.420]   It's a easy.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.020]   It's both zid bionic.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.500]   Oh my God.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.180]   They're really, they're starting to slide into like Sony brand name like, well, I really
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.900]   love my new Sony a 55 L music player.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.740]   Like, you know, it's I am at the point where I really do.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.460]   I don't trust my memory for CPUs and on Apple anymore.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.780]   I really do have to check to see, okay, I do know the 12 is a higher number than this
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.820]   other number, but what what sub components and what other processes are in there and
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.820]   what does that echo mean?
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.740]   Well, it would have been nice if they could have gotten the chip cadence to match the
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   phone cadence.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.540]   So the iPhone 11 had the A11, but no, it didn't.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.060]   And the X means a couple more GPUs and the Z means one more GPU.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.100]   So like the roomers or the GPU since we're talking about the iPad, what about the rumor?
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.500]   And this is the old 2018 iPad.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.340]   As far as anybody can tell, that's the same processor.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:32.540]   And the rumor is that this just a bit switch was flipped to give it the extra lanes for
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   the GPU.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.420]   It's just binning like they got, they got better producing them.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.380]   Like when you make chips and Intel is famous for this, like an I three is really just like
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.460]   a, an I five that came out worse on the assembly line and they've been it that way.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.140]   And they even been based on performance now, depending on who's buying from them.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.460]   But like the original Apple, not the original original one based on Mac OS, but the other
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.460]   Apple TV was using CPUs that were only one of the cores were good.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.780]   So a bunch of CPUs came out.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.420]   They only had one core that was functional, couldn't put them in the phone.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.500]   So they put them in the Apple TV.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.220]   And when they ran out, they actually had to start fabricating those CPUs as only one
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   core.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.980]   So previously it would be way too expensive to get all those GPUs working.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.140]   So if any one of them failed, that was fine.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.460]   It was, you know, as long as they had, what was it, seven active cores, they could ship
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.460]   it.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.580]   Now those yields have gone up and it's economical for them to get, you know, the reliability
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.820]   and everything is there to get those eight cores.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.860]   So that chip just, it's a good marketing point to add to the chip now.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:37.740]   There also is, and apparently Groobers now confirming this, no U1 ultra wideband chip
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.500]   in the iPad.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   It's confirmed.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.500]   It's not.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.940]   Well, Groobers confirming it saying a little bird told me.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.180]   So it's still a rumor.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.900]   But he's saying his sources confirm the speculation.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.380]   I fix it, couldn't find it.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.100]   So that doesn't mean it's not there.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.300]   It wasn't in the FCC filing, maybe most telling.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.860]   It doesn't have that airdrop feature where you aim at the person that you want to airdrop
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   to.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.260]   That requires the U1 chip, I think, for positioning.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.260]   Would be surprising.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.700]   It's a 2013 feature that it requires something to be a routine chip to work, but it's hard
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.860]   to tell.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.860]   It would be surprising, especially if Apple is going to release these tags anytime soon,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.860]   because that's...
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.860]   Sorry.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.860]   So sorry.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.860]   It's going to be a cool feature, right?
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.660]   Or maybe Apple's going to position is going to be, oh, you can't aim an iPad.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.540]   After they just put in that fancy camera.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   It's just too big.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.340]   You can't aim at it.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.820]   But I lost it.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.460]   I want to find it.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.620]   So it's a little confusing.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.100]   I can lose an iPad.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.380]   And what's confusing to me is, and I hate this, is I don't know what's rumor, what's
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.340]   fact, what's confirmed.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.860]   Most of this is speculation.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.700]   Any unreleased product is definitely speculation.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.100]   But at least we know with the new iPad, which is out, and people have been able to tear
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.820]   it down and so forth, doesn't look like it has that U1 chip for reasons.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.100]   And it's not functional either way right now.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.420]   Oh, it is functional in the iPhone.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.620]   No, but it's not functional in the iPad.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.780]   Like you just said, you can't turn on the iPad.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   You can't do it.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.260]   Yeah, so regardless of what they are not, it's not turned on.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.580]   Yeah, we know you don't have it.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.380]   And they didn't mention it in the FCC filing, which I think they would have to.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.300]   Or in the briefings or in the website or anything like that.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.540]   So actually this is worth mentioning.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.700]   So it's the same processor in the new iPad, but it's one of the higher bin sorted versions
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.100]   that has the extra GPU, two extra GPU lanes.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.300]   And the biggest difference is the screen's the same, right?
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.940]   Physical hardware is the same.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.420]   The biggest difference is the camera.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.100]   It's got now that LiDAR and a two lens system instead of the single lens system.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.420]   Is it a better camera than the lens in the 2018 iPad?
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   Is it a better sensor?
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   It is.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.420]   It's closer.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.900]   It is not quite the iPhone 11, but it is closer to the iPhone 11.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.820]   I mean, I don't want to encourage people to take pictures with their iPads anyway.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.020]   You just look dopey.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.180]   Well, I mean, I know they're going to, I know they're going to.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.140]   Well, there are people on their main camera.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   Right.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.660]   Mostly people my age.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.900]   Well, also, also imagine, also imagine people.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.620]   I'm sorry, let me just back up and say, I remember the first time I saw someone taking
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.060]   pictures with a tablet in Boston.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.780]   I remember being in the public garden.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.340]   The first time I saw someone using a selfie stick, it was an Asian tourist thinking, Oh,
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   my God, that's so stupid.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   I can't.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.340]   It's so stupid.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.340]   But now it's everywhere.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.340]   No people are making a case for them.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.460]   But it's the iPad is a special case.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.100]   I think I do think that you're kind of weird for taking a picture with like an iPad mini
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.460]   or a Samsung tablet.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:43.140]   But when you say that as a way of capturing something and then not as taking a picture,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:49.540]   taking a capture that you can then edit a man use as a basis for other art or something
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.260]   that you're trying to assemble from the field.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.500]   The iPad Pro is one hell of a like remote content creation station.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.820]   And so it's kind of it's really, really cool to me that Apple is paying attention to how
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.300]   well those cameras perform.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:09.900]   If only they would pay attention to how well the built in webcams of their notebooks perform,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.220]   they would we would have something here.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.380]   So that's an interesting point.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.220]   There's new MacBook Air, which I think mine is coming Thursday.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.060]   But you guys, Renee, you had one, I think.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.060]   Yes.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.060]   I'm here.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.340]   It has a terrible eyesight, 720p eyesight camera, as always.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.780]   But somebody said that's because of the limitations of the thin lid.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.500]   To go on a stern, I think it's live.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.940]   You did a video comparing the terrible quality of most laptop.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   Right.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   But you're all bad.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   Especially in the age of home.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.100]   But now we're sheltered at home, Leo.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   We need good cameras.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   We want better cameras than our laptop.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.140]   And this is why June Stearns is one of the best people in the business.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.900]   She's the one who says, "Well, I have access to lots and lots of different laptops.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.260]   There's a simple way to settle this.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.700]   I'm just going to take lots and lots of…
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.180]   I'm going to drive myself insane by doing this.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.180]   She likes doing the hard work.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.780]   That's really good for my channel.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:07.460]   And so she very, very pointedly pointed out that Apple, as far as every single laptop,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:14.180]   they don't really put any… they don't make it as super impressive as your $200 standalone
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.380]   Logitech.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:27.380]   But nonetheless, even up compared to other laptops from other makers, Apple shows a rather
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.420]   heroic lack of interest in providing anything that's innovative or even competent.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.140]   You're still stuck with like 10 year old technology.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.420]   This is… I've been thinking this and saying this so many times over the past couple of
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:45.060]   months during this crisis that a crisis point doesn't create cracks so much as it
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.340]   causes existing cracks to widen.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.060]   And so all these things that Apple has been ignoring about its hardware line are now like,
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.620]   "Oh, people don't use their built in… people don't really use their built in eyesight
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   cameras anyway."
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.860]   Now everybody's using their built in eyesight cameras.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.260]   So now everybody has ego to one degree or another.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.500]   And when you are one of like four different live streams in a window and everybody sees
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.900]   I have felt this myself with Renee and Alex.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.300]   Wow, Renee's Renee's stream looks great.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.460]   Alex's stream looks great.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.740]   Damn, maybe I should switch from like these cheap LED panels to like a new LED panel that
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.820]   has remote control so I can adjust the lighting on the fly.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   So this is where people are going to start noticing that I can look better to my boss
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.860]   to my team if I have a better camera built in.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.620]   Why did I pay $2000 for a laptop with a crappy camera?
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.620]   I would take a camera bump.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.820]   I've said that in my last, I don't know, five years of MacBook reviews.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.780]   I would literally take… if they want to make the lids that then, fine, I will literally
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.180]   take a well crafted camera bump at this point just to have a 1080p in MacBook Air is in
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.740]   a 4K in MacBook Pro.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:57.820]   And also now it's really hard to get a Logitech camera so you can't even upgrade it.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.380]   Although I've been using… you can use obviously if you have the right cabling, you
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.260]   can use your iPhone as a camera.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.740]   That's going to be a better camera.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.740]   Although that's kind of what you're saying.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.740]   You should do continuity camera though.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.020]   They should… like if they're going to force you to have terrible, just make continuity
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.020]   camera.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.020]   What's continuity camera?
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.460]   So you turn on your iPhone and it works with your Mac.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.220]   Oh yeah, yeah, but just hands off.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   And you can just switch over.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   Yeah, because you have to cable it, right?
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.220]   You have to…
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.220]   Like sidecar for cameras.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.620]   And then I'm using a HDMI cable with my Sony.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   I can do that.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.380]   You have to have the right adapters.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.780]   Well, but you can.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.500]   I actually have a really nice setup now with that ATEM Mini.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.820]   And I have one of the Canon point and shoots and I'm going to put another Sony on that.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.780]   And I can also pick up one of my screen on it and I can do the show just like I'm doing
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.340]   it here from home.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.140]   But I'll tell you what I can't do.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   This.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   I love this.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.140]   The 4-box.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.100]   The Brady Bunch Effect.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.420]   Are we basing all of…
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   Hello, hello.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.420]   Hello, hello.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:14.340]   Are we basing all of our leaks on case vendors who shipped their cases early?
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   Is that all?
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   Well, no, there were…
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.340]   Go ahead, Laura.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   Go ahead, Laura.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:24.980]   There were those two incidents where on Apple's website, one of them was a case.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.980]   That's right.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.700]   But there was Apple Care where it was the… for the iPhone SE.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.420]   And it will make you feel better because wasn't there also a clip from an Apple website that
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.420]   mentioned the iPhone 9?
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.380]   I think I saw that.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.540]   There was Verizon.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.540]   It was Verizon.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   Verizon.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:51.140]   They have some deep in the mix wording where they reference iPhone 9.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.700]   But that's where things get a little bit…
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.700]   Are they…
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   Aren't they?
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.340]   My hope that it's not going to be an iPhone SE.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   That's my glimmer of hope is like, "Well, there's these other people that are calling
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.340]   it this."
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:10.540]   But really what it comes down to is if it's on Apple's website, it's more likely to
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.540]   be what Apple is saying.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:19.980]   But I think it was a bell-kin case that it said iPhone SE/8/8.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.420]   So that was the way it was worded out and the implication being that there's not going
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.940]   to be any change to the physical chassis of it at all.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.940]   Okay.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:36.220]   Well, we'll find out in a couple of minutes or next week or who the hell knows.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.820]   I'm going to put my bet on it right now.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.540]   I'm going to say we're going to find out about it on…
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.140]   Let's do a new bet.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.980]   April 14th or 15th?
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.300]   I'm going to say April 14th.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   Woah, Monday.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   Ooh.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   Going with the off-care beat.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.060]   No, no, no, that's on a Tuesday.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.060]   That's…
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.060]   Seven days from now.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.060]   Yeah, next Tuesday.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.060]   Yeah, next Tuesday.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.060]   Okay.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.060]   Care to make it interesting, L'Oreal.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.940]   I'll wait your 24 squares of toilet paper that is going to be get delayed.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.940]   I can offer you a…
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.940]   Two o'clock.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.940]   Two o'clock.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.340]   I can offer you 150 milliliters of sourdough starter.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.340]   Ooh.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.340]   My hands on a timer.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.340]   No!
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   I hope I'm right.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.740]   All right, you've got some bleach or disinfectant wipes to throw into this pot.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.940]   Look at these fine Clorox wipes.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.340]   Two portions.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.900]   This is like gold now.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.900]   These are like so precious.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.140]   They're better than Bitcoin.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.820]   I asked, I said, "Do we have any more of these?"
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   They said, "No, use them carefully."
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.820]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.820]   Yikes.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.820]   Yikes.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.660]   Apples rumored air tags.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.140]   Can I just add one thing to Lori's?
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:41.100]   I'm guessing it'll be the 15th, not the 14th, only because OnePlus has already staked out
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.300]   the 14th.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.500]   Not that I think Apple cares, because they've said before, Apple's like your rich cousin.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.220]   It just shows up and expects the guest room no matter who else is there or who else is
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   arriving.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.220]   Which cousin or the king?
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.220]   Right.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   No, but it just means that they'll…
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.500]   The Apple Vloggers will cover the iPhone and the Android Vloggers will cover 1 plus 8.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.100]   The OnePlus 8 looks great.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100]   So…
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.100]   Yeah, but they'll be…
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.700]   The general tech people will split their focus and I don't think Apple wants to give
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   up half the attention.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.260]   They'd much rather let you get that out of your system on the Tuesday and then just
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.860]   get the press cycle on Wednesday.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.340]   Here is a screenshot.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.340]   Oops.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.180]   I just ruined it.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:25.540]   Here is a screenshot from an Apple training video, I think, that says, "Enable offline…"
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.060]   This is Apple's…
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.060]   "Appelosophy."
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.380]   "Enable online finding."
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:40.580]   "Enables device and air tags to be found when not connected to Wi-Fi cellular."
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580]   So…
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.940]   And that was from an Apple training video.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   "Support video."
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.940]   Oopsie.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   Whoops.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.380]   Well, it's hard to keep the stuff secret forever.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   I mean, that's fine.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.340]   Especially when they were in the phone.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.060]   The assumption would be that they already thought this was going to be out at this point.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.060]   Ah, you're right.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.540]   So there's these little things going on in the background that were…
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.180]   You know, there's some software update that had air tags still in it because they expected
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.460]   to already put air tags out and then whoops, they didn't put it out.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.500]   Whoops, they forgot to take it out of the beta, you know, like that kind of thing.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.900]   But apparently it's gone now, so…
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.700]   So Microsoft just did a strange thing.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:27.220]   They announced no more in-person conferences for a year.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.220]   A year.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.100]   Like that soup guy on Seinfeld.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.100]   Not for you.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.620]   No confidence for you.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.940]   So Apple…
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:39.540]   So currently, WWC is not in person, obviously, but they're currently planning a stream.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.820]   Google has said they're not going to stream their own Google I/O developers conference.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.820]   Do we think…
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.820]   They're just not having it, right?
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.020]   Yeah, they just said we're not going to do it.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.020]   Can Apple not do a developer conference?
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.020]   No.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.220]   I think they can still do it.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:01.660]   I think Google I/O, the difference is that that's a very hands-on conference.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.940]   It's a very physical interaction.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:09.180]   It's a lot of like displaying and trying and things moving and doing stuff.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.620]   And you walk from tent to tent and things like that.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.180]   I think Apple can do it because I think that they can stream this stuff and you don't
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.660]   have to be quite as hands-on showing off all this new physical technology and stuff.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.820]   I'm pretty sure there's not going to be an issue for Apple to make that happen.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   So John Prosser…
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.540]   They're also better with technology.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:37.820]   John Prosser is saying that WWDC will be when Apple announced in June, by the way.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.820]   Oh, thanks.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.820]   All the things.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.820]   The Beats.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.820]   Let's see, $350.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.820]   What?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.100]   They're going to call them the AirPods Pro Lite.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.100]   Is that?
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.100]   No.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.940]   That's why the tools are going to be Studio Pods and the other ones are going to be AirPods
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.940]   X.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.940]   You can't use an X and a 10 and you're branding.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.420]   It is not fair to my brain.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.420]   I know.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.180]   Except for Apple already does that.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.620]   So the Apple over-ear headphones that we've been talking about, we've even seen images
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:09.620]   in Apple's own iOS resources.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.100]   Codename B515, $350.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.860]   These are comparable to the Beats 700.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:22.260]   And Prosser says, "aimed for WWDC and then AirPods…"
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.820]   What, 10?
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.540]   I'm going to say X.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   I'm going to guess X.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   No, it can't be X.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.100]   Well, because they were Beats X and it's supposed to be the same branding as Beats X.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   So…
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   Hyperventilating.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.100]   It's like the A10X.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.900]   They give an A10X and an iPhone 10.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   Okay.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   And the A10 is an X.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   The AirPods…
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.900]   I can never get it right.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.820]   X, $200 and for September, October.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   Oh, I see.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.780]   Digitimes was the one that said it was the AirPod Pro Lite or AirsPod Pro Lite.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.780]   Okay.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.340]   Well, it's like they called the iPhone plus the iPhone math.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.780]   Like that was a translation that came through.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.180]   Oh, this is bad translation.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180]   I get it.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.180]   Math.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.180]   iPhone math.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.180]   Really?
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.380]   That's pretty funny.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:10.540]   So there's a lot of talk about Amazon getting out of the Apple tax.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   Discuss.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:20.300]   A lot of content creators have got to be feeling really, really minused about now that they
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:26.540]   have to pay 30% because they don't have the sort of negotiating power that Netflix
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.700]   and other big creators have.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.940]   Apple has always had a sort of not well known sliding scale.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.140]   It's not as though they were taking 30% forever from everybody.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:40.340]   But the ability for Netflix to say that, no, you don't get…
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.580]   The ability for content creators to say that we can sell through the app store without
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:50.340]   necessarily always taking over a 30% cut, that's got to make a lot of the smaller creators
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.340]   feel minused.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.940]   And it's also got to make every single other content provider feel as though they got to
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.020]   go back to the table.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:05.340]   Like it still bumps me up that I generally buy my Wednesday digital comics on my Chromebook
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.900]   because I can go to the comicsology store and tap a button and say, "Yes, please buy
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.900]   this now."
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:15.660]   It's still a bummer that if I'm on my iPad, I have to swipe out, go into Safari, go into
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.220]   the website, then swipe back in.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.220]   And a lot of…
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.900]   It's not just the money that these companies are giving up that hurts.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:29.060]   It also hurts users that it's a very, very silly user experience.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:34.700]   And there's no analog between Apple tablets and other tablets to really compare with.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.380]   But it is definitely an issue when you're comparing an Android experience with an iPhone
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.380]   experience.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:46.020]   Again, I'm sure that Amazon really, really likes the fact that as soon as you've got
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.500]   somebody interested in buying this digital book, particularly when you tell them, "Oh,
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.780]   by the way, it's $2.99 all day today," you want them to push that button right then
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.020]   and there and not have to leave in order to go someplace.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:07.900]   So I hope this turns into Apple either rethinking its idea of a 30% cut for everybody or reveals
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.420]   that they've already been thinking about this.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.540]   I do acknowledge that if without the 30% cut, that's the money that not only that Apple
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:19.180]   takes as revenue, but it also supports all the activities that keeps not just the App Store,
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.420]   but the entire API system and the entire screening environment work.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.380]   But nonetheless, it is one hell of a cut to take.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.380]   So my thing is that I totally agree.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:34.180]   I think that 10 years ago when this started, people who were used to the box software business
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.220]   and their retailer took 55% or they had to pay all the website maintenance, they thought
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:43.220]   30% was a good deal and you can go back in time and see that, but times change and things
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.700]   evolve and this has stayed really, really static.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.780]   Digital goods, sorry, physical goods have never had this.
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.740]   When you buy something on Amazon, Apple doesn't get 30% of your DVD or your cereal box.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.340]   I mean, it's always been completely different.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:03.900]   The issue that they keep facing is that you can't have multiple middle person aggregators.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.660]   So a lot of these services aggregate other people's comics or other people's music or
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.300]   other people's videos.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.420]   They take like 30% of that and then try to sell them on the App Store, which is Apple
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:18.380]   aggregating everybody else's apps, taking 30% and then trying to sell them directly to
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:23.060]   customers and there's no 230% in there to work out.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.580]   So they have to either compromise and both take 15% or figure out some other kind of
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.780]   deal and the current one, booting people out and not letting them purchase at all is just
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.420]   hostile for customers.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.580]   That doesn't work for anybody.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:40.300]   It makes it worse for Apple, worse for the customer and worse for the middle person app
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   aggregator.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.780]   So I really agree with Andy, this has to get figured out.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.660]   And I think that it could be figured out in a way that's still sustainable for Apple.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:53.460]   The only issue I think Apple has right now is that they promised shareholders massive
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:59.460]   growth in services and the biggest services growth engine is the App Store and the biggest
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:05.140]   App Store growth engine is in app purchases primarily of these games and the minute Epic
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.260]   saw Amazon, they did everything that everyone thought they would do and say, "Hey, why can't
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.260]   we have that deal as well?"
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.580]   Yeah, because Tim Sweeney and Fortnite, they were immediately upset.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.620]   And in fact, they're the ones who said to Android, "We're not going to do it because
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620]   you don't have to on Android."
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.740]   And if you lose that candy crush money, then your App Store revenue goes down and then
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.740]   you're not meeting those.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.500]   But seriously, then you're not meeting those services goals you made.
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.340]   So I think in an ideal world, there's a much better deal for everybody.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.140]   I just wonder how much negotiations and how much setup it's going to take.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.860]   And what do you guys think Apple gave up to do this?
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.220]   I mean, that's a really good article on it.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.420]   And he said it was a win-win for everybody because Apple gets a percentage of Amazon
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.020]   before where they weren't getting any.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.380]   Amazon has the option to charge through their card system if you're already a customer,
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.900]   but they have the bigger access to the Apple pool if you're not a customer.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.700]   And the customers can actually buy something in the store, which is a huge convenience
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.260]   and usability win.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:08.940]   The two times Apple's done this previously without T-S and Canal 2, both of them were
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.220]   traditional cable companies.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.140]   And Apple got integration into the AirPlay app.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:21.180]   I'm looking at Ben Thompson's article because he's also debating, "Well, what are the ways
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.180]   to look at this?
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.180]   Did Apple win?
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   Did Amazon win?
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.140]   Did Apple quit pro quo?
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.460]   It's the first time Amazon is the first time an over-the-top service has gotten this kind
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.460]   of deal."
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.260]   Although Apple implies in its statement that, "Oh no, we do this with a lot of premium
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.340]   providers.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.940]   We'll name another one Apple because there's three."
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.940]   That's it.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.700]   And two of them are cable companies or existing TV distributors.
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.900]   This is the first one with an over-the-top.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:52.100]   So do you think Apple, what did Amazon give Apple to do?
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.980]   Obviously, Apple's not dumb enough.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.740]   Or was it a maybe in its--
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.500]   The in its purchases.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:02.420]   Is it the fact that the Supreme Court is reviewing the App Store case soon?
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.580]   Does it have anything to do with that?
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.580]   I'm sure that doesn't hurt, especially with this court, where they seem to zig when you
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.340]   think they're going to zag.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.540]   You said they're getting-- what are they getting in App purchases?
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.780]   They're getting some of the in App purchases, yeah, because if you can now buy things in
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   the app and if you don't have an Amazon card on file, it goes to the App to Apple's in
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   App purchase.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:24.260]   Instead of Amazon getting the inconvenience to having to go to the web and Apple getting
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.420]   nothing, they both get a share of that pie, which is a compromise I think that they are
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.460]   going to have to do with everybody.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:34.260]   And I think the wording says something about it.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.460]   You'll be charged by however your current subscription works.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.460]   So if you subscribe to--
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.100]   They're not losing everybody.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   Right.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:47.700]   And it also, it becomes a convenience thing for new subscribers to Amazon Prime that are
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.980]   going through their phone to do it.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.700]   Because now I can subscribe to Amazon Prime through the app on my phone, which means Apple
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.500]   gets 30% of that.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:01.820]   And then from now until the end of time, or until they change their contract, every time
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:08.780]   I rent or buy a movie on Amazon Prime, no matter where I buy it, that's now 30-- actually,
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:14.260]   I take that back, not anywhere, because I'm sure that if you buy it on Amazon, Apple doesn't
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.300]   get 30% of that, I think, maybe.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.700]   Definitely on your phone, then Apple will get 30% of that since it's already tied to the
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.140]   account that's already tied to Apple.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.300]   It's also Apple acknowledging that the world's changed.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.700]   I mean, they started putting Apple TV and TV sets.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.100]   They allowed Amazon Music on the HomePod, right?
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:42.620]   So Apple's been-- this has been an ongoing process of kind of relaxing a little bit.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.580]   But I'm just thinking that they didn't make enough money.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.900]   They didn't make up in the in-app purchases what they lost.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.260]   Or maybe they didn't lose anything.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.300]   What they lost was users being inconvenienced and having to go to the web to make their
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   first-use.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.620]   And I think YouTube still takes half.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.340]   I know for some of the newer features is 30%, but I think it's still half.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.900]   And I think Amazon on physical goods still takes a huge cut.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.300]   Yeah, you can just--
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   If you're evolving slowly--
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.100]   If you're an app in the App Store, you're getting benefit for that 30%.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.900]   And Apple can make a strong case, and I'm sure will in the Supreme Court.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.780]   No, we're giving them download storage, all sorts of marketing, all sorts of stuff.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:23.540]   But it's rent-seeking when you're doing it with something like Amazon-- I mean, with
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:30.260]   existing subscribers to Amazon Prime or Audible Books, that's just rent-seeking.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.900]   Because they're already subscribers.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:38.100]   You're not providing any service to Audible or Amazon to justify the search.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.420]   Why there could be language like if we convert to new subscriber for you.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.300]   This is what they do now at 30% and 15%.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.140]   But there could be something where-- because your subscriber just go ahead and do it.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.420]   And if it's new to you, they will charge in the first time.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.500]   And after that, you can migrate them if they sign up.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.660]   Yeah, that's fair.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.660]   Right?
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.620]   Because then it's like a brokerage fee.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.340]   Maybe that's all that happened, really, is just, you know, let's be reasonable here.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.620]   I'm sure, like Renee said, there's a lot of factors that went into this and added up
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.180]   to it just makes sense for them to do this at this time.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:13.220]   The EU is such a random gun at this point where they are very, very aggressive in going after
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.060]   monopolies in the tech industry in the way that the United States may never be or may
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.220]   not be for another couple of years.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:25.620]   So it helps to be able to make that case that we had rules that were in place to launch
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.580]   this service, but now we are making sure that we are creating equal opportunities for all
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.980]   comers.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.340]   And that would not be the one reason why they did this, but this is part of the math
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:42.820]   that went into, okay, it is time to not lose our relationship, lose our position, lose
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.740]   our reputation as the honey badger of contracting negotiations.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:49.540]   I imagine he didn't say the Wolverine at least.
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.900]   Can we take a minute?
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.220]   Wolverine has his charming, his is charming possibility.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   So.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:54:02.260]   We have to talk about that, but that Amazon Prime, that this new thing has just ruined
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:11.780]   Amazon Prime on Apple TV for me because on, so if you use a fire set top box of any kind,
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:17.300]   when you use Amazon, when you use Amazon Prime on that, it's intermingles Prime with
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.580]   not Prime.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.660]   And you're always, oh, look, this movie that I can watch, oh, I can't watch it on Prime.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.540]   It happens so often that it becomes very frustrating on Apple TV.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.460]   Nothing that you couldn't rent would just appear.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.900]   I mean, nothing that wasn't available in Prime would just appear.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.100]   You could eventually go down a rabbit hole of recommendations.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.100]   But now.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.100]   So now they're undifferentiated.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.100]   Everything's there.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.100]   Yes.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.500]   And it's driving, like, oh, look at this movie.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   Oh, I can't.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.740]   Yeah, that's why I tell people not to use a fire.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:52.460]   I tell people not to buy fire TV stuff because it's an ad for Amazon.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.940]   It really kind of promotes Amazon.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.940]   It's frustrating.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.180]   But you're saying that's going to be now on Apple.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.180]   It already is.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:02.420]   I was already frustrated the last couple of times I jumped into Prime video.
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.780]   I was like, OK, what am I going to watch this weekend?
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.660]   Like, oh, this movie got rented.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.700]   I have a little badge on the album art on the box art that says this is free.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:15.900]   On the TV app for me, I go to CBS All Access and I click on something.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.300]   But oh, no, in Canada, they've sold the rights of that to global.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.460]   And then it takes me to global.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.660]   And it says you have to sign in with your cable.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.060]   I'm like, I don't have cable, or I click it and I go to Amazon and then I click on
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.460]   it goes, oh, but this really requires a Stacks TV subscription.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.340]   We're just showing you that it's available.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.300]   There's a dark pattern.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.300]   That's a dark pattern.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.300]   Right?
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.380]   I think it's a dark pattern.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.340]   It's a trick to convince you to spend more money, basically.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.620]   And it's not it's user hostile.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.820]   It's not user friendly.
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.500]   My son came up with another really annoying thing.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:51.980]   He wants Logic Pro on his because he's quarantined and he loves doing it.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.340]   And I have purchased Logic Pro and it's in a family share.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.100]   But when he goes to the app store, it says buy.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.100]   And you have to go through the whole process before it says, oh, you don't have to buy
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.100]   it.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.100]   We are.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.940]   You already own it.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.140]   That has annoyed me for years.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.100]   I think that's a dark pattern too, isn't it?
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.580]   It lose track of you sometimes too.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:16.420]   Like I will once in a while, I'll end up buying the same movie twice on iTunes because
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.620]   they change something insignificant about it.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.420]   But most of the time I go through and it goes, oh, yes, sorry, we forgot that you already
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   didn't know.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.420]   They could fix that.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.500]   Is there a reason they don't fix that?
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.900]   Because that's really that's not good user.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.060]   I was wondering if it's assuming it's still Web objects.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.540]   Yeah, that's always the excuse.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   Damn Web objects.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:41.980]   Not the system world will not be right until the letters NS no longer appear at the front
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.580]   of every single system call in the API.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.380]   All right, let's take a little.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   I think we'd take a little break at this point.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.060]   Hey, I'm glad you guys are here.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.060]   It's fun to hang with you.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.060]   If you just.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.060]   I'm here too.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.060]   And I'm glad you're all here.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.060]   We're glad you're all here.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.060]   You're not coughing.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.060]   You're not in a coffee.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.060]   I'm feeling good.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.060]   You're feeling good.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.340]   I give you an oxygen level right now if you'd like to picture the.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.140]   Oh, you're using an oximeter.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.180]   Yeah, that was that was another one of those things from my change of thinking it a couple
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   of weeks ago.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:16.340]   Again, after reading the experiences of somebody who would gone through it, it was part of it
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.180]   was part of the thought of the.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.460]   The understanding was going to be that this is not going to be like the flu if I get it.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.660]   This is going to be like it will pass.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:31.140]   Most likely I will not need medical treatment no matter how scary these symptoms are that
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.140]   I will be able to ride through it.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:38.380]   And so if I have a pulse oximeter, I'm going to be able to even assuming that I'm like,
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   Oh God, my breathing is really, really hard.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.380]   I'm coughing a lot.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:45.980]   I wonder if this is the point which I really need to burden the burden the medical infrastructure
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.980]   by coming in.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.900]   I will have data saying, No, you're blood saturated.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.900]   You still got 98% blood blood saturation, which is the same as been every day for the
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.060]   past two weeks.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.540]   This is probably just part of what stinks about having this sickness.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.100]   So yeah, I did.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.100]   That's why I bought one.
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.820]   But again, can you still get them?
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.300]   You can still you can still find them.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.900]   There's you know, there's a high I've found that there's a hierarchy that the first place
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.860]   you go and this is going to be like forever.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.860]   Not just after this crisis.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.620]   Like the first place you go is Amazon because that but that's the first place things sell
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.620]   out.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.700]   Then you go on eBay where independent sellers are.
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:24.820]   And then oftentimes you have to go from eBay to Etsy because that is also independent sellers.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.020]   But it's like the third place everybody thinks to look like I did.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.380]   I did buy myself a couple of a couple of masks last week.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.820]   And I knew at that point, I knew I'm not even going to bother going anywhere but Etsy.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   And I was able to buy like two brand new really, really good cloth masks and get them like
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.140]   three days later.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.300]   But yeah, I think you have to think a little bit outside the box these days.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.620]   You can still I was surprised to find that I bought mine at my local drug store because
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.580]   it was the last one left and it was the bottle with Bluetooth and the really cool apps will
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.060]   cost next to 30 bucks.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.940]   But at that point, I was like, I checked my phone like, yeah, you can still get them.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.700]   But it's going to be a couple of weeks and go, okay, I'd rather solve this problem right
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:03.700]   now.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.900]   But yeah, if you look, you can still get them for like 40 bucks if you look around particular
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:08.900]   in eBay.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.740]   That's a good thing to probably to have, but you'd never use it again, right?
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.220]   Well, let's see.
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.220]   That was another thing too.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.940]   I bought a blood pressure reader blood pressure cuff that you'll use.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:21.940]   That's a good thing.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:26.500]   Well, I don't again, I've always had like I give blood regularly and I get my blood pressure
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.380]   taken and it's like abnormally normal.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:35.060]   Like as in like, wow, we need to give him the given your overall level of fitness Andy,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.780]   we're starting to suspect that you smuggled in someone else's arm is so normal.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.380]   But did we forget to take the sticker off the screen?
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:46.580]   I mean, why, why, why are you wearing that big overcoat and why do you have like a big
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.620]   huge human size hump on the back of it?
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.180]   But that was, that was another sort of the same thing where there are times where you
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.220]   feel a little lightheaded or you feel a little tired.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.340]   You don't know why it is very, very easy to say, well, I'm going to put, I'm not going
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.460]   to self diagnose, but at least I want to see, okay, well, if I, if my blood pressure were
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.100]   really, really low, that would be a problem.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.060]   If my blood pressure were really, really high, that would be a problem.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.260]   At least I know that my blood pressure is normal, like you have a digital thermometer because
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.300]   you can say, okay, I'm not running a fever or if you are feeling sick, it's only a two
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.140]   point, it's only a one and a half point fever and hasn't gone up since the last time.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.060]   I really think that there are all kinds of things that we could be writing and talking
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:27.460]   about, about how a lot of things are going to change after this have nothing to do with
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460]   calamity.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.260]   It's going to be the realization that if you have rest the, this is only a talk about
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:39.140]   last week on NPR, by the way, that whereas we grew up and our parents and our grandparents
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.580]   grew up knowing that somewhere in the bathroom, you have a first aid kit that has bandaids,
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:48.140]   as disinfectant, it might have, it might have like a set of tweezers, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.220]   I think that part, what's going to come out of this is knowing that you also have that
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.140]   box of like digital over the counter diagnostic stuff.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.500]   So not necessarily so you can diagnose yourself so that maybe the medical system, a couple
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.900]   years in the future will be optimized towards you, call your provider and they say, okay,
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.300]   we'll have your records here that you do have a pulse oximeter, give me a reading right
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   now.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.140]   Okay, what's your blood pressure saying, okay, we really would like you to come in because
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.940]   that's not normal, stuff like that.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.220]   And hopefully all that will be in a watch someday that I can't use because I have an
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.220]   Android device.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:26.980]   Yeah, it's part of the new, the new first aid kit, a blood oximeter.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:27.980]   That's good for exercise too.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.260]   All right, that was the PSA portion of our show, the public service announcement.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.220]   And now a word from our sponsor.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.940]   We use no tax deduction.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940]   Yay.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.660]   I didn't know we were a public benefit corporation.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.140]   When did that happen?
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.420]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper cruder.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.220]   Zipper cruder is the place to go.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.420]   Actually, I want to give you a message.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   They've sent along to us.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.500]   They wanted to pass along to you.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.100]   We are big fans.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.140]   As you know, always have been a Zipper cruder.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:00.140]   We've done a lot of hiring.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   A lot of our staff came through Zipper cruder.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.780]   They wanted you to know that this is a time not to be overwhelmed.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:09.860]   We have to work to keep our loved ones safe and protect our communities.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.020]   We have to work to stay strong and stay connected, to stay focused.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.260]   Not easy.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.500]   We have to work to inspire, to innovate, to build new solutions.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.340]   But for all of this, we have to work.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.020]   We have to work together.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:25.100]   At Zipper cruder, we connect employers and people every day.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.340]   But today is different.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.820]   We are partnering with first responders, government officials, the medical community,
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:37.100]   the innovators, and the manufacturing, transportation, and food distribution industries.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:41.180]   We want to make sure that we are finding the right people for the right jobs, the jobs
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.940]   we need right now.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:48.380]   So normally we do a Zipper cruder commercial here, but they wanted me to tell you that.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.700]   And I don't want to just say thank you, Zipper cruder.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   Let's work together.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.940]   They are awesome.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:59.140]   And it's a special URL, zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   Zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.900]   There are a lot of jobs that need to be filled right now in this difficult time in Zipper
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.060]   cruder is there to help.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.500]   zippercruder.com/worktogether.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.020]   Thank you.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.660]   Thank you, Zipper cruder.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.660]   That's just really great, really great stuff.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:24.260]   All right, Andy Inako, Renee Ritchie, Lori Gill.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260]   They're all healthy.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.260]   They're all feeling good.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.580]   Andy's blood oxygen level is high.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.140]   Actually, I've been stealing oxygen from local kids.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.140]   So, 103%.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.140]   It's an octal.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.140]   Hold your breath.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:42.540]   I also have my eye on some Dalmatian puppies that I've seen.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.140]   A lot of rules would be considered.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.340]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.340]   That's right.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.340]   That's oxygen wherever you can.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.340]   I'm going to get y'all this.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:59.180]   Mark German's story, Google has acquired a Dublin-based AI startup called, is it Voices?
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.540]   Voices probably is, right?
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.540]   V-O-Y-S-I-S.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.900]   It's not like 19 letters because it's in proper Irish.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900]   Voices.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.980]   It's to better understand natural language, something Apple probably could get a little
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:10.980]   hand with.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.300]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.260]   Anything to say about that, you guys?
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.260]   They got a VR one too, right?
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.260]   The room right now.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.380]   Yeah, the money's good right now.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:27.940]   Next VR, this is interesting.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:34.260]   They're a live event streaming, augmented reality, virtual reality company.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:40.580]   The Apple concerts, like right now, Apple concerts, Apple theater, everyone will watch
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.820]   their Disney movies.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.460]   I can throw popcorn at Laurie in VR space.
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.460]   It would be wonderful.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.460]   It kind of makes sense.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:52.580]   I mean, if we were talking, I should have put this with the story about WWDC, but wouldn't
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:57.020]   it be interesting if you had a kind of a VR-enabled WWDC?
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:04.060]   You could go to the event and be there without really being there.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.220]   Probably not for something like WWDC.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.340]   You kind of want that for entertainment.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.580]   WWDC is, you're there for a purpose and you need to get stuff done, and that's not the
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.900]   time to be experimenting with a brand new former communication.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.300]   Or making everybody buy a visor.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.300]   That's true.
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:25.940]   Well, yeah, also, as wonderful as the possibilities of VR and AR, it's another opportunity to
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.940]   create another digital divide.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:34.580]   We're already facing problems where even if you have lower income households that have
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.100]   broadband, even if that broadband is decent, in many of those households, there's only
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.660]   one device that can really stream stuff.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:46.300]   And so that really means that there's a problem for parents who have to work via stream and
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.300]   kids who have to learn via stream.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:54.820]   So that's why I love these demos, but I think that we all always need to be very, very aware
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.780]   of the very legitimate complaint that a lot of what Silicon Valley does is solving problems
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.940]   that digital engineers who make $400,000 a year might have.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.820]   Let's see what else.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:11.220]   People slashes HomePod employee discount.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.660]   A lovely story from I'm more.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.660]   You guys speculate.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.980]   What a great website.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.140]   I love that website.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.180]   I love the, maybe has a word slash it if that's not the daily news.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.180]   That's great.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.300]   50% is not uncommon for employees.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:33.100]   And your author, Stephen Warwick, speculates it could be a sign of a, maybe they're dumping
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.860]   the HomePod for a new release.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.020]   What do you think, Lauren?
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:42.660]   Well, I mean, they're either helping people who had pay cuts from Apple.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.740]   Yeah, or have to be at home and want to listen more or whatever it is.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   It's too.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.740]   Didn't they?
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:49.740]   I think they slashed beach prices as well.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:55.700]   Oh, so maybe that makes, maybe it is really just being kind to employees or stuck at home.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.740]   And they want to listen to, no, they're like, if you're listening to your family, you're
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.740]   not working.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.420]   I got to give you all the audio.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   True.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.100]   It could be though, like, you know, what, how do you get rid of a lot of stock when you're
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.620]   about to put something new and you drop some, put some on clearance?
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.420]   Hope it clears out the shelves.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.980]   So it's, it's totally possible.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   Just don't know.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.740]   We don't know as often the case with Apple.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:22.700]   They're a black box, a mysterious organism.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:29.260]   They did pay a pretty hefty $75,000 bug bounty to a hacker who discovered a zero day camera
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.260]   flaw in Safari.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.260]   Ooh.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.580]   It's great to see that this kind of, that the bug bounty is working.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.580]   Yeah, for a while, Apple wouldn't do it.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.940]   They thought we're just going to drive the price up, but the price was already driven
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:46.260]   up by rogue states and, and our own companies that service them.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.420]   And so I think it was wise of Apple to say, no, you know what?
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.420]   Yes, we get paid for these.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:57.700]   It's particularly timely because we've seen intelligence agencies and security experts
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:03.820]   have been noting a serious uptake, like up to 100% in penetration attempts on companies
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.620]   like Apple on government things.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:10.820]   Their NASA, I think, was reporting a 200% surge in phishing video, phishing emails that
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   were coming up.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.780]   So yeah, this is, this is a good time to be to thank yourself for having thought ahead
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.820]   about ways that you can plug security holes proactively.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:31.300]   I guess there's a new book, Always Day One by Alex Cantor, which's on how the tech giants
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.340]   scrambled to stay on top.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:41.340]   And he's a BuzzFeed reporter and there's an excerpt from it about Apple's information
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.060]   systems and technology group.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.820]   They build their internal technology tools.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:51.460]   Actually, I suspect, I mean, a lot of them come by our studios are used to come by our
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.460]   studios.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.660]   Exactly our kind of nerds.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.820]   There are nerds, man.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.260]   We love you guys.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.100]   It's a Cold War every day, they say.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.700]   It's a huge contractor org that handles a crazy amount of infrastructure for the company.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.500]   The whole organization is a game of Thrones nightmare, said one ex-employee who worked
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.140]   at ISNT.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:17.020]   There's a Cold War going on every single day, said a former ISNT contractor, a different
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.740]   one, Archana Sabapathy, who did two stints in the division.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:26.540]   Sabapathy's first stint at ISNT lasted more than three years, second only a day.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:31.100]   Inside the division, she said, "Contracting companies such as Weepro, Infosys, and Accenture
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.300]   are constantly fighting to fill roles and win projects."
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300]   That sounds very Apple.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.540]   Like you guys bid against each other and we'll go with the one, the Darwinian winner.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.540]   Interesting.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.820]   I don't know anything about this.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.500]   In fact, I never really even thought about it, but of course it makes sense.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.260]   They've got a big infrastructure division.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.260]   I didn't realize this.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.740]   I didn't realize this was a big center in my former job because we had part of the systems
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.780]   that they were integrating.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.500]   I have a low-found respect for systems integration.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.660]   I'm sure some of them are wonderful, but a lot of them were just like, "What will instantly
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:03.980]   get us the sale while we're on our booze cruise?"
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.980]   Right.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:08.100]   A lot of people using Zoom these days, and of course you've read all the stories I'm sure
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:14.940]   by now about how insecure and unprivate Zoom is.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:19.820]   I've been telling people if it's a smaller group, 32 or fewer, use FaceTime.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   Right?
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.820]   If they're all iOS.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Yeah, or if they're all Apple, yeah.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   It'd be all iOS.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.900]   So the thing that I found, and I asked a bunch of people about this, and we talked about
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:33.220]   this earlier because I spoke about this on the, Leo and I did a podcast with Mike Asarzyn
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]   and Dan Moore, and we were in press.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220]   Talk about this.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.220]   Yeah, that was fun.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.220]   Yeah, clockwise.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.660]   My thing is that I will be grudging.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.780]   I will not use Facebook and I will not use Zoom, but if my family reaches out through Zoom
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.220]   or through Facebook, I will not ignore them, especially not with what's going on now.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:54.380]   But I feel like instead of using Zoom, whatever your group is, if you're all on WhatsApp,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.940]   if you're all on FaceTime, if you're all on Google Hang, whatever your social group
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.900]   already uses, it most likely has a video chat.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.980]   And rather than switching to Zoom, and I'm not saying that they don't have issues.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:12.380]   FaceTime has bugs and all of the various FaceTime products have their own set of moral quandaries.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.940]   But you can use what you have with your group.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.740]   You don't have to add new and potentially bother some technologies to your matrix.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:26.340]   Yeah, I'm going to be the opposite of Renee on this and talk about the everyday people.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.380]   And I talk to my friends about it too, because they all use Zoom now.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.820]   And they don't care.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.900]   It's not a big deal.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.500]   And there's this sort of sense of, I've already sold my soul to the devil.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:44.180]   So why not use the conveniences that the devil has provided me?
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:50.660]   And so I also want to say, don't worry too much about it.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.020]   Zoom is having some privacy and security issues.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.780]   And yes, they sold your data to Facebook.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.900]   But Google's been doing stuff like that all along, and you use Google Maps.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.340]   So don't stress out too much about it.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:08.260]   It's really like the thing about privacy and security and encrypted videos and things
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.260]   like that.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   And so I think that's why I think that people are about businesses and companies, but families
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.780]   and friends, they're not worried about that.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.780]   They don't care.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.420]   They just want to meet with their friends and have it be really convenient and easy to use.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:25.180]   They want to have a big group in a room and not have to worry about paying extra for it.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:31.260]   So that, I feel like it's important to step outside of our tech bubble and remember what
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:37.500]   our moms and our best friends and people who don't use technology aren't so as ingrained
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.700]   in technology, what they think and how they feel.
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.100]   And we don't want to scare them.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.500]   We want them to continue to have those social interactions with people without having to
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:52.020]   -- oh, I guess we can't use Zoom now because somebody read a story on the internet about
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.020]   it.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.020]   Or worse, they're scared while they use it.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.380]   And Zoom is so easy.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:05.020]   I set up, and it was a very easy thing to do, Jitsi, which is an open source, free conferencing
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.580]   solution.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.220]   You can go through their own by 8 by 8, which is an open source project.
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:16.740]   But you can also download, and I did, I downloaded and installed the server software for it.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.220]   You can join me if you want.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.380]   Twit.team/macbreakweekly.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.540]   I just put up a little room here.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.540]   And it's fine.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540]   It's easy.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:28.900]   It doesn't require any software installation because it's a WebRTC.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.380]   So it's just a link.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.580]   If you literally, if you typed in your browser, twit.team/macbreakweekly.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.020]   I'm sure people will do that in a moment.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.140]   You'd be in the conference immediately.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.220]   So it's very easy to use.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.340]   You can put the other somebody.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.620]   You can password protect it if you want.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.860]   Oh, you think we're going to get Zoom bombed now?
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   I don't know.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.220]   I trust our fine Mac break weekly on you.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   So many butts.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:57.380]   Anyway, I just -- what is that appended?
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.780]   I do think that it is easy to set up an alternative.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.380]   But I completely agree with you, Laurie.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.460]   People are just going to use the default.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.660]   I tried to get my family to use this.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.020]   And the kids were fine.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.180]   But my ex-wife was struggling so much.
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.180]   She said, "Can we just use Zoom?"
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.180]   It's like trying to move into the Zoom.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.180]   And we used Zoom.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.180]   Please get off Messenger.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180]   Can we move you to Signal?
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.180]   And they're like, "No, go away."
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.180]   Yes, exactly.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:21.180]   Why don't I ever get birth to you?
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.180]   Exactly.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.780]   So we are now getting -- I probably shouldn't put this up on the screen.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:25.780]   I'm probably taking this.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.340]   Don't install a PGP on your email.
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.340]   No.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   Get away from me, kid.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.900]   This is an interesting challenge to see how many people we can get in here.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.340]   None of them have turned their cameras on.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.100]   So I guess we're safe right now.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.580]   They're all still in their pajamas right now.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.580]   It's growing fast.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:44.980]   What's funny is this is just running out of a box in my home office that was my Minecraft
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.980]   server.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.980]   It was already running Minecraft.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   Hello, everybody.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.780]   Maybe it's the Naked Mac group watchers, like Naked Mac Break Watchers group.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.940]   And they just decided to all come in for the chat.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:58.180]   Are you guys -- nobody's turned on -- I have the mics off, but nobody's turned on the cameras.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.980]   Maybe they just don't want to be seen.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:04.260]   Because there's already 20 people, 21 people in there.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.220]   It's a good group.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.420]   There must be something going on.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.180]   If that many people are in there and none of them have that camera.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.020]   I might have it set up in a private -- some sort of private -- private way.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.740]   There's going to be a couple people who want to be seen.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.740]   So there's got to be some other --
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.740]   Just for us.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740]   Interesting.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.620]   Yeah, we -- actually, this is a good stress test because I have no idea how many people
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.380]   I can get in there at once.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.940]   I'm going to use that as my backdrop.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:36.220]   It's growing to make a big blow up of that so that it's growing fast.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.940]   Throw people the double blow up.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:41.100]   But the thumbnails, Andy, it's for the thumbnail.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.460]   Well, and that's another reason everybody wants to use Zoom because they all have those -- they
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   can use Zoom backgrounds.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.860]   And I don't think you can do that with Jitsi.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.740]   You'd have to get a green screen and some switcher and stuff like that.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.460]   There was a hilarious one where the guy got up, walked away.
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   Like there was two -- he was sitting at the desk.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   Oh, yeah, he saw that.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460]   He was also on the sofa.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.540]   He was off the desk and walked through the door and then got off the sofa and came to
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.020]   the desk saying this way nobody could ever tell if he was paying attention or not.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.980]   Siva Vaajanathan has been posting some fun ones.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   He's a professor, I think, of journalism at NYU.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:14.060]   See, or no, he's in Washington, isn't he?
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.060]   He posted one.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:19.380]   You know the meme where the guy's walking with his girlfriend, but he's looking over
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:25.020]   his shoulder at the other woman who's walking the other way going, whoa.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.860]   So he put his -- let's see.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.460]   Where did he put his head?
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:33.300]   I think his head is on the girl going that way.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.340]   So it looks like -- anyway, it's very funny.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.180]   He's tweeting a few fun backgrounds.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.820]   People are having a lot of fun.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.420]   So I don't -- I guess I must have turned on the --
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.220]   You want to know.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:46.220]   Stranger danger setting.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.620]   Stranger danger setting, yeah, because Carson's saying his camera's on.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.540]   And you guys can see me, right?
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.660]   So yeah, I must be -- that's good.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.020]   I'm not unhappy about that.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.220]   You're the only one that matters.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.220]   I'm the only one that matters.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.860]   I get focused on the star, on the talent.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.460]   There's a little guy in the corner there.
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.460]   He's focused on him.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.420]   I'll have to look in the settings.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.100]   Maybe I've done something to prevent it.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.620]   At least it's handling all of that.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.820]   If I turn on the mic, let me see what it sounds like.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.540]   Are you all in there?
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.540]   Hello?
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.060]   Yeah, they're muted or something.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:24.540]   I must have it, because I put some security on it so that it wouldn't go crazy.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.540]   No, Leo.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.700]   I think you know why they're not talking to you.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.140]   It's a good old-fashioned shooting.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.540]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   They're muted.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   I don't know.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.940]   Maybe it's something I did wrong.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.380]   If only Lori, Andy, and I were courted enough to switch our screen.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.780]   So the same thing at the same time.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.540]   Only we had that on the phone.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:49.100]   It's fun to play with all this stuff anyway.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.380]   Apple has -- there was a leaked memo that Apple sent out that said, "We're going to
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.860]   keep the stores closed until early May."
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.820]   At this point, here we are April 7th.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   That even seems a little over-optimistic.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.580]   But I don't know.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:08.300]   Now, any rumors that they might have been thinking about, "Let's open some key stores
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.380]   just for service."
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:15.500]   Now that every single state, but what five are now have the governors now basically saying,
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.660]   "No, you're not opening any stores.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:17.660]   They're not critical."
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.780]   And now that other stores that have been claiming to be critical because they want to
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.140]   stay open are being slapped down and forced to close.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:27.300]   I think that we are now -- I think a lot of different people, individuals and organizations
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.460]   are trying to understand this is going to be a long-haul sort of thing that we're going
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.380]   to get out of it.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:37.620]   But you cannot make any plans for anything in the next two or three months because everything
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:42.220]   as numbers continue to come in and models continue to change, we're not going to know
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.180]   when we can open the doors again.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.660]   And when, finally, the reason why we're not going out to eat is not because the restaurants
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:52.300]   are all closed, but because you can't get a reservation at McDonald's for the next five
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.300]   months.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:01.780]   Leonardo DiCaprio is joined with Steve Jobs with Elorin Powell Jobs to create a fundraiser
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:07.460]   on GoFundMe to raise money for the hungry during this crisis.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.860]   It's called America's Food Fund.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:16.340]   And 13.3 million raised out of a goal of $15 million.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:23.820]   I'm not sure how much DiCaprio and Jobs kicked in, but I imagine it was a fairly good chunk
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.820]   of change.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   So that's really great.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:30.020]   They're working with World Central Kitchen and Feeding America.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.900]   And boy, they've raised a ton of money.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.460]   Getting up there, yeah, that's amazing.
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:38.700]   Yeah, World Central Kitchen is Jose Andres' wonderful group that they feed so many people
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.580]   during crises like this.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.260]   Tim Cook also apparently kicking in some money there.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.380]   I complain on Twitter, but luckily there are heroes that I can just throw money at and
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.380]   make it a tough time.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:50.620]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.700]   They're making a difference.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   That's right.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:20:00.860]   Apple has doubled its China donation in the fight against COVID-19.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.620]   The initial, let's see what the, what's the amount?
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.180]   Do you know Lori off the top of your head?
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.540]   Is it 90, 90 million masks?
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.540]   Wow.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.540]   Wow.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.540]   That's great.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:11.540]   Are they making them?
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.540]   It's funny because most of these pests, I think, are a lot of them are made in China,
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.060]   right?
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.180]   Yeah, I think that's confusing.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:23.300]   So I know that there was an initial push where it was like literally they had some masks and
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.740]   storage and they sent them out.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:25.740]   Right.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.860]   But I think at this point now they're just, they're actually just dumping money into whatever
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.460]   factories can make them.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.700]   I think that's where we're at now with it.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:34.700]   It's also cash.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.060]   They have donated $7 million as well.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:44.740]   So of course Apple is, you know, has definitely have it has its feet in China.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   And it's important.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:51.060]   So he posted, Tim Cook posted this on Wednesday on YBO.
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:56.300]   And they had, and they've also opened all the Apple stores in China, 42 stores open.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.300]   The only country where Apple stores are, are opened.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.300]   It would be amazing.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:04.180]   This makes me think about it.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.180]   Go ahead.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:09.460]   Oh, I was just going to say it would be amazing if he did the exact same videos, but like
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.740]   in perfect matter, it came on and he went, you'll, we'll show Tim close.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.940]   And it just like totally did the Wable version exactly like it was so awesome.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.460]   And didn't, didn't the Zuckerberg do that?
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.100]   I think Mark Zuckerberg did a whole speech in China.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.100]   I don't know.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.100]   I don't know.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.100]   Apple marketing people speak Mandarin.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.100]   Sure.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.540]   Like they should get in there.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.340]   I am really excited about this.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.860]   And I saved the best for last.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:39.660]   I'm talking avocado.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:45.220]   This is something that has been always bothered me about the iOS springboard.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.140]   It's called the front interface.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.380]   I really love the widgets on Android.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.300]   Admittedly, you can make your phone look horrible and I understand why Apple doesn't
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   enable them.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:59.580]   But according to a leaked iOS 14 screenshot, beta code releasing is leaking.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:06.100]   Everything is leaking that there will be home screen widgets in iOS 14.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.100]   Is that credible?
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.100]   Interesting to me.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.820]   Well, I mean, like, so these are internal builds.
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:12.980]   I think this was a build from December that bloggers are joking.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:14.700]   Every single one of them has now.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:19.180]   And that means a lot of stuff isn't turned off the way it would be on an external distribution.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:22.740]   So it might have a bunch of stuff in there that's being built up and tested.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.580]   But the thing to me that's interesting is that HTC many years ago says, yeah, we put
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.580]   widgets on the home screen so I think it looks cool.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:33.260]   But almost nobody uses them and almost, almost nobody ever changes them from the default ones.
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.260]   So we're not actually sure they're great or not.
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.660]   But if they're not there, so many people complain about it.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:43.300]   And what I really want to know is not when they launch these, because I'm sure the iOS
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.980]   home screen, I don't think this is the refresh it needs.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.860]   But boy, does it need a refresh.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.020]   But when this launches a year later, I would love to see that.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:54.380]   And again, maybe Apple could do widgets like nobody has ever seen before.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.940]   I'll leave an outside chance.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.580]   But I just want to see the user statistics a year later and see it for any different
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:04.100]   than a lot of not the nerdy, nerdy Android users, but just the vast majority of Android
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.820]   users who think it looks pretty but never touch the stuff.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:13.660]   >> I'm well, speaking as an Android user, it's not that I want screens full of widgets,
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:19.300]   but my home screen, I want the full like full with screen weather app that will tell me
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:24.100]   as soon as every time I wake it up, essentially, I can have sort of a touchstone to the day.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.940]   There are times when I'm traveling, when I will create a screen of widgets so that I
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:32.460]   have a status board of here's where I need to go, here's my next meeting, here's this,
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:35.060]   here's that, here's my boarding pass for whatever.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:40.540]   I think it's more like people who use them, use the heck out of them, and people who don't
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.540]   have to be intimidated that they exist.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:47.580]   Apple is though in an interesting perspective, excuse me, interesting position as they usually
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:52.540]   are, where I think one of the problems with widgets is that all other companies, they
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:57.540]   create them, they create APIs for them, they create documentation for them, but then it's
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:01.420]   kind of up to developers to decide that it makes sense to add widgets support for their
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.420]   app.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:07.820]   When Apple decides that this is a really important thing, they are going to create, they create
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.540]   an internal budget for marketing the concept of widgets to developers, and so it's more
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:17.540]   likely they're actually going to promote them and actually going to support them, particularly
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:22.900]   in this case, as they continue to chip away at all the limitations of the iPad that make
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:30.900]   it not quite so good, a thousand dollar computer as a $600 Windows notebook can be.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:36.700]   The ability to have a, if people don't necessarily have the ability to have multiple Windows
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:42.140]   and multiple apps on at the same time, maybe all they really want is to have widgets sharing
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.980]   the screen, sharing screen space with applications so that they can keep an eye on things or keep
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.620]   a chat going, stuff like that.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:55.660]   So I'm very, very keen to see how this would change the, change the atmosphere inside iOS
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.020]   both for the phone, for the iPad.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.900]   What if they were complications and had all of that stuff built into it?
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.340]   People use a lot of complications.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:05.580]   They actually talked about it being maybe a little bit like the watch.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   I would, that would be great.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.660]   I want like just a line of text around the border of the screen, just like like ants walking
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.980]   around that I would actually use that a lot.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:20.540]   If I could inset my screen by like 32 pixels and just be able to toss complications into
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.420]   the side of it, just like in order to the corners of the screen like it can on the Apple
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.900]   watch, that would be very interesting.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.220]   I don't think it would stink at all.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.180]   Yeah, well, I mean, if you're going to do it, do it something different than Android,
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.180]   right?
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.180]   Don't just duplicate Android.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:38.460]   And the one thing that I've, I've come to terms with over this, after having an iPhone
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:43.100]   for so long, I never, ever, ever look for an app icon anymore.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.660]   I pull down and I do a search or I know exactly where it is.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:50.860]   So a page full of apps, nobody needs it anymore.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:54.220]   So let's get a new, a new way to, to find our stuff.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.220]   Yes, I agree.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.220]   That's better organized.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.420]   That's more efficient for us.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:06.340]   What the 720p webcam is to Apple notebooks, the iPad screen launcher is to apps.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.180]   It's like time to fix it.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.580]   Again, again, you're real happy with it.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:15.020]   When you created it 10 years ago, we would have liked you to see you make changes to it
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.460]   over the past 10 years because we think that there's some movement in that category that
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.540]   you could take it to.
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.540]   Right.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.780]   What I would love to see is make it editable and give me zone.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.920]   So if I want, I could have the constant search bar there because I like that on Android.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.380]   If I want, I can have a layer of complications because those are really useful on the watch.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:35.420]   I could have a stripe of Siri suggested apps because a lot of times I pull down search.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.420]   I don't have to search because the app I want is based on time of day, previous behavior,
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.420]   other apps.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:45.740]   Like, Siri don't talk so good, but Siri really seems to know the kind of apps that I want.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.120]   So put that there and then let me have a doc of like a double height doc or something
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.140]   of the apps that I just always want.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.380]   The minute I go like the messenger or whatever I always want when I go to my phone.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.100]   And then I'll start to be really, really happy and then I can drag and drop them to exactly
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.100]   where I want them.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.540]   Renee, I think you've just come up with the next column for.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:06.940]   Yeah, I think, yeah, you just made me think of something that's that you put something
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:12.660]   in such a great way that I think Siri, they should have called Siri Fido because you can,
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.660]   you can talk to it.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.660]   It might understand you.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.820]   It might respond back to you.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.900]   It might give you something interesting, but what it really does, what well is like jump
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.980]   into your lap when you need a hug or like bring your slippers when it knows it's time
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.140]   it was time to have your slippers.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:30.420]   That's I think Siri's big, big use case for now.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:37.100]   Tim Cook will be Ohio State's commencement speaker in a virtual ceremony to be broadcast
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.020]   online May 3rd.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.020]   That's cool.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.020]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   That's a big university.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:47.260]   There's going to be a lot of people in that commencement.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:54.060]   Yeah, and my heart goes out to everybody who doesn't get to walk traditionally.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.500]   Yeah, that's sad.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:01.100]   You spend your whole four years and really your whole life building up to this point and you
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.180]   can't get that moment.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:08.780]   But to have Tim Cook be your commencement speaker, I think there's some cool, cool.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.580]   I hope he wears a cap and gown and does that.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   I'm sure he will.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.220]   Might have got to dress up, right?
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:19.460]   He won't just sit in front of his fancy bookshelf and lean into his screen.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.660]   I'm sure he'll do something nice for it.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.820]   Apple's been a longtime partner with Ohio State.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:31.140]   65,000 iPads deployed to students over a five-year span and there's an iOS laboratory.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.340]   They're all in on iOS, which is kind of interesting for a university.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:38.100]   It's also an interesting opportunity.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.260]   Knowing what I think we have we've we've have seen what Tim has done with other commencement
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.740]   addresses and things like that.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.700]   He's not going to make it into like an Apple press conference or an Apple keynote address.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.420]   But it's an opportunity.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:54.500]   CEOs rarely get an opportunity like this where they are expected to.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.500]   It's very appropriate to talk about how they think and what their philosophies are and
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.980]   what their mood is at any given time of the year or any particular year in the decade.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.740]   And so I'm sure they will keep it focused on the graduate on the graduates.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:10.940]   I'm sure they're he's going to have that incredibly intimidating job for anybody, even a CEO,
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:17.060]   to what do you say to a bunch of 22-year-olds who are about to be unleashed into uncertain
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.060]   times.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:23.380]   It was true in the in the 80s and 90s when I was graduating high school in college and
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.540]   it's so much more true today.
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:29.740]   But it's going to be interesting to hear him speak from the heart and basically create
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:35.580]   and affect a live journal blog post.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:40.300]   Let us wrap up this adventure because Steve Kook, Steve Kook, Steve Kook, Steve Kook,
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.100]   gives his champing at the bit.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.860]   The host of security now to get a show underway.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.300]   And we started a little bit late today.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.660]   I apologize to everybody who's watching live, but I think it's a good time.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.940]   Andy, it looks like you've picked something specifically for me.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.580]   Specifically for us.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:03.380]   Now, earlier, actually late last year, I decided that, you know, it's time for me to learn
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.860]   how to sew.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:09.700]   And one of the things I was considering buying in February, I get my big windfall of like
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.260]   from recommending movies and movies and other stuff on Amazon over Black Friday.
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.900]   I get this big pile of Amazon credits because I'm an affiliate.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.660]   I never use Vertex up only for like things, books and movies and stuff like that.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.900]   And always treat myself to like fun things.
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.620]   I was thinking, I did buy myself a lens with the money.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.780]   I was going to, but I was thinking about buying myself a sewing machine.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:33.260]   But it got me, what got me interested in learning how to sew was this wonderful YouTube channel
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:36.620]   by a woman by the name of Bernard at Banner.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:42.860]   She has an incredibly, a really great talent for narrative storytelling.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:47.100]   She is a fashion historian who-
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.820]   So it's not just regular sewing.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.340]   It's Victorian sewing.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.340]   Right, right.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:56.260]   But it's not like, and so now here's how I chase down the sheep so that I could rip
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:58.260]   off the wool and create this.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.180]   It's very, but it's very, very traditional techniques.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.700]   So on one level, if you're not interested in sewing, the way that she tells this story
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:09.020]   of all the things that she's making or the thing that she's studying right now, she has
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:10.340]   a gift for this sort of stuff.
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.780]   And it's what makes YouTube so great.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:15.420]   I didn't have any particular interest in sewing.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.860]   I sew my own hems.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:19.220]   I hem my own pants like my grandmother taught me.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.020]   But that was, I didn't have any bug in my ear about doing this.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.340]   But after watching her doing so many hand sewing projects, I was like, maybe I should
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.900]   like learn how to sew some stuff.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.700]   Do you know how to sew?
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.420]   I did place it.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:36.020]   I decided not to get the sewing machine, but I do have what I could call the Bernadette
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.980]   Banner Junior Sewer Kit that I ordered on Amazon.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:45.020]   Like the two boxes of nothing but here are those little flamingos thread shears that
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.020]   she has.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.020]   Right.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.780]   And here's the chalk that she has and goes and stuff like that.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:54.860]   And so as luck would have it, I do have a couple of masks to go out with.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.860]   But I'm going to say, and sew some masks to see how much fun that could be.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:03.180]   But again, this is, so if you are thinking about hand sewing some stuff for the first
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:07.180]   time in your life, because you want it to hand sew masks, this will be very, very helpful.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:11.260]   She has like one video that's just all about like three different like classical hand sewing
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.660]   stitches that I was like practicing with a few days ago.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.740]   But what I'm saying is that it's the best that YouTube can offer because she's just
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.500]   really good at telling a story.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.580]   And when you're working with a really great storyteller, particularly one that's a really
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.580]   great video storyteller, it almost doesn't matter what the content is.
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.300]   You're just enjoying the story as it unfolds and very, very high recognition.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:37.260]   And also she hangs out with she has friends and colleagues in the sewing community, like
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:42.700]   the one with Kathy Hay that you now you click into her channels like, Oh, wow, she is amazing.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.460]   And now that's another couple of days shot.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:51.460]   So well, I thought you knew that I bought a sewing machine on the wheel for the weekend.
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.980]   I hope this was for me.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.540]   I'm not doing any hand sewing.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:58.220]   Sourdough starter and sewing machine.
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:01.540]   This is home economics with Leo.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:07.020]   I'm going to be I'm going to be sewing masks in my kitchen as you wait for your sourdough
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.020]   rice.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.700]   I think it's just so cute that you boys are so excited about having a sewing machine.
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:14.220]   Look, do you have a sewing machine, Laurie?
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.220]   Do you have a?
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.220]   Of course I do.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.220]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.220]   Do you know how to use it?
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.380]   I learned how to sew when I was seven.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:29.500]   And at long to get the same level, my mom tried to teach me how to sew, but I had no interest
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.500]   in that.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.980]   And you wanted to go play football instead.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   Exactly.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.980]   Guess what?
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:35.620]   Sewing is so much more important than football right now.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.380]   I wish I'd learned how to sew.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.340]   So I'm going to learn my defense in my defense.
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.740]   I didn't want to play football.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.580]   That seems like a very silly sort of.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.580]   I don't know.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.980]   I I'm going to make up for a last time though.
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.300]   I'm going to FaceTime mom and I'm going to say mom.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.300]   I got a sewing machine.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.700]   Can you teach me how to use it?
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.380]   I can't wait to find out that you've learned that you're learning how to knit or crochet
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:59.540]   and that you're going to show up with your needles to the show and just I already know
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.540]   how to knit.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.540]   Oh, good.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.540]   I learned that many years ago.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:06.660]   I haven't I don't do it on a regular basis, but I do know how to knit crochet.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:08.460]   Your mom is a superstar knitter.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.460]   She is.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   She is.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.460]   You have.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.460]   On a chronic cruise.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.460]   Yeah, she's really good.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.460]   She's any any fabric.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.260]   She's very good with the textile stuff.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.260]   Let's see.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.100]   I'm going to save Lori's for last.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:24.500]   But I am going to do Renee now because he's fully caffeinated.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.700]   All right.
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.300]   So I'm going to hold it up here.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.700]   So this is an arrow press.
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:34.820]   It is incredibly inexpensive way to make incredibly good coffee.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:38.860]   So if you just can't go to Dunkin Donuts, you can't go to Tim Hortons, you know, you
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:43.380]   can't get your Starbucks fix, whatever this, you know, you can get these fairly cheap.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:47.100]   They're like 29 bucks on the air press that I've seen them down for like 14 sometimes on
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.100]   sale.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:52.740]   And you basically get a little filter, you wet the filter, you put it on the little plastic
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:58.180]   cap, screw it in, put it on top of your mug, you fill it with your favorite ground coffee,
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.100]   fresh ground if you're one of those nerds, and then you pour boiling water, you wait,
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:05.300]   you stir it, you wait, and then you push it down.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.780]   I don't have the patience.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   I'm not like Daniel Bader.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.580]   I can't sit there and be all zen about a pour over and like spend like three minutes waiting
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.860]   for it to bloom.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:17.540]   I need my coffee now, but I don't want bad coffee now.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:21.780]   The AeroPress lets me get something that's pretty close to an espresso, or if you add
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:26.700]   hot water to it afterwards, pretty close to an Americano, very, very fast with minimal
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.580]   effort and almost no cleaning.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.020]   So I've been subsisting for regular coffee.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:36.000]   I've been subsisting on an AeroPress and they have a travel version too that you can take
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.540]   with you when we get to travel again.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.540]   But the basic AeroPress is like the best deal in coffee history.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:46.580]   Lisa does an AeroPress every darn morning.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:50.540]   We have a dozen of them it seems like, and there's about three here at work.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.860]   See, it's smart woman Leo.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:52.860]   I love the AeroPress.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.580]   It's the best way to make coffee.
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:56.580]   And it's inexpensive.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:00.860]   We own all these expensive coffee devices, but it's always back to the AeroPress.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.460]   And yeah, you walk by the $10,000 espresso machine with your AeroPress and you're just
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.460]   laughing.
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:09.940]   Just a tip though, because when we travel, when we used to travel, she would always pack
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.500]   the AeroPress and a bunch of coffee.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.500]   Just a tip.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.540]   I couldn't figure it out at first.
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.020]   Say, can you carry my coffee for me?
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:21.260]   That's because, yeah, you know what's coming.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:28.780]   I guess drug smugglers, pot smugglers, they'll put their drugs in a bunch of coffee to hide
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.340]   the smell from the dogs.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:35.300]   So every single time, what do you got in that bag Leo?
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.100]   It's coffee.
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.100]   It's just coffee.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:40.380]   I like that coming about in San Francisco with fills bags.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.220]   Like my half my luggage is filled with fills.
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.420]   It's just coffee.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:49.900]   It took us a while to figure that out.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:53.620]   Why they always search the bag with a coffee in it.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:57.740]   Let's wrap things up our pick of the week from Lori Gill.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:58.740]   Lori?
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:05.340]   So this week or this month is National Autism Awareness or Acceptance, depending on who you
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:07.020]   are, month.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:13.100]   And so I just wanted to kind of let everybody remind everybody to, you know, learn a little
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.180]   bit about autism.
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:22.900]   So my nephew is a spectrum kiddo and his mom uses autism speaks regularly to find resources
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:29.860]   and learn about programs and she has met and become good friends with a lot of people through
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:32.380]   the resources that come from autism speaks.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.460]   This is a fantastic website that is just full of information.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:41.460]   So whether you have someone in your family that's on the spectrum or you don't know anybody
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:46.260]   that's on the spectrum and you don't really understand the disorder, this is a great place
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.900]   to read about it, learn more about it.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:57.340]   I think one of the things that isn't as known about autism is that it ranges so widely that
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:04.020]   there are some high functioning autistic people that on the surface they just seem like maybe
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.820]   they are, you know, antisocial or something like that.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:09.580]   But there's more to it.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:13.300]   Many of the people who listen to this show and do this show are on the spectrum.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.540]   I'm almost certain.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:17.700]   So no, yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.780]   And there was always a lot of people in the tech industry, a lot of big names in the tech
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.340]   is there, see, are on the spectrum, absolutely.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.340]   Right.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:32.940]   And so what's important to do is not treat autism as some kind of thing to feel bad about
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:40.540]   or to be scared of or to not want to participate in, but to actually acknowledge and understand
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:45.700]   and you can interact with people in the spectrum just like you can interact with everyone else.
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.060]   They're just reading the world in a different way than you are and the way they react to
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:55.060]   things are different from what we see as the social standards.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:39:00.380]   So learning about autism so that you can be more accepting of it is also as important
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:04.260]   as being able to be with somebody on the spectrum.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:09.460]   Just, you know, when you're in the grocery store and there's some kid that's screaming
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:15.740]   and yelling and a parent who doesn't seem to be reacting to that, don't judge that parent.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:16.740]   That's right.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.740]   Right.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:18.740]   Right.
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:21.420]   Because there could be any number of causes for why that child might be screaming.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.980]   And one of them could be that that's a spectrum kid and that there's nothing that you can
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:28.820]   do to help that or stop that from happening.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:36.060]   So being aware and accepting autism and understanding that the spectrum is huge, it's not just,
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.500]   you know, people who can count toothpicks that fall on the ground.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.420]   They have all kinds of different levels.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.020]   Not all rain man.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.020]   Nope.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:45.020]   Exactly.
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.020]   So just get out there and learn about it.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:50.100]   And autism speaks is a really fantastic website for that kind of learning.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.820]   You know, I completely agree with you.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.380]   No many autistic people.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:40:00.060]   And I honestly think that even the larger statement is what we think of as a quote normal brain
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.900]   isn't.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:06.300]   And in fact, it's the unusual brains, the brains that think differently that often change the
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.780]   world around us.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:11.500]   So these are people that we celebrated.
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:17.860]   And it's not just autism, there's all kinds of oddball ways of ideating.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:21.980]   And just because they don't match ours or yours doesn't mean that they're in any way
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:27.460]   lesser, in fact, in many ways, I think they may have advantages over us.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.300]   Well, as always, the answer to most human questions is empathy.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.300]   You don't have to judge.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.300]   You don't have to guess.
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:35.460]   You don't do anything.
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.420]   You just simply have to appreciate that.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.420]   Seriously.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:41.020]   We all have a carry on a backpack.
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.860]   We all have different bricks in it.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:46.700]   And just because someone else's backpack has different bricks in it does not mean that
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:49.540]   you understand what their burden is and what they can and can't do.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.700]   My backpack definitely has bricks in it.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:57.500]   That analogy occurred to me like an age 14 as well.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.460]   It's probably because of my book bag.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:05.220]   I said, Oh God, why is this person putting another brick in my backpack?
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:08.060]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Mac Break Weekly for this week.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:15.260]   Laurie Gill, the awesome Laurie Gill is a what is your title now executive editor?
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:16.260]   What did you get?
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.700]   I like the sound of that.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.700]   Hey, executive editor at I'more.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.940]   There you go.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:21.940]   Senior editor.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.180]   Too bad there's no reason that goes along with us.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.340]   Renee's replacement.
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:28.340]   How about that?
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:29.340]   Let's be honest with you.
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:30.340]   Nobody can ever.
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.340]   Renee's upgrade.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.340]   Upgrade.
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:37.020]   You catch your band, sick burn someday when concerts happen again.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:39.140]   Maybe streaming, maybe streaming on the internet.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.060]   So you're looking at that, huh?
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.060]   That's really cool.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.540]   I mean, we're trying to figure things out.
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:44.540]   Let's see what happens.
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.340]   I'm loving all these living room concerts.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.260]   It's a little disappointed because I watched the iHeart one, which is a benefit and a good
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:51.260]   thing.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.740]   But it seemed like it was all prerecorded.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:42:00.300]   I love what I really enjoy is the liveness of what we do and seeing news anchors in their
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.140]   jammies and all of this.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:07.020]   I think this is one of the real benefits to be taken away from this is this kind of
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:10.420]   letting our hair down and being real and being live.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.380]   And I'm just enjoying it.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:15.340]   No end, especially since we've been doing it for 15 years.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:19.020]   Nice to see them finally catch up.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.020]   Andy and Akka, we'll see you.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.820]   WGBH and Boston will hear you anyway.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.740]   When's your next appearance?
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:29.860]   Looks like I'm on Fridays for the next few weeks, times to be announced.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:34.820]   But check my Twitter feed at an Akka, IH and ATKO where I usually announce hopefully the
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.260]   day before sometimes I don't, I forget until the morning of, but you can always stream at
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.820]   WGBH news.org.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:45.380]   They went over the live thing is and also like the past month or month and a half worth
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.380]   of seconds.
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.380]   Awesome.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.860]   And of course Renee Ritchie who's launched his own venture no longer.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:54.580]   I'm more now at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.820]   Are you any RIT CHIE?
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.820]   How's it going?
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:02.060]   Are you enjoying life as an independent?
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:05.940]   Like I said, it's like really terrifying, but also really exciting.
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:08.380]   And I was ping ponging back and forth between those two states.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:14.180]   But now I think I'm comfortably habitating in the middle and he's getting prizes.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:17.540]   Just how much you have to, like you don't think about like there's like where's the website?
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.540]   Where's this social thing?
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.540]   How is this plugged into this?
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.540]   Why can't I?
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.940]   Why didn't I have a community tab on my YouTube channel?
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:25.500]   Then this morning a thing pops up going, congratulations.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.380]   You've qualified for a community tab.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.380]   Wow.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.380]   I don't know all these things.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.380]   Yay.
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:32.380]   So you and exciting.
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.380]   Yeah, go to the community tab.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:35.860]   It's actually, YouTube really is its own culture now.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.780]   It's gotten very complicated and interesting.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:38.780]   You're a social network.
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:39.780]   Yeah, it is.
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:46.860]   And also, I mean, this is the opportunity for anybody who's older than like 32 to feel
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:51.180]   really, really old, because once again, the skills of people who are teenagers and either
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:54.940]   20s to again, I'm not, I'm not a woman smoke here.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:00.340]   I am so impressed with the level of camera work storytelling, how effectively they speak
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:03.180]   to camera, how effectively they don't speak to camera.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:09.620]   This is something that I have been on and off for the past 10 years since YouTube has become
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.060]   a real thing, longer than that.
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:15.980]   I have been trying to figure out how to do videos and I always get bogged down in my
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:20.740]   stupid generation X, but I have to script this out and okay, I need to retake that or
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:24.540]   I, and then forgetting that, yeah, you've left sort of like this shot static for the
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.180]   past three minutes.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:30.940]   And then I watched like this is 13, 13 year old, fully around with their 13 year old friend
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.460]   and it's brilliant.
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:36.380]   So goodness, but there's some talented, talented people working in YouTube.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.740]   I can't get enough of it.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:40.140]   It's great and it's authentic and it's real and it's.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140]   Exactly.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.300]   Yeah, I think that I think that was it.
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:46.180]   They, they, they grew up thinking of YouTube as something they can play with and have fun
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:50.380]   with as opposed to I have to, I want this to look like meet the press.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:53.380]   So I'm going to, I need to have a new table for here.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:57.180]   It's like, no, you just turn the camera on and you have fun and see what happens.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.900]   Well, like I was watching something tick tock like this person on tick tock has 40, 40
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.300]   million followers and she's just in her bedroom dancing and like the bathroom was open behind
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:05.300]   her.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.220]   The bed isn't made and it's got 30 million views.
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:08.740]   I'm like, yeah, it's fine.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.460]   I just, but I see that.
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.860]   I go, how, how, how, how.
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:15.420]   We're the old Leo.
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:16.420]   We don't know.
