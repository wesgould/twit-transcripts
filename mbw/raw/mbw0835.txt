[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We are here.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.920]   Now six days after the Apple event,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480]   to take a look at it with the cold, clear light of day,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.720]   Jason Snell and the Enoco.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.840]   Alex Lindsey will talk about some of the new features in the iPhone,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.000]   how hard it was to get the iPhone on the first day.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.320]   Plus, what we can expect next month from Apple.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   And yes, I know we're a week late, but we are not a dollar short.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.280]   We're about $15,000 short, I think.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.760]   After all the purchases, Jason Snell is here from sixcolors.com.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.960]   And the incomparable, hello, Jason.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.840]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.720]   It's hard to believe that it's been less than a week.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.640]   But it's good.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.200]   We have like deep thoughts and the perspective a little bit now.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   Yes, we have emerged from the reality distortion field.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Mostly intact.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.840]   Andy Inaco WG, VH Boston.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   That's right.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.680]   This is the best and the worst time to talk about an Apple event because now we've figured
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.120]   out how much we've been lied to and cheated by the man.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.480]   You hear that the man?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.880]   We are eyes are fully open now.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   WG.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.960]   No, no, that's Andy.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.920]   Your office hours done.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.720]   I've taken over.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   No dot media.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   My bank account is so much lighter.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600]   So, it's more efficient.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   More air.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.360]   Public radio cannot afford Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.600]   But get ready because October is going to be even more expensive.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   We have two chips.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   I'm two chips on maybe a macro.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   Yeah, that's going to be expensive.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.320]   So before we get into the deets, let's start by saying upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.840]   Mac OS, iOS, iPad OS, everything OS.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.200]   They all have a zero day that is significant and you must update right now.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.240]   So update all the things.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.320]   I did that before I came in.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.840]   It's not a lengthy update.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.120]   It was weird because I knew yesterday that I would be getting iOS 16.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.560]   And when I launched the updater, it said 15 seven and I thought.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.440]   Now, Lisa's had a thing below it because she's an iOS.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   She's an iPhone 13.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   I'm only a 12 that said, oh, or you could just go to 16, which would obviously be the
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   right answer.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.040]   But for me, I didn't see that.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440]   Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see it.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   So I went to 15 seven and then iOS 16.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.840]   It's a very important update.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   You must get it.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   CV 2022 329 or one seven allows a malicious app to run arbitrary code on an effective device
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.000]   with kernel privileges.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.040]   That sounds bad and it may have been actively exploited.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.480]   It may have according to Apple.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.160]   So that's that's why I'm somewhat urgently encouraging you to update.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   99% of the people out there, they don't use the kernel app and they've never heard of
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   it.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   They don't care.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.240]   They stick with a big deal as a tenant or general, but who needs a kernel?
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.000]   No, you all use the kernel.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.080]   So get going.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.000]   Fix it right away.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.840]   This is boy.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.400]   This is the second zero day in as many weeks, I think, or certainly that zero day for the
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.120]   WebKit was fairly recent.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.280]   So anyway, get on in there.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.360]   I guess if you go to 16, you have all of that as well.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.720]   Yeah, same thing with Chrome.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.960]   It's like anything that can possibly render a Web page, you really got on top of it.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   And that's the reason why you don't.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   If there even five years ago, I think we had the luxury of thinking that, oh, well, geez,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   I'm kind of busy right now.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.120]   I don't think it's asking me to do a system update.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.760]   Maybe I'll wait until tomorrow or I'll maybe take it off until about a week.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.640]   And then now it's like, yeah, I should make sure I get that done within memory of this
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   alert.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.240]   Jason, you along with Micah, were at the beautiful Apple campus for the event last Wednesday.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   You were.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.340]   How was it?
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.480]   It was amazingly exactly like the last event there three years ago.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.800]   Except it was on tape.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.820]   Yeah, so much has changed.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.980]   We've been through so much.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.020]   Apple, which relied on its sort of system of doing product announcements instead, did
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.780]   pre, you know, they came up with their whole prerecorded event thing.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.980]   And they as a reviewer, they started doing like briefings on WebEx and FedExing us product
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.320]   where it always used to be, you know, you needed to appear in person and get a briefing
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   in person.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.020]   And then they'd hand you the bag with your review unit and you'd walk out.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.640]   And so they completely rejiggered all of that and yet flash forward to September 2022.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.060]   And it was a lot like 2019.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.340]   Other than the fact that there was other than Tim Cook saying hello, nobody on stage.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.460]   They just played the same video that everybody else saw.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.380]   However, literally everything else is the same sort of group of people milling about
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.780]   outside the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.940]   You go into the theater, you take your seat, you watch a presentation, you get back up.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.340]   There's a hands on area.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.700]   And then, you know, some people get briefings right then and take away stuff and other people,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.900]   you know, wait to, you know, or just leave.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.580]   And I did a podcast there and like it was otherwise completely normal.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.660]   I heard a couple Apple executives afterwards saying they were really happy to like have
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.260]   the event on campus and have it back.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.660]   I actually think it's going to be like this from now on, which is because the truth is
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.100]   it's not as if that presentation that was live on stage was interactive.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.900]   For those of us in the audience, it's not like we could, you know, Tim, I've got a question.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.420]   Did you feel like you missed anything by not having them do the presentations live?
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   Like the?
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.420]   No, no.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.740]   I mean, other than being in the presence, right?
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.100]   Like speaking of the queen, that idea of being in the presence of whoever your Apple executives
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.780]   or celebrities or whatever.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.700]   But other than that, it isn't again, not an interactive presentation.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.940]   You're still sitting on your butt looking at people on the stage and then leaving.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.020]   And so I heard some, there was some grousing from some members of the press are like, we
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.580]   came all this way for this.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.460]   But it's like, is it that different?
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.300]   I like philosophically seriously.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   Is it that different?
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.620]   If all you're doing is sitting there and watching it, the reason you're there is for the hands
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.060]   on and for the briefings and all of those things that go along with it.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.340]   And for the sandwiches, did they give you sandwiches a little back?
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.020]   Oh, I have a little fluffle afterward for lunch.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.180]   It was really good.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   Very nice.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.540]   Is it vegetarian spread or do they?
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.500]   Was that just a Steve Jobs thing?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.380]   They will sometimes have neat things, but they always make sure to have a vegetarian and
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.940]   a vegan option.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.340]   And you know, they've got all of the and gluten free and like they've got all that stuff marked.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:54.300]   It's very, very much the you're kind of modern variety, but with with warning labels.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.180]   Can they tell you what the pastry pronouns were though?
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.620]   They I didn't ask because you know, the key key thing Leo before pro tip before you go
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.140]   to the apple event is stop eating and drinking because you've got it.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.540]   Who knows how long you're going to be sitting there.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   That's true.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.540]   Those 14,000.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   You don't want to get up in the middle.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.540]   Cheers.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   Just hold on.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.540]   Can you easily be soiled?
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.540]   Are they comfy chairs?
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.540]   Do you like them?
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.020]   For theater chairs.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.860]   I mean, compared to something like the town hall that they have at infinite loop, which
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.860]   they used to do events in.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860]   One pleasant.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.860]   Just DPM pleasant chairs.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.860]   Much nicer.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.860]   It's very no expense.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.860]   Paris Paris Martin.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.860]   Oh, so the 90 minute event could just have been an email.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860]   That's kind of mean.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   A little snarky.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.020]   I would say that they that was a 90 minute event that would have been more than two hours
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.860]   if it had been a stage show in person.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.860]   Right.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.860]   I think it gets it's much higher density as a pre tape scripted commercial.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.780]   And it's fun to see like later on like the levels of access that different people have
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.780]   where number one, there's a level of access where yes, you got invited to the event and
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.380]   I'm not and I'm not suggesting there's anything hinky going on there.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.420]   Apple can invite whoever they want to invite.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.980]   And then there's the people who get the special briefings and then like two or three
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.340]   days later, like the day of the event, I'm like, gee, it's kind of weird that I just
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.580]   think that Christine is like doing her like during her like talking head like from the
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.940]   main scrum of this beta area of this of this demo area.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.820]   And then of course, like a day later, like she and a couple others like have videos posted
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.140]   which she's alone in like the in the saucer in the saucer ceiling building.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.220]   And it's like, yes, that's exactly it.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.380]   So I think so that's they're always going to have a live portion of that because it's
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:48.340]   always there there are audiences that they can attract in the volume that they want to
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.980]   Apple wants to attract on the day they want to attract by making sure that the people
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.020]   who have the sort of audiences have a special reason to come down there.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.780]   They wouldn't come down there if it were just, hey, come down, fly all the way down here,
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.900]   sit through a video for 90 minutes and then go home even if we involve like coming home
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.940]   with a bag full of hardware.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.460]   It's like there are reasons to come down there and part of the reasons is to really take
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.900]   advantage of the space.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:21.100]   Okay, I mean, we watched here Andy and I we weren't horribly jealous.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.540]   No, maybe of the croissants and the falafel.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.020]   I'm glad to still have $1,200 in my bank account that I could not spend on like getting
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.700]   the new iPhone or getting the new watch or something like that.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.420]   Yeah, so he's talking about the flight out because you have to go on the East Coast.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.060]   For Jason and Micah, it was just down the road.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.060]   So it wasn't too long.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.060]   It was taking a drive.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.220]   It was a long road and there's a really big bump on to it.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.180]   It's always that one that just your car takes off and lands on the way down here.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.660]   Speed limit, speed limit.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.500]   I do hate it today.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.420]   Yeah, I hate it.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.300]   It's hard on 280 because it's so wide open.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.020]   It's like 17 lanes.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.180]   It feels like and it's like eight miles to the exit.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.940]   There's this one bridge that I always have to remember.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.580]   I just want him.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.820]   Let me think.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.860]   Well, because you were there, Jason, I'll give you a little pride of place.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:21.660]   Was there anything you saw that knocked your socks off or more than one thing is fine?
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:29.180]   I think the big thing that was the surprise and says a lot about a lot of things.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.740]   There's a lot about Apple's ambitions.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.580]   There's a lot about what the rumors are and where they come from.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.500]   Is this idea of the dynamic island?
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:43.980]   I want to start with the name because nothing says we wish we had named the notch so people
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.340]   call it something that isn't the notch like calling this the dynamic island.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.940]   They lost control of the narrative there and they're like, "No, no, no.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.940]   It's an island, people, a dynamic island."
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:01.020]   You really have to admire their ability to take a negative and turn it into, I think
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.700]   at least it looks like a positive.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.700]   I don't know.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   It's called lemonade.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.700]   Exactly.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.300]   They should go with the lemonade draw.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.700]   It's beyond lemonade.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.380]   Those of you who listened to Leo and I last week show them this could see how excited
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.580]   I was about it.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.820]   There's one thing about saying, "Okay, well, we masked this enough that you don't notice
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.100]   that this was a design problem that we solved."
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.420]   It's truly like you could...
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   Apple could make the claim that no, no, no.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.220]   We were working up to this for the past three or four years and this is what it just took
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.780]   us a while before we get the sensors into that one little pill that we always wanted
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.780]   for the iPhone X.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.780]   I'm sure there's not...
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.580]   It wouldn't put it on the notch.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.620]   I notice on the iPhone 14 and 14 plus.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.580]   So I think it wouldn't work as well with the notch.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:53.060]   Another quick thing about the notch though, someone overlaid screenshots that the notch
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.420]   actually intrudes vertically into the screen less than the pill.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   That's an interesting choice.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.740]   They chose to make it drift down in that island there.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.980]   That's what they chose to do this time.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.180]   When I saw it, I could think of for some reason.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.580]   I was picturing Larry David just going, "It's not.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.580]   It's not.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.580]   I don't care.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.580]   It's not."
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.580]   I kind of like the notch.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.860]   It's like this black spot where I put on my video.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.860]   A pill.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   Who wants a pill?
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860]   I'm trying to get $12,000 worth of that.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.500]   I got pills in my life.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.460]   So if we talk about the rumors here, it's these two cutouts and everybody's like, "Oh, it's
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.060]   going to be a whole punch and a little oval hole punch and that's going to be it."
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.380]   And it shows you, first off, that so many rumors come out of the supply chain.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.300]   Where all they know, it's the three blind men in the elephant.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   There's Larry David.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   It's not.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   I'm in the elephant.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   They're like, "No, it's too much."
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   It's too strange.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   It's not.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   It's not.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   It's a change of name.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   Exactly.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.460]   But what's actually happening is software.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.220]   I really think they've had the last five years since they did the notch to think, "Well, if
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.020]   we can get it smaller, could we embrace it?
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.340]   Could we build UI around it and turn it into a feature?"
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.020]   And that's not something that we all got as a rumor because that was deep inside Cupertino
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.020]   right?
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   Yeah, that wasn't a supply chain.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.020]   It's just on the assembly line.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.020]   And I love their ambition there, right?
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.220]   Because it is turning a negative into a positive.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.620]   It's like, well, if we dance around the UI, if we dance around those little holes, and
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.900]   it's almost as if they disappear, whereas the notch is like, "Just don't look at it.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.900]   Okay, just don't look at it."
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.900]   It's not a pill.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.980]   It's a permanent widget kind of a thing.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.980]   Here's the...
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   It turns to a status down.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980]   It turns to a status down.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.980]   It turns to a status down.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.980]   It turns to a status down.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.460]   By a Reddit, it's an iPhone Reddit.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.860]   So the 14 and the 14 Pro split and superimposed.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.260]   So you see the pill is actually...
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.260]   Further down.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.260]   It's a smaller.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.260]   Very good.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.260]   I think that's right.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   Further down.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:53.620]   It's narrower, but I think it's a slightly bigger, taller than the notch.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.980]   But I also think that the fact that you do get some active pixels above it on top of
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.580]   the pill, that's what makes dynamic island possible.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.140]   Otherwise, it does a dynamic peninsula.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.940]   But also visually...
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.460]   Nobody wants a dynamic peninsula.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.300]   Here we go.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.820]   You know they're thinking we could have called the notch the static peninsula.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.860]   People would have eaten that up, kicking themselves.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.860]   It's not a notch.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.660]   It's a peninsula.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.660]   Okay.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.660]   I can't ask you this, Jay.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.940]   I'm going to do this, Jason.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.300]   So just wink.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.140]   Besides...
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.420]   So have you had any experience of it other than in the hands-on?
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.420]   No.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.140]   I can give you the official canary, which is I was not one of those people who stayed
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.140]   fine and got a briefing.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.660]   Tomorrow you might get it.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   Maybe.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   That's usually how it works, right?
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   Is that the second wave people get it after the embargo drops.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   Right.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   I would really judge how the utility or the...
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   I mean, there may be a high annoyance factor with that thing going...
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.660]   I would say...
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.860]   I would say we won't be able to judge it even when it ships.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.860]   And this is why.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.820]   It's because this is part of this action widget framework that they announced in June.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.660]   The idea that you have live actions as widgets and show things like a baseball game or now
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.220]   playing in the music app.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.340]   This is the other shoe of that dropping, which is that this is the same API does the stuff
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.340]   around the dynamic island.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.420]   Well, the thing is that's a coming later feature for everybody but Apple.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   So third party stuff is going to be really...
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.940]   It's going to take a few months for the third parties to support this.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.940]   And I feel...
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.180]   So I feel like out of the gate, it's going to be a little thin because it's just going
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.020]   to be Apple stuff.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.980]   And then there's going to be like a software update and we're going to get third party
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.660]   apps that embrace the dynamic island.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.020]   They move out to the island.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   And then we'll see how it is.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.260]   But I think it's going to take a while for the uptake from the developers to come in.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.780]   And thank you Apple for making an API or whatever they call it, a kit for this because it is
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.100]   nice that other apps can use it, especially because apps are going to take over the whole
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.380]   screen.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.260]   So it's very nice that an app can somehow integrate that thing, that whole into something.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.820]   And that's something that Apple can do that Google can't.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.380]   Google's a couple of iterations of Google.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.420]   Google is trying to get away from the pill, right?
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   Well, no, not a...
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.420]   I'm talking about the pill.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:24.500]   I'm talking about how a few iterations of Android ago, they came up with this really
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.220]   interesting idea of having apps have access to picture in picture, just like YouTube.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.820]   So that if you're in Google Maps, for instance, and you're on a bus or you're on a train or
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.940]   whatever, you can actually keep an active Google Maps view of where you are so that you don't
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.540]   miss your stop and stuff like that.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.620]   And they opened that up to third parties, but Google doesn't have the ability to either
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.020]   by making it so attractive as Apple makes their stuff attractive or by strong arming
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.500]   their developers, the way that Apple strong arms their developers, to actually convince
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.380]   so many third parties to actually take advantage of it.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.340]   And the thing that I miss a lot that's so obvious about phones is there are times where
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.940]   there is an ongoing thing that an app is doing in the background that you want to be able
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.020]   to keep an eye on.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.060]   Even if it's just that I want to actually have a persistent thing that says, "Here's
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:19.700]   how long this call has been running," or "Here's where this source of this audio is
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.900]   coming from and I want to be able to mute and control there," or the gold standard,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.860]   which they demonstrated, which is, "When is how long is it going to take for my lift
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   to get here?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.580]   Do I have time to brush my teeth or am I going to have to hot dog it?"
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.300]   When I get to the office, when I get to the office later that day, Apple's going to be
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.180]   able to actually take advantage of it.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.100]   Now maybe they'll, maybe for all we know when we're being really optimistic, I'm being
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.980]   really excited about it, but it could be just as bad a situation as the, I still can't remember
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.340]   what Apple's official name for that stupid little OLED strip above the keyboard was.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.100]   But nobody really, thank you very much.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.500]   The touch bar, nobody really supported it.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.900]   There was some fun to play doom on the touch bar, but it didn't become the sort of thing
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.020]   where all of the apps used find a creative and productive way to use it.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.340]   So maybe we're just being optimistic here, but I don't think so.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.460]   I think this is something that every app is going to want to be able to say, "Look how
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.260]   modern we are.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.700]   Look how much you're getting for your $5 a month or whatever we're charging for subscription.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.700]   We're making this better.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.700]   We're making this more modern.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.460]   We're making this the equivalent of every single Apple app that's out there.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.860]   I'm feeling pretty good about it.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.500]   How long before Android phones start copying it, right?
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.060]   Oh my God, it already happened.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.540]   It already happened on a theme.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.300]   Oh God, not a theme of launcher.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:45.860]   No, show me this is the dynamic island on a show me phone.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.860]   Sure.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Why not?
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:53.460]   I think in general the general press reaction to dynamic island has been extremely positive
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.340]   like Andy and mine.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.140]   The real question will be once we get it in our hot little hands.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.180]   Yeah, how does it work in practice?
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.940]   Because I mean, it is like Andy said, really a great idea to say, "Phone screens are too
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:11.020]   small for multitasking, but what about an active background information area?"
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.660]   You can tap and hold and it brings up a more dynamic kind of control.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.460]   Although again, my understanding is that those aren't really interactive if you're not Apple.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.260]   Third party apps are less interactive.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.260]   Oh, is that true?
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.260]   I think so, but you can see a direction that they're headed here, which is this is almost
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.060]   like something like the Mac menu bar for the iPhone, right?
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.540]   It's a place that you can put little menu bar items essentially and say, "Here's what
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   else is going on."
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.700]   I think that that is a, again, there's that saying about how if you put constraints on
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.940]   creative people, sometimes they do their best work, this feels like that.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.980]   This feels like Apple looking at those holes in their display and being like, "We've got
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.580]   to do something."
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:54.180]   In doing that, they came up with a rethinking, like a major rethinking of how iOS works on
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.180]   phones.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.780]   Yeah, it's got a lot of potential.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.860]   Even though I'm with Andy, we're going to get it and there's going to be like, "Oh,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.420]   it doesn't do this and it's going to be one of those things we have to wait maybe
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   a year for."
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.060]   But I think it's got huge potential.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:13.420]   Alex, when you were all watching on Office Hours, did you notice any edits, any jump
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.820]   cuts, any problems, anything we might have missed?
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.180]   Yeah, there was a lot of, I mean, we discussed a lot of things.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.100]   There was a long discussion about whether what parts were green screen and what weren't.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.740]   It looked like it felt like it was almost all green screen.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.540]   I don't think it was.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.940]   How did they do?
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.580]   Boy, this drove me nuts.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.900]   This is when they're demonstrating the AirPods Pro 2.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.940]   At first, she's in a subway station.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.100]   Looks like, in fact, she's on a subway car.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.740]   Looks very much like an ear, a subway car.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.980]   Gets out of the car, walks out the door of the station.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.980]   Suddenly, she's on the street with a guy in a jackhammer, then walks off the street into
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:57.100]   a cafe and then they pan back and it looks like it's three sets.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.100]   That's not.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.820]   That's all fake.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820]   I don't know yet.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.820]   You know, like, we don't know.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.460]   I think that that could have been.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.100]   And some of those effect shots could definitely be fake.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.060]   What we were really talking about is when the presenters, in those effect shots, you
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.780]   could absolutely fake that, have her do what she needs to do on a green screen and then
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.780]   swap things out.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.820]   I'm wondering if they used the volume, the big space that the Mandalorian uses.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.380]   Not out of the question.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.380]   Not out of the question.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.380]   They could afford it.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.140]   They might have a giant micro LED screen in the basement.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.180]   Well, you would go to the space.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.220]   It takes so much to set it up that they would just go to.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:35.140]   They'd talk to Ilem and say, "Hey, can we shoot there?"
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.060]   What we were really looking at is when the presenters were standing, we were trying to
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.940]   decide, "Is that big screen?
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.580]   Are they in front of a screen or are they in front of a green screen?"
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.140]   And then they're keying it all in.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.260]   The things that we were looking at were the kind of hair that was the little boy ways.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.660]   Yeah, that's what we were looking at.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.660]   We were looking at fly ways.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.820]   Everybody had shadows on the floor.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.500]   What we noticed was there was an argument that it's all green screen except that we
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   were on the ground.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   So look at this room.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.540]   This is, so this is, I lost it.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:14.500]   There's places where the presenters are talking and they zoom into another space.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.460]   I feel, okay, so this one.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   What's watching that?
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   So how realistic, this could be a drone shot.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.780]   Okay, now he's got to be on a green screen, I think.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.780]   Jeff Williams.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.780]   I don't know, I don't think so.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.780]   That's real.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.780]   That would be really hard.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   It'd be really hard to move with the screen.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.740]   I heard someone behind the scenes that most of this stuff is practical.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.900]   I think that the slides are fake, but I think their locations are real.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.900]   Let me go back.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.460]   Those locations look exactly like that.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.500]   He's finished, Jeff Williams finishes speaking.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   And then we...
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   What?
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   Oh, you see the distortion there?
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.220]   All right, so that was just a cut.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   That was a cut.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   Okay, never mind.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.220]   Well, yeah.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.860]   There was a little distortion that was hiding the cut.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.340]   But I think that screen, maybe the screen is there as a rectangle.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.340]   But what's on the screen is obviously...
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.340]   I agree.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.340]   I agree.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.940]   I think that it's practical, but there is a screen holding space there.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.620]   Now, when she's not in front of it, they could just add it in.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.220]   They didn't really put Jeff Williams on a rock.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.260]   Do you think that they did?
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.260]   I think they did.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.260]   I think they did.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.260]   What?
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.100]   Actually, now we have a conversation about that.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.900]   Did they drop him in with a drone shot?
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.340]   No, you can walk up from the back.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.860]   It looks like someone in place is way more impressive.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.940]   He's on the Apple campus, and then he's out in the wilderness.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.700]   That's one of those examples of Apple.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.060]   I mean, I know this is weird to say, but I love that Apple is actually pushing their
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.060]   filmmaking.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.220]   I mean, Tim called it a film.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.500]   It's like, okay, whatever.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.420]   But they are ambitious with it.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   That shot with the three, the trip-titch there of the subway and the jacket.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.300]   You're back to go into it.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.620]   And that move where they pull back and reveal that it's all kind of like in that set.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.900]   That's unnecessary, right?
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.700]   That is a flourish that they just did for fun.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.080]   And Jeff Williams going from Apple Park to out in the middle of the wilderness and then
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   not caring.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.320]   And when they're not trying to pretend that these people are in these places, they know
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.240]   that they go from place to place.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.960]   Like they're really kind of evolving how they communicate in these videos.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   I love it because they could be a lot lazier.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.360]   And it's so Alex, this is the volume has to be, right?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.800]   That's pretty close to be a volume.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.280]   So like putting things really, really close to you in the volume is not usually what you
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   would do.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   You'd usually have that close.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.360]   You'd probably have something physical there.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.000]   But the volume is- How they bouncing are, is she in a box that they're bouncing?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.720]   Well sometimes you put people on things and move them a little bit.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.680]   It's not practically to get them to do what they do.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.960]   And then it's a screen outside the subway car to- It could be.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.320]   Now that could be the volume or it could be something else or it could just be a big
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.880]   screen or it could be just green.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.560]   Like that's something that green screen would be really good at.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.480]   Because she's not moving so there's no perspective issues or anything with that.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.320]   Although the camera is moving.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.640]   The light through the windows matching is very impressive if that's a- Now watch this.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   I think she's in.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.200]   She's walking out of the subway station.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   I guess you could put a cut there.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   So what you do is you use those walls as wipes.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   And so then you match the shots.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.400]   That's what they did in that amazing movie with the drummer.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.480]   And again, the cork man.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   When you go back.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   Where she just was there.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   The super shot.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   The whole movie.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   Bird man was a whole single shot.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   The whole thing.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   But it was all done with wipes.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   So here what I would do.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   I don't know what they did here.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.760]   But what I would do is everything until the street would have been practical and the street
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   itself might do not.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.360]   So everything else.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.960]   Everything up to where those alert cones are would be practical.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   And then I might do.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   You could have foreground practical.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.440]   She opened that door.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.640]   But then it could be from the door back.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.480]   I know where that cafe is too.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   It's definitely a real cafe.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.000]   The outdoor scene in San Francisco.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.640]   There is real obviously.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.800]   But the alley seems like the alley in the Jackhammer Manor fake.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.400]   Is this too distracting or maybe is it just us?
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.200]   No, no, no.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.880]   There's something even do Apple.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.440]   It looks like Apple actually had an Easter egg in that subway scene for severance.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   The Apple TV show.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   The character from San Francisco.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   No.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   No.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   But Ellie is in the subway.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.480]   Oh, I thought I saw Ellie.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.440]   I saw Redhead come out the door of the subway.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   Was that Ellie?
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Oh my God.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.640]   I put a link in the notes for you.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   Watch, watch, watch.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   It's a Tom's government.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   There she is.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   There's Ellie.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   Oh, that's it.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.960]   She makes another appearance at the very post credit scene.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.800]   The video glitches out for a second, which I thought was super weird until I realized
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   that oh, I don't.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   I was doing all my I saw that and I thought oh, she just looks like Ellie.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.160]   They couldn't possibly get the actor to come up.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   It's called money.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.320]   That turns out if you have enough money, you can get the opportunity to do.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.800]   That's not even a cameo.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.280]   The camera stand Lee would even take that.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.280]   That's amazing.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.680]   Oh, that's a camera stand Lee would have been there.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   Don't worry about that.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.080]   That AirPods thing segment was the most sort of like tech forward where they were really
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.160]   pushing it in terms of visuals.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.200]   Also I don't know if I'm sure Alex noticed with the because she's talking about music
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.960]   and there's a lot of background sound happening while she's talking.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.720]   I thought it was the most aggressively clearly looped dialogue of any of the performers.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.160]   I think maybe that Apple employee also was not an expert at ADR, which nor should she
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   be.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.280]   But so it felt the most artificial of any of the segments to me.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.160]   I think maybe that's why they made the visuals look that way.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.440]   I think a lot of things were looped.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.320]   So I do think that they were an audio.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.080]   That was aggressive though.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.440]   That was really aggressively re-recorded.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.320]   For the non-cinema, Cine-S here, that's where you have after the fact additional dialogue
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   recording.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.800]   You know, mash potatoes, mash potatoes, mash potatoes in the background.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.320]   To get the lips to match but with a clear audio track.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.720]   And she, I mean, because the audio mixing on that, like because she's got a background,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.360]   like when Jaws is standing there saying, "Oh, the new iPhone Pro is great."
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.440]   Like you could probably capture that audio.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   Maybe not, right?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.640]   Like it could, it's could be a graveyard.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.480]   If she, it depends on whether she was really outside or not.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.400]   You know, the places that we thought when someone's on a cliff, we were thinking that's
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   probably any harm.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.480]   Oh, the guy, the guy on the boat with the wind blowing, right?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   Like no way.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.080]   And we have to realize that like, you know, so is this person, is this person really in
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   a field?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   I think she is.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   Yeah, I think she is.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.920]   That would mean it would mean it's easy to do.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.000]   It's cheaper probably to put her, it says helicopter to a field than is to bring her into
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   the volume.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.520]   And their place is relatively close to Northern California where you could do a shoot like
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   that.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.760]   And then she might have also been on the same shoot as Jeff Williams.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.280]   They might have gone to Highway 120 and she's out in Twalmi Meadows or something like that.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   Like you could do that in a couple of days.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.400]   I thought it might be Boulder Creek as you're going over 92 from 280 to Highway 1.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   Even easier.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.640]   That's like a minute's away from Coopitino.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.760]   That's an interesting question though that now there are people who scour, ah, sorry, big
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   truck outside.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   It's a great idea for a knock-o.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   Can you get in here?
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.880]   We're going to loop that down a little later.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.640]   I don't know why I spent so many hundreds of thousands of dollars having an LED stick
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.520]   stage put up just to make it look like I've got cheap shoji screens behind me.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   But you know what?
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.560]   I'm playing the double bluff.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.720]   But yeah, but I wonder if some people who are really, really, really into like reporting
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.480]   on like when is the dates going to be and what are they showing?
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.000]   Are they now going to start to look in the look in California database for what companies
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.560]   have secured filming permits for what locations?
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.200]   Because those weren't stolen shots.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.160]   This isn't the view of SKU universe.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.800]   When you're working on a film, you spend a lot of time obscuring that.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.200]   So it would be a lot of work to figure that out.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.560]   If you didn't talk to people who were on the…
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.320]   I bet you guys had a lot of fun on office hours.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.800]   There's a lot to live in.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   There was a lot to dig into.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.240]   I mean, I think that we spent three quarters of the time talking about the event.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.160]   I mean, the shoot and only one quarter of them were talking about the hardware because
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   I mean, not what was good.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   We were like, "Oh, that's good.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   That's good.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   That's great."
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160]   But really focus things on it.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   Well, there's some things you guys would have been interested in.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.880]   But we'll get to that.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.680]   I think the new…
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.160]   If it works, the new stabilization features in the iPhone camera video…
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   The big action mode.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   Action mode.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   Action mode.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   I mean, that's going to put some…
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.520]   That's got a scare DJI because that's all.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   It's got to put some gimbals out of business.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   48 megapixels.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   8 megapixels.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   ProRes.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520]   That's got to be interesting.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.440]   That's because you have 48 pixels.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.920]   You reduce it down.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.160]   I don't know if it's 12 megapixels for 4K, but…
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   I think it's…
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.000]   You're bending is something we're really interested in.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.520]   And that way you can…
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   Without…
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   And so you're not moving the sensor for OAS.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:47.360]   Well, the issue is that the CMOS sensor, the red, green, and blue are not on top of
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   each other.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.360]   Right.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.160]   So every CMOS image is soft.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   Right.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   And it's so sharpened.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   You also get jelly roll.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   Well, you're still going to get that.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.800]   In fact, the 48 is even harder to deal with because it's so much more that you're pushing
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.760]   through that that's a rolling shutter.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.160]   I don't think that they fix that.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.880]   So anyway, that'd be really expensive.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.160]   That's the Pro Pro version, the Ultra Pro or whatever.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   Later is the…
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   We'll get that later.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.480]   When Apple says they're going to add a global shutter to a camera, I'll be like, "Oh,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   that's the…"
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.400]   They're taking all the gloves off.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.720]   So the interesting thing there, and I don't know what the configuration is inside of the
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.920]   binning, but let's say if they have four times as many pixels that they need, they
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.720]   have a red, green, blue, and white in the pixel.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.000]   And it is essentially the same as saying you're stacking them like the phobion sensor.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.400]   And so the 12 megapixels potentially is going to be a lot sharper and a lot…
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.200]   There'll be less errata.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.600]   So it'll be a lot sharper and potentially much better low light, which they talked about.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.720]   And so we don't know if that's the case or not, but it was worth me buying a phone.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.200]   Like that's the only reason I bought the phone.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   Was the binning?
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Like I just saw the phone.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   I saw binning.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   I was like, "Oh, I got to know if this works."
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   What was your experience like?
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   Well, actually, let's take a break.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.400]   Then we'll talk about Friday, 5am.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.800]   Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   refresh, refresh, refresh.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.200]   It was not a good experience.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.480]   All right, first though.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.160]   I love it the day after or the week after an Apple event.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.400]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:26.040]   Alex Lindsey, Jason Snell, Andy Enaco, our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.000]   If you want to get an IT, and I know a lot of our audience, you know, you're watching
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   our shows, you're techy, but maybe it's a hobby for you.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   Maybe you've got a job you're not as crazy about as your hobby.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.920]   Wouldn't you like to make your hobby your job?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.680]   That's what it's all about with ITProTV.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.600]   The best possible IT training, whether you're getting into IT, and for that you usually need
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.760]   some certs like the A+ cert to kind of prove that you have the skills so you can get that
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.040]   first job, or you're already in IT and you want to accelerate your career.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.120]   You want to recertify, you want to get new skills, you want to polish up your existing
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   skills.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.240]   ITProTV is the best way to do it because the content is great.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.600]   It's always fresh.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.040]   They have seven studios working all day, Monday through Friday, to create new content
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.600]   because the test changes, the software changes, there's new certs, there's lots to do, and
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:23.200]   that content goes right from the studio into their library within 24 hours.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.480]   We always say they have 5,800 hours of on-demand IT training, but it's not always the same
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   5,800 hours.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.680]   It's constantly being refreshed.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   That's number one.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.480]   You're getting the freshest content.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.280]   You're also getting the best instructors.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   They call them edutators.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.880]   I don't know.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.840]   I'm not sure I'd call you an edutainer.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.760]   Sometimes they start by being experts in the field.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   That's important.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.540]   But what they're smart about doing, they hire ITPro's who are passionate about what they
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.800]   do, who love it.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.680]   That's what makes it entertaining.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:00.440]   They're funny and fun people, but they also have a real passion for the field.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.080]   That's what makes learning engaging.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.560]   That's what makes it stick in your mind.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.040]   All the episodes, 20 to 30 minutes long, so you can watch them during breaks.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.880]   You can watch them at your convenience, and you can watch them anywhere you want on your
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.720]   phone and your desktop, on your Apple TV, on your Roku.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:22.760]   You can integrate it into your existing life and existing job and get that IT training.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:28.120]   They have so much more virtual labs, which means you can practice in your browser, on
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.880]   Windows servers and Windows clients, that kind of thing.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   They have practice tests.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.720]   You can take the exams before you take the exams, which I think is really important.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.600]   One reviewer said, "It's easy to understand what they're saying.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   It's well explained.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.800]   The classes are very smooth, along with the notes and transcription given."
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.520]   I forgot to mention that they've got great notes and transcriptions for everything.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   I'll continue on.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.200]   "By wrapping their own experience in with the course, it makes it easier to comprehend
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.520]   the hardest topics.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.760]   They also make sure you feel confident enough to pass the exams."
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   That's what I mean.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   These guys and gals are experts in the field, and their experience is what makes you an
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.120]   expert in the field.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.080]   Another reviewer said, "Best website to study IT and cybersecurity-related courses."
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   I like the part where they make a few courses free for the weekend.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.600]   They're doing it again in September.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.480]   A Microsoft free weekend, September 17th and 18th.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.680]   Make sure you check that out.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.320]   Lots of classes, all weekend free.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.000]   Great way to dip your toe in to see what IT Pro TV is all about.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.840]   There's also a free live webinar, All Things Cyber Security.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   They've done this before.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.320]   It's really good with Daniel Lowry and John Strand.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.960]   It'll be Thursday, September 15th.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.680]   If you want to be there live, which I recommend, because you can ask questions, it's 2PM Eastern
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.080]   on the 15th, 2PM Eastern on the 15th.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.120]   Of course, if you can't be there live, maybe you work or something, they have that on the
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   man later.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   It's nice if you could be there live to ask your questions.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   Don't forget, IT Pro TV has training for your IT team as well.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.040]   A great enterprise plan, the IT Pro TV business plan.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   Bottom line.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040]   You're going to get a free live webinar.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Thank you, IT Pro TV.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:40.040]   Good friends of this network since they started almost ten years ago now.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   IT Pro TV.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   All right.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   Back to the Apple event.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   We're talking -- oh, I'm jumping all over the place, which is unfortunate.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   We like the dynamic island.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   We're done with that.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   We'll see how it works in practice.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   I think that you didn't expect.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.040]   It's all is rumored, yes.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   I don't think there was a lot of talk about the -- the -- the -- I mean, how the bidding was
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   going to work, but I think that it looks very promising.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.040]   I was just -- just one last thing before we move off of that, though.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   I was looking at the -- they post the pictures during the keynote, and also they have the
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   little sidebar with the image details.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   And I was pleased to see that when you're shooting still videos in RAW, you have the option of
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   saving it as pre-bin 48 megapixel image files.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   That's -- let's -- let's -- let's -- let's see what comes off that sensor.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   Apple calls that -- Apple calls that Pro RAW.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   Pro RAW, sorry.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   And I presume that that's compressed RAW.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   I can't be uncompressed.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.040]   It'd be too big.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   It could be uncompressed RAW.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   I mean, it's not that big compared to video.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   Maybe I didn't get enough -- recording the storage, then.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   It's -- I only got 256.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   But I mean, it's not -- I mean, compared to ProRes video that it's potentially recording,
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   it was not saving a RAW 48 megapixel image is not going to be that big of a deal.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   I guess you're right.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.040]   But the --
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   It'll be 48 megabytes, right, roughly.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   But it --
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   But a 48 megapixel on that chip size, I don't have -- we'll see how it turns out.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   I'm not super optimistic about the quality of the RAW image.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   I'm really excited about the quality of the 12 megapixel image.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   Because of the binning and all that.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   Although, it'll be interesting because they may put post-processing capabilities into photos,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.680]   for instance, that understand ProRaw and does some of the same computational magic that they
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.040]   do in real time.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   And if you can do it without having to do it in real time, you might do it better, right?
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   It's possible.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:40.200]   And another factor is that Adobe is working on the -- what they're promoting is almost
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.880]   like the camera app of all camera apps.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:49.040]   The czar of computational photography, who originally was with Adobe, was steering Google's
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.080]   computational photographer, well, now is back at Adobe.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.600]   He's leading a team to develop an app that will bring computational photography, hopefully,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.200]   to the next level.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.360]   And with not just, "Hey, look, we balanced the exposure," but, "Hey, look, we noticed
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.760]   that you can't see the moon because it's washed out because your sensor can't do it.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.960]   Would you like us to calculate what the moon should look like and stick it in the sky for
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.040]   you with that kind of stuff?"
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.680]   And so for that kind of stuff, that makes it much more interesting when a developer like
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.800]   that can get access to the full 48 megapixels.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.880]   I agree with Alex.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.680]   I've always thought, "Oh, I wouldn't be great to have RAW on my camera phones."
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   Then I look at the RAW image like, "Yeah, you know what?
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.640]   I think I'll dump the JPEG into Photoshop because it's so much nicer looking."
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   But, yeah.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.800]   But the highlight, folks, I'm sure, they're licking their chops.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.480]   Adobe is with their Photoshop camera.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.760]   I mean, yeah, this could be very interesting.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:45.600]   And from a regular person perspective, having the 48 -- a little bit like how you've got
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.160]   the out-forage in pixels so you can do image stabilization.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.960]   One of the things that they're doing that I think is clever is essentially adding a
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:41:00.200]   fourth camera by doing a 12 megapixel crop at the center of the 48 megapixel sensor.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   And as Alex said, you know, we'll see because then they're not able to do binning.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:09.280]   But last week, I heard a bunch of people were like, "Oh, it's just a digital zoom."
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.080]   It's like, it's not because they're not inventing pixels.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.040]   What they're doing is they're using the 12 megapixels in the center and you frame it
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.440]   based on that and it doesn't bin it and you get a 12 megapixel image from 12 megapixels
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.440]   worth of sensor.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.160]   Now, we'll see what the quality is there.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.620]   But one of the challenges with all these cell phones is, you know, having different zooms
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.680]   when you can't actually move the lens.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:38.080]   And so this essentially gives that iPhone Pro a fourth camera, which is the zoomed to,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.040]   you know, the crop -- sorry, I said zoomed -- crop of the center 12 megapixels of the
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   image.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:51.680]   So 5 a.m. this past Friday, I set my alarm 10 minutes early.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.720]   I probably should have just set it for two minutes early because the store didn't open
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.360]   to what about 506 for us.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.520]   Now people in the discord are saying it was smooth on the east coast.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.040]   So maybe this was regional.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.120]   And mine was smooth too.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.840]   I think it really it's the luck of a draw when it comes to the CDN.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.120]   Which server you get, yeah.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.000]   I had preset my order and I did have to quit the app and I use the Apple app.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.760]   I quit and reloaded it a couple of times and then it popped in and I, you know, pressed
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.160]   two buttons and we were done.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.920]   I guess it's which server you were you got a cue.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   Because I was there refreshing.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   Did it on the app on my iPad and my phone.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.680]   Did not try to do it on the web.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.960]   I had, as you did, I had set up the pre-order, all the -- even the payment information, everything.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.760]   It said, "Oh, you've got two pre-orders.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   You want to do it?"
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.160]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.400]   And then it just went into a loop and I wasn't sure if it took the first one.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.880]   That's happened to me in the past.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.320]   And then I checked my orders and it didn't have it.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.760]   So I thought, "Oh, I guess it failed.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.600]   I tried my order because that was Lisa's phone, tried my order, never got it."
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.280]   I said, "Screw this, went to bed.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   Got up at 8.30."
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.000]   Checked the Lisa's order had gone through.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.400]   It just took, I guess, a while to get into the order page.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.680]   I had not, but I was able to, with careful finagling of the settings, I am going to
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:18.960]   be picking up a golden iPhone with 256 on Friday and Cora Madeira.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.760]   I'll wave as I pass by, Jason.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   That was 16th.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760]   On the 16th.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   Yeah, on the 16th.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.920]   It was the only way that I could get it, you know, day of day of day of.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   I did the same thing.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.920]   So maybe we'll be there.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   What time?
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   Oh, it's 3.30 p.m.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.920]   I'm earlier than you.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   I saw mine.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   But you're doing the same thing.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   You're still a good one.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.160]   It was going to be 28th, I think, if I had it mailed to me.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.720]   And then it slipped to October pretty quickly.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   So it's actually a step up.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.720]   It's still a multi-store.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.320]   It's always the trick there.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.400]   Yeah, the other funny thing that happened to a lot of people, and I noticed this because
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.840]   I tried to do a second order a little bit later, is that the Apple Card processing kind
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.640]   of went down as well.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.800]   But maybe that's what happened.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   Because that's what I was using.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.120]   Because I'm buying Apple hardware and using the Apple Card.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.360]   So even if Apple system works, if Goldman Sachs's system is overwhelmed because it's
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.960]   a huge spike of charges at that one time.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.440]   And so, yeah, I tried to do an Apple Pay on Apple Card on the second transaction.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.760]   And that one didn't go through.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   The first one did.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   Okay.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   Yes, it was Apple Pay.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.240]   I did just on a off chance, went to T-Mobile.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.760]   And they said, "You can't order anything now.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   What are you crazy?"
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.360]   So I just went to sleep.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.320]   Anyway, the watch was easy.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.960]   I ordered it, as you know, Andy.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.560]   It's a little distracted during the event.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.600]   As soon as the stir opened at the end of the event, I immediately ordered an Ultra.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.880]   Because I will be scuba diving, skydiving, climbing Everest, you know, all that stuff.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.600]   I can't wait to bring it to 100 meters.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.760]   I'm just going to be walking near doorknobs as usual.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.720]   And so that's why I think I'll save money just by having this thing where the titanium
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.000]   edge of the case actually goes above the Sapphire crystal.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.600]   So yeah, that's what I feel like I feel like I need to do.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.760]   That's the extreme sports that I've been to.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.840]   I feel like that now that I ordered the Ultra, I kind of felt like I need to go out and buy
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   a Jeep Rubicon.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   Yes, exactly.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.840]   With a snorkel.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   With a snorkel.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   Yeah, with snorkel.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   I can say that snorkel.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   That had that snorkel.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.000]   You know, with the extra large tires.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.560]   Because you might be going underwater anytime crossing that big wide muddy river.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.560]   I mean, fibulous build out.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   Yeah, a little wind.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   I'm ready.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.880]   Anyway, the watch comes the 23rd.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.720]   If you were lucky, Jason.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   So what did you you were able to order for the 16th, I guess?
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.360]   Yeah, this is so my son is going away to college.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.480]   And so he gets the he gets his first non hand me down iPhone.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   So he got the special dad.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.720]   Yeah, that's a that's the thing we did for my daughter.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   And so we're doing for him.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.320]   So he got the base model, the 128th story just going to be plenty for him.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   His current iPhone.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.920]   He's got he's got a hand me down iPhone 10.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.520]   So he's going to have a good upgrade to the base model in midnight.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520]   He chose.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.880]   And we got him a blue silicone case for it that he also chose.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.520]   And I hope he enjoys it.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.760]   But yeah, that's that's your coming of age moment here is like we're going to send you
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.480]   off to school with a new iPhone.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:13.240]   Jason, it's it's I know it's IP 68, but is that tested against a father's discrete
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   tears?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:21.880]   I yes, my my iPhone mini that I'll be bringing with you to to college will.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.640]   Be water resistant to my tears.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.160]   I don't know how you know about that, Andy, but it is really.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.600]   Oh, no, it is just a student of humanity.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   It's a tear.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   I must do it.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   I've I've observed this from the benches.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   I have I have had I have had those realization that she why why is Sheila like calling calling
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.880]   me and like texting girls?
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.600]   Oh, she just sent her first kid off the college and she she's feeling a lot of things.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.600]   It is.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   There's a lot of fields there.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.200]   This is your first right going to college.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   Jason.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   Oh, this is my last.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.000]   Well, that's actually two weeks from now.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.600]   This is the empty nest.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   Yes, indeed.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.400]   Now you just wait for the dog to die and life begins.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.920]   Dog died a couple weeks ago.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.480]   So there's nothing left in the house.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   Perfect timing.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   That's cool.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   That's cool.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   But it is empty house.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   Yeah, it's it's an interesting adjustment.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.120]   I have to say I have pictures of one of your kids as a baby floating in a floating in
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.800]   Hawaii in a whole in Hawaiian warm waters on on your wife's.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.200]   She's about to turn 21 and is a senior in college Andy.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   Wow.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.600]   Hey, I'm sorry about your dog Jason.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   Sorry.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   I apologize.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.200]   Yeah, no, I mean, no, you're right.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   You nailed it.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.000]   We're like, oh my God, what is the universe doing to us?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.800]   Because the kids are both going to be out of the house and the dog died.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   So there's literally I mean, we have cats, but that are not the same.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   No cats are the same.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   They're just there to suck you.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.000]   Comfort time to get a spritter van.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.500]   Yes.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.200]   See the world.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.800]   Okay, so good.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.400]   And Andy, do you decide not to order?
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   I can't remember.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.400]   Did you?
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.200]   I'm not I've I don't know if I'm going to get a loaner.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.520]   If I order one, I want to be I want to do the thing where I can take it back if I need
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.520]   to.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.080]   And on October 6th, I'm going to be in New York City, which is a time where not only
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.880]   am I going to be at like the Google's Google's pixel event, I'm also going to be seeing
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.360]   two operas and that's also the weekend of New York Comic Con.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.080]   So I think that if I'm going to try to engineer it so that the two week return window happens
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:23.240]   within that weekend because I have a feeling that cosplay photos and opera photos from
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.080]   the cheap seats and and and pictures of Sundar Pichai, I think would be interesting things
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   to test.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   I will confess.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.560]   I will confess I pretended I'm getting it for the radio show, but really I'm getting it
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.360]   because September 23rd, the most most of the most of the companies going to see Roger
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   Waters.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.960]   And I love to try out these phones in the concert photos.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.880]   That's a great way to play with them.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   You have a live fire exercise.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.880]   It is a live fire exercise.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.520]   That's one of the things that made the made COVID lockdown so difficult.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.240]   It's like I can't go to the library.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.560]   I can't go to a sporting event.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.720]   I can't go to the places where I mean whoever I'm in lockdown with congratulations, you
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.600]   have a featured role in my product review this week.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.680]   And to camera test this week.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   Well, there's so much to talk about.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.120]   What do we think of the ultra?
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:18.160]   This was pretty much as rumored by the time the rumor mill was done.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.160]   Did you order one Jason?
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.480]   Are you going to stick with a regular old Apple watch?
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.240]   I'm going to stick to the regular old Apple watch, but I could see the appeal and I definitely
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.520]   talk to friends who like the style of it.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   I mean, it is.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   It's what you want to be.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   Right?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.960]   Like the G-Shock style Apple watch.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.680]   And the fact that they embraced the sports nature of it and didn't just make it a larger
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.840]   size Apple watch that it really is different.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   It looks different.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.080]   I appreciate that they did that.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.280]   It will still be aspirational to a lot of people.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.040]   Just like I think we said last week, some people buy a big four by four Jeep and they
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.320]   live in the suburbs and they never go off-roading, but they like how it looks and like there
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   will be those people, but make no mistake, this is a four by four off-road Apple watch.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.720]   I actually got the.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.160]   It's such an idiot.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.960]   The band that you can stretch to fit over your wetsuit as if.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   That's going to happen.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.720]   Well, look, if you honestly, maybe over my jammies, but if you have the most expensive
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.680]   watch, Apple watch, you want to put it like above over your winter coat so people can
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   see it.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   That's right.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:30.440]   I say without sarcasm that this I think is like the Omega Speedmaster of Apple watches
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:37.120]   where there are so many people who actually buy these like $6,000, $20,000 watches actually
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.840]   use the Chrono Ref features of it.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   They buy it because they like the engineering of it.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.240]   They like the styling of it.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.200]   And to a certain extent, they also like, hey, look, I'm a fancy adult who can afford like
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.760]   really fancy grown-up watches, even if it does look like a couple of like Oreo cookies
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   on my wrist.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   It's a big thing.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.560]   So yeah, I think a lot of people going to want to have it to show it off.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.920]   I have to say that in a world in which it doesn't matter as democratic as the Apple
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.880]   Watch design has always been where no matter how much money you spend on it, it's still
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.560]   that same rectangular pillowcase that everybody has had since version zero.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.320]   Like now we have a visual distinction of here.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.920]   No, I don't have I don't have like the $250 SE edition.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.600]   I have like the really fancy sports watch because I am that special in that particular
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   Alex.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   Did you get the ultra?
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   Yes, Alex.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.520]   I did.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.640]   So I mean, I'm hoping I really like the more real estate.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.800]   I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   Yeah, me too.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.360]   And the brighter screen, I thought that night mode was very interesting.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:40.000]   You could just twirl the knob and it goes to red, which is good for not merely for diving,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.160]   but for production production.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   Production, exactly.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   So there was enough there.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.560]   It's not like, you know, I'm not like I have, I have aspirations of diving.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.720]   I haven't dived for a long time.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.520]   So yeah, I love scuba dive, but not, but I love scuba diving.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.800]   I'm not certified, but I've done it a couple of times.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.760]   And it's made, I did on the Great Barrier Reef, which is a, you know, check.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.280]   So it's on the list of things that I want to get back to, but I haven't done it for
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   a long time.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.800]   And I'm afraid if I wear that watch, I will say master, we'll say, ah, you're all right.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   Go on in.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   Yeah, I did.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   I did.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.160]   We did talk a lot in office hours about the fact that that little company who makes is
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   making the customization for the dive calculator.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.520]   I was like, wow, do they just step into a big?
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.200]   They don't have no idea.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.400]   Well, but I mean, it's just so much money.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.940]   Like they just, they, you know, they probably, this is a little, it's a little, they do
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.440]   see it's not even a, it's not even a publicly traded company.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.360]   But they do do that kind of software already.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   So they're the best.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.000]   This is, this is like, they've been working this way.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.480]   They've been having this little vertical and weish or super.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.960]   Who is who is feeling the spirit for adventure.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.600]   They're obviously passionate about what they do.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   And it's, I love that.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.920]   I love the fact that this little company that relatively to all these other companies have
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.160]   been, has been doing this for a very long time.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.400]   They're passionate about what they do and Apple just tap them and it's like, like just
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.800]   pure gold, you know, like.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.080]   And so I think it's smart though.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:10.400]   It's, Apple's really saying this is we're, we understand extreme sports and we are, we
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:17.240]   listened and we're made something that is right for a variety of people and $200 less
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.280]   than the equivalent Garmin.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.760]   But that was the only surprise that Mark Gurman was speculating to be a thousand bucks.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.800]   It was only 800 only.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.200]   And, and it's, I mean, there is, my understanding is there's no equivalent Garmin, right?
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.520]   Like the Garmin things have much longer battery life.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.240]   They have a lot of things going for it.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.560]   This is Apple kind of coming in right below them and saying, do you really need to get
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.280]   a Garmin and, and, and we'll see where they go from here.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.200]   And if they add other features over the next few years to this line to, in order to kind
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   of eat it up that low end of the Garmin market.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.240]   Like I, I don't think Apple wants to get that super narrow high end adventure watch market.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.880]   I think they want the kind of broad swath of people who feel event, adventure enough that
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.880]   they want that Garmin watch.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.160]   And then they look at Apple and they're like, Oh, okay.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.120]   I can get an Apple watch to do this.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.800]   And that's, that's, I think what they're going for.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.760]   This is going to be one of the most interesting review cycles.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.640]   I think of any product that I can think of that it's going to take in the next three
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:13.000]   or four months, we're going to see the actual people for which this, this watch was designed
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.320]   really treat it like the, the, with the sort of tacit was designed for.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.440]   So when you're training for a marathon, not simply to complete it or not simply say, Hey,
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.360]   this might be the year I break four hours, but to say I'm, I'm training for this marathon
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:29.560]   because I want to qualify for the Olympics or I want to qualify for the Boston Marathon.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.320]   Or when you're, when you're really are going to be out there for like three, four, five,
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   six, seven days rock and rolling over the rocks.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.400]   These are the people that are really going to tell us whether they've actually met the
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   standard.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.040]   Like there are also people who will buy it and end up going a little farther with their
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.360]   fitness and with their sports.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.800]   They might like, Hey, I got the watch.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.280]   I should really try some of this stuff.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.960]   Maybe there's something, there's something about a watch where you once you have the,
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.400]   once you have that faith that there is nothing I can do to destroy this.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   And my, my wrist is not as strong as this watch.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.680]   So I can go forward.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.600]   Like I, I've mentioned that a couple times.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   We're not sure about this.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.040]   You'll break your wrist before you break our watch.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   I'm not sure about anything.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.440]   No, but, but I'm, but I'm saying that there's, this is, this is, this is why I have a, I,
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.160]   I have a Casio G shock and it's been one of my favorite watches for 12 years because
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.080]   if I'm going to, if I'm going to spend like a two or three days and I know that maybe
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.560]   I'm going to be at the beach, maybe I'm going to be in saltwater.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:31.000]   I know that the box that this camera or this watch or this, whatever Cayman says it can
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.440]   be immersed in saltwater for a small amount of time.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.320]   But I know that the G shock will absolutely do it.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.040]   And once you get to the, once you get to the point where there's some scratches and
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.320]   there's some scuffs and this Apple Watch Ultra has been through some stuff and now you trust
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.240]   it to absolutely work for you no matter what you put it through, that's going to be quite
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240]   an achievement for Apple.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:54.720]   Now I do have to point out a Hartley Charlton writing for a Mac rumors points out that the
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.360]   chip in the new watches, including the Ultra is the same chip that was in the S six or
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.840]   the, the last two generations of Apple watches, the S six, S seven chips.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.520]   I don't think we're pushing the watch that hard.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.160]   It's not like we're recording video on it.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.760]   So it does, I don't know if it's necessary.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.560]   Same T eight, three, oh one identifiers, a CPU and the S seven and S six chips.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.840]   I mean, we're going, they haven't updated the chips since the series six.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.000]   Well, the processing is right because the package has a packages, other features and
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   stuff.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.840]   And I think that the other thing is, is that the, you know, this is version one and what
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.280]   I'm really interested to see is version two or three when exactly what Andy said when
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.120]   they, when people start going out and giving Apple feedback, you know, this is just the
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120]   beginning.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.280]   You know, and so it's, and I, you know, and I think that part of this comes from Cook's
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   personality.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   I mean, he's really into exercise.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.520]   He's really into fitness.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.400]   He's really into a lot of those things.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.080]   And so this is probably, you know, got a little bit more juice than a lot of other ideas
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.280]   and an apple.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.440]   So let's comment around Mac rumors says, sometimes when I'm swimming in the ocean, I pause to
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   run geek bench.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.920]   That's probably, that's probably a good point.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.000]   Carlton says one explanation for Apple not advancing the CPU technology is that even
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.800]   if they use the new A14 or 15 or 16 cores with the five or four nanometer process, all
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.320]   you'd get is performance improvements and you don't need it.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   You don't need it.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.400]   I mean, they're probably looking at CPU utilization, you know, and just going, well,
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.080]   it's not really, you know, it's 32 gigs of storage.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:27.880]   That's why you're not getting more storage in these new watches, but 32 gigs is a lot
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.280]   for a device on your wrist.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.880]   I think, I think that, I think the one comes to upgrading the CPU.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   It's a lot of the CPU's in their watches.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.680]   All they care about is extending battery life.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Right.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   That's performance wise until they put a, no, I'm going to correct myself before you even
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   say it.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.880]   I don't see anything that they could add to it at this point outside of satellite communication.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.000]   That is going to be beyond the capability of the current CPU.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   So the iPhone, the iPhone, the iPhone CPUs are the same way where there, I like to say
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.880]   they're suspiciously overpowered for what they're being asked to do.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:06.440]   People did a very savvy politically, I think, thing by focusing, they have one new feature
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.840]   in the new watch, which is temperature.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.880]   But they didn't, they only focused it on cycle tracking, ovulation, retroactive ovulation
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.800]   prediction, things like that.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.200]   And so they really focused on, it's features for women.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.360]   And I think that was actually very smart.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:29.600]   In fact, it was almost the first long segment in the whole event.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.200]   And they're very savvy.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.880]   I think this is, this is really smart of Apple at this time to say, look, don't use those
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.080]   period tracking acts.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.120]   We know they're not private.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   We've got a watch.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.400]   This is going to do it for you.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.680]   In fact, it's going to do so much more.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.040]   Very, very savvy, politically, I think savvy of Apple.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   I believe that they actually spent more time talking about the privacy related to that
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.920]   feature, the technology behind it.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.400]   Which is absolutely no accident.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.760]   It's actually very, very important.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.920]   And it also leverages something that's signature with Apple.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.000]   You can, as much as you can trust any huge company, you can trust Apple when it comes
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   to my, if Apple, Apple themselves are going to try to make sure that they themselves cannot
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.640]   see your data unless they absolutely, positively need to see it.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:21.720]   So when, wasn't it a Mozilla that did an audit of period tracking apps and found that
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:29.960]   25 only, of 25, 18 of them had such vague privacy, privacy promises within their terms
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:35.160]   of agreement that it was a very much open question about, can they see your data?
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   Yes.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.400]   Would they simply hand it over to any interested law enforcement personality who simply asked
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   for it?
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.360]   Maybe you can't trust people with that information.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.800]   David Shaub in our IRC says, cook likes health like jobs liked music.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.240]   I think that's actually very apt.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.040]   Very, very correct.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.200]   I think, I think that's true.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.160]   I think it is a passion of, of Tim Cook.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.520]   And I think that it's a good match for the Apple watch, right?
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.920]   I think it's interesting this, this temperature sensor on one level, I agree completely.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.680]   I think the way that they did it, they talked about cycle tracking and they talked about
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   privacy.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680]   I thought that was really good.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   I do.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:14.640]   I mean, part of me wonders if this, if they realize that temperature sensor was something
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.160]   they could do on the watch.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.400]   And then it was a matter of trying to find out what could they actually tell with the
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400]   temperature sensor.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.040]   I heard from somebody, I know we've been speculating about like, do you have a fever
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   or something like that?
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:31.080]   I heard from a doctor who said the weird thing about it is, when you get a fever, your temperature
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.160]   is concentrated on your core and your extremities get colder.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.280]   So it actually would be bad for that.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   Interesting.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.960]   I do wonder if part of this was Apple kind of hunting for what the right use of that sensor
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.480]   might be since it's a sensor they could build in.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.400]   And I think it's also interesting that the biology gets in the way too, in that they
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.760]   have to do this tracking overnight because they can't get a reliable signal during the
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.280]   day in terms of because it's too inconsistent.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.440]   So you have to wear the watch overnight in order to do the cycle tracking.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.680]   And even so, they have to have two sensors, one at the top exposed to the air, bottom exposed
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   to the skin.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.200]   It's really for something you think was so simple.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.280]   I mean for glucose reading, you think is okay, well that's going to be the moonshot feature,
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.240]   even just getting a relevant feature for temperature sensing.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.480]   That is actually not moonshot, but it's at least like Gemini around rendezvous in orbit
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.000]   in terms of a achievement.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.120]   Well, I'm just glad I got the ocean band that will fit over my jammies.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120]   That's all.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   There you go.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   And your spacesuit.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120]   Bit of a bit wetter on your sports jacket.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.840]   I mean, you know, it starts right over the dot.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   It's white.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.160]   So when you wear a gray one, it just pops out like, hey, I got it.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.720]   You can, actually the other good thing is you can use some of sock garters just by a second
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   one.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   Hey, good news.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.160]   There was a rumor that the bands would not fit for the new watches.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.560]   We're not fit the old watches.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560]   That's not true.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.680]   Still, still the same size.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   So that's good news.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.320]   I think that's really good of Apple to do that.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.880]   They could have made them something that you had by all new bands.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.440]   And that would have been a little cynical, but I didn't do that.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.120]   You had all of the all of the punditry about Apple trying to suck money out of you for
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   everything.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.760]   And like, there's you got to have a new case for the new iPhone.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.640]   It isn't compatible with the old case.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.120]   And like they don't care.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.320]   Look, if they wanted to suck money out of people with the Apple Watch bands, they could
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.120]   have done that so easily.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.680]   And we are we are eight years into the Apple Watch era, seven and a half years into the
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.680]   Apple Watch era.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.760]   And they still haven't broken band compatibility.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:40.320]   So I got to say like it could not they don't they don't make you pay up for every accessory
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.400]   at every turn.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.080]   I think there's a lot of restraint happening with Apple Watch bands.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.680]   But you point out in your article, which was very good, six colors.com, underestimating
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.600]   Apple's bull moves.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.280]   You parallel Ben Thompson, who also pointed out that Apple's focus these days is our
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:02.120]   poo average revenue per user and increasing the use of Apple's services.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   And ancillary products like watches and AirPods that that's where the money comes.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.600]   Yeah, Ben sort of backtracked on that today, which I thought was funny.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.720]   But I think I think just sort of I think the point is if Apple was all in on services.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.040]   I've been quoting them all weekend.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   Gosh darn you, Ben.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   Oh, you got to watch.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.640]   Well, he said if they were all in, they could have cut prices, right?
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   And they didn't do that.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.800]   And I think that that's true.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.000]   But it does point out something where if all that Apple cared about was making money on
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.600]   hardware, they probably would have raised prices in the US on these models and they
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   didn't.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   They did.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.400]   They did overseas because foreign exchange is a problem for them.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.720]   The dollar is very strong.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.520]   But in the US, they held the line when I think almost everybody, we, I think we underestimated
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]   Apple, right?
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.800]   We thought, Oh, well, they're going to raise prices.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.400]   That's what they're going to do with their inflation.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.720]   They can make some money out of this.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.200]   And they didn't do that.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.240]   And Ben's argument, which I found pretty solid is when you're trying to increase your install
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:01.560]   base and get revenue per user up, erecting barriers so people aren't able to buy iPhones
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.920]   is not what you want to do.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.400]   And they already make a pretty good profit on their iPhones.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.280]   They don't actually need to go that step.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   And they didn't.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   And again, like they could have.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.360]   They could have very easily bumped up the pros by 50 or $100.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.800]   And they, they very specifically didn't do that at least in the US.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.040]   I think there's a very strong story going along with this cycle tracking.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.400]   There's a very strong story that Apple is now making, not just on privacy, but on health
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.320]   and not just on health.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.560]   But I'm going to, but there's a little subtlety here protecting you, taking care of you.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.680]   You know, you save your life.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.680]   You're in the good hands.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.920]   Well, there's the crash detection.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.440]   They really kicked it up a notch with the, well, not just I'm talking about the, just the,
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.920]   the video for that picked off the apple.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   At the beginning.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.880]   That wasn't just like a, a, a tender uplifting story about how someone, Hey, I didn't know
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.240]   I had this heart bra but now I did it. I don't get to cook I know Apples saves lives now
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.960]   It's like that was like nice dude, I'm sorry
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:03.520]   I thought I bought an Apple watch for my kid because you know, I love him and I don't want him to die. But hey
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.880]   Not everyone loves that kids
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.960]   From my perspective, I was like that's not a bunch of news clippings. I mean that was a full-on like Avengers level like
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:24.120]   They're playing crash. Yeah, that was the thing actually I didn't like which was they put people in the scenes of their
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.520]   Yeah, they made the girl who was in a plane crash sit in a set of a broken string ring
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.240]   I think that's awful to be honest. That was that was a bit much
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.620]   But you're you're right about the larger point which is that and this is a line that is difficult for them to walk
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:45.160]   Because they want they this is the message which is like we'll save your life and we're essential in that way
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.500]   I am so don't want to die or they don't want to go right
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.620]   They don't want to go a little you know too far
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.180]   But it is it is an important point right like the whole argument about the crash detection
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.260]   Which is in the phone and the watch they emphasized it for the watch, but it's in the phone as well
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.660]   They built in sensors. So if you get in a car crash
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:05.260]   It detects it and it can call for help and the satellite communication thing on the iPhone
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.380]   Which I think is gonna be a big deal the idea that you know that if you bring your iPhone with you
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.260]   There will be and if you're Apple, you know, you can take a
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.880]   Little bit lighter hand here because you know that over the next year
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.320]   They're just gonna be new stories that make the point for you, right?
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:24.440]   Because I guarantee you sometime this winter somebody's gonna get lost on a snowy road somewhere
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.440]   And they're gonna be able to call for help with the satellite call for help feature and
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:34.080]   Everybody's gonna say oh the iPhone said somebody's gonna fall in a trash compact or wearing a pixel 6 watch
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.500]   Yeah, and it ain't gonna end so good. No not for the watcher the person. Yeah, I'm sorry
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   We shouldn't make look it that was a little
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.420]   Yeah, that was I fell into the garbage truck, but thank God I was wearing my Apple watch
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.220]   Wow
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.160]   Hate to sound I hate to sound like I'm this much of a nerd
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.140]   But I was thinking that but isn't it like a steel container? How did the signal get?
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:03.480]   Maybe his hand was sticking out. I don't know the Apple watch stopped the compact. I
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.440]   Bluetooth
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.840]   The Bluetooth got just far enough to get to his iPhone clever
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.100]   You know I I do feel like they're milking in a little too much like the first time I saw I was like wow
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.800]   That's really good and the second time I saw it. I was like, okay, okay, then this one I was like
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   Like too much too much so hopefully they'll they'll back they'll back away from that
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.780]   Yeah, but but but I don't think it's a message that will get out
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.040]   See remember not you know a small percentage of Apple fans watches the event
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:40.360]   What they're just as much interested in is the ripples that extend from the event via journalists and by you know early adopters telling their friends and stuff
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:46.840]   And I think it's a very clear signal. You know you're in good hands with Apple is yes
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.520]   I think a very interesting just wait until they until they buy farmer insurance exactly
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:58.000]   Yeah, yeah, Jay Jonah Jameson all state Jay Jonah Janssen doing commercials for Apple. I'm looking forward to it
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.120]   But yeah, I've I've said this before so I will just say this very very briefly it once again
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:09.120]   Makes me wish that why doesn't Apple allow people who do not have iPhones to use the Apple watch
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.160]   I know it's because they want walk in they want they want it to sell iPhones
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:18.720]   But the more they hammer this point of look how many lives we're saving look how many this is we we see we see health
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.960]   There's almost as almost a holy holy thing for us. It's like yeah, but yeah
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.240]   I've I own an iPad. I own a MacBook. Why can't I?
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.480]   Why can't I configure an Apple watch with one of those Apple devices instead?
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.720]   Why not why not make it work with Android as well?
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.320]   I'm absolutely clean market
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.800]   There might be a little a little crack in the damn there Andy and it was a subtle announcement that they made
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:45.400]   But I think it's interesting which is they announced that Apple fitness plus previously a watch only feature
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.000]   Will not be watch only you'll be able to do it on an iPhone
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.280]   Coming this fall and I I wonder if if it's a sign that they may
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.400]   Loosen up
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.200]   I mean it may still be in their ecosystem
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.520]   But that they may loosen it up a little bit because you're absolutely right if you've got a Mac or especially if you've gotten the iPad
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.160]   There is no reason you shouldn't be able to use an Apple watch right like the watch can literally
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.720]   Know it's a well. It's an app
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.160]   But if you've got an iPad you can run that same app and talk to it sure sure you can so you know
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160]   It's not like the first generation model
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:24.680]   It's not like the first generation Apple watches where it was pretty much just a two-way terminal that connected to
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.840]   Processing that was happening on your own it really is an independent device right now
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.640]   So yeah, I understand I understand all the business reasons for them not to do it
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.480]   I just think that it's a shame that they don't that they don't that they don't have that same iPad
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.720]   iPod moment where they said if we make this if we make this Mac exclusive will have a reason for me
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.440]   Reason to buy max if we make that if we make this windows compatible
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.400]   Then we'll have then we'll have reason for the entire world to buy iPhones from us
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.360]   And we'd rather take the money from everything I think I tunes on them on
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.560]   Windows maybe why they don't do it very often it was a disaster like it was a complete this it was considered
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.640]   I mean a
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.800]   Disaster technologically and it was a huge mess and I don't think anyone wants to go back there
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.240]   I don't think it's a different totally different world now
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:11.000]   Yeah, you can't do it out of it though like why not let iPad users use it
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.560]   That's the I think that's the thing is that right now you literally can't use it unless you're a parent who buys an
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:21.240]   SCE cellular SE for your kid right but other than that and that is still set up inside an iPhone
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.960]   But if you could expand it just out a little bit so that somebody who doesn't have an iPhone
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   But has an iPad or a Mac could use it
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.520]   And Andy's exactly right it used to be just a mirror of the iPhone
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.040]   But right now it's a much more standalone kind of product
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.600]   You can you can walk outside away from your iPad and still use it and and have it be useful
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.200]   Especially if it's the cellular model that would be a nice can you see but answers plus change is a big deal
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.480]   I agree question that was we had on the ray of show we couldn't really quite figure it out
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.440]   Can you make and receive phone calls on a cellular equipped iPhone without the phone?
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.760]   I mean Apple watch without the phone present. Absolutely. I do that all the time
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:06.120]   I go running I go running and all I have are my AirPods and my Apple watch
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:12.440]   Okay, and I can stream audio I can answer calls I can make calls make calls as a question
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   You can yeah
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.280]   You can make calls with Siri or you can open the phone app and actually type in the number any how is it doing?
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.200]   It is it silly is it connecting back to your phone? No, it has its own
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.920]   Cellular Apple watch has its own cellular ID you add it to your cell phone plan you pay ten or fifteen dollars
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.360]   And right for that right and then what they do is they've got a there's a feature that the carriers have that basically is a line share
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.880]   So your calls go to both phone numbers
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.040]   So your watch has a phone number that nobody sees
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.680]   But that means that if your phone rings your watch also rings
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.640]   So if you leave your phone at home and you're running with your watch and somebody calls you on your phone your watch also rings
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.360]   You're absolutely your answer it. We're super. There's really no technical reason for Apple not to make your iPad
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:03.160]   Be sufficient to set up an Apple watch or at least nothing big enough that it should matter right like I can see the argument of like
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.800]   Well, yeah, but it's a lot less useful. Do you think if you carry only but I think the carriers are preventing that
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.280]   No, I I think it's Apple
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.680]   I think I think it's the complexity of of a product that was built to be tied directly to an iPhone and then trying to kind of like
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.120]   Unpick all the complexity of that over time
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.280]   And I think there's a lot of people asking them to do it
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:33.920]   I think there's more there is a thing. Okay. I mean everybody has an iPhone. So I guess right that's apples attitude
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.320]   They seem to sell a lot of iPhones to people who use Windows primarily
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.040]   Yeah, you know
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:43.960]   They seem to sell a lot of even I passed to people who use Windows primarily and Windows is still not 82% of the world market
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:52.120]   Android is also the majority of mobile installations right now and that the Apple and remember that one of the one of the most brilliant things that Apple did
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.440]   And marketing to Apple watch was positioning positioning it not just as a wonderful piece of technology
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:05.200]   But as a style item and so if you have this thing on your wrist, it's like having a cultural icon a cultural touchstone on your wrist as well
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.640]   So yeah, I'm not I'm not saying that there's like apples get being flooded with the
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:17.480]   Telegrams and and and and and and Instagrams asking from Android people saying please please please we have money for you
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.120]   We would love to buy an Apple watch, but I do think that if they made the announcement that we are
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:30.400]   Android world we are taking pity upon you. We know that you're we know that you're smartwatch your smartwatch world absolutely sucks
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.640]   We are now going to own that market by simply allowing you to buy an apple
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.840]   we'll be by introducing either an
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.360]   Android Android version of the Apple watch app or just by simply saying doesn't matter
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.600]   You don't you no longer have to have an iPhone to get this thing working
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.520]   I think that they would move a lot of I think they would move a lot of a lot of Apple watches if they did
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.040]   I think I think if they I think the iPad thing makes a lot of sense
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.720]   I think that if they built an Android management tool for the eye the
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:03.640]   For the for the foot for the watch I think I'd be looking into the sky see if I get hunt for pork
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.920]   You know cuz if you do some pigs flying around I just don't think that I don't think they're gonna touch the
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.480]   Because that would and I have to be a lot of them in yeah, it is such a
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:19.520]   As someone who has worked on apps for the iPhone and Android the Android mark the fragmentation of the Android market
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.360]   Just makes it like it's just a lot of line mines
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.480]   So it really is for Apple they would just go well. Why would I do that like I just don't think that we'll ever see Apple
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.080]   Develop almost anything yeah, I choose for Windows was never any good
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:40.240]   Yeah, I mean and always all the Apple the Apple TV plus on the TVs is terribly underpowered
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.160]   Terrible, you know, it's just it was a horrible idea. Yeah, and it right did it
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.400]   And I think that I don't know what the truth is but I bet you they regret it because it just has been
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:56.560]   The performance has been so bad. Well, I can tell you the people who are making content for it for talk
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.120]   I other than the people I know and but not not at Apple
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.880]   I'm just saying in general the thing is is that if something's gonna break when you're streaming something or sending something out
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.040]   It's gonna be in the Apple TV
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.280]   You know on those TVs not on the TV itself is way overpowered the Apple TV plus the Apple TV is way overpowered for what it does
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.960]   the the
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.840]   televisions are way underpowered right I'm in that process dogs. Yeah, just
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.720]   And yet just as a sidebar
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:32.160]   Companies much much smaller than Apple seemed to be okay with doing that they managed to be because everyone's lying with really bad video
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.920]   They just want to be there right they just want to be there
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:42.600]   They want to be on every TV and I do that's what Apple wants. See that's the whole point. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.320]   And maybe someday you'll buy an Apple TV and have a much better experience
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.880]   But at least you can watch severance on your you know
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.560]   If you don't like it you get you get a Roku stick or something - I mean there's a lot
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.920]   There are other ways to go between what's on my TV and buying an Apple TV
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.400]   Yeah, I mean everybody lies in the TV is a giant security hole and you should never loud everybody knows
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.680]   Everybody knows at least every sophisticated user knows smart TVs are horrible
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.880]   Just all right around every in every respect. Why are they so inexpensive? Oh?
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.280]   Because they know what you they know everything you're doing
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.320]   They have microphones on them. They didn't even have cameras on them
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:28.120]   The power the power switch on my like 65 inch 4k HD TV has been like blinking white and like dot dot pause
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:34.320]   Dot dot pause to tell me that oh by the way, I can't connect to Wi-Fi. Yeah for some reason
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.440]   Yeah, and the show you're right. I should do something about that. And so I put a strip of black
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.720]   I never connected but you do have to once in a while just to update them
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:48.400]   But then you'll instantly regret it because all of a sudden new ads will show up for no reason
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   I'm here. That's why that's why that's why you you have a you have a you bring out the old version of your Apple Airport Express
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.440]   Yeah, just just for that purpose you let it you let it update itself
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.000]   And then you unplug it and never put it back in again. You change the password. Let's take a quick break
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.840]   lots more to talk about
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.680]   Lots more to talk about we're get to as much of it as we can with Jason Snell
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.160]   Mr. Alex Lindsey and the in not co our show to know today brought to you by
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.440]   Something Jason. I know you know well co-lie the KOLI
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:28.720]   D if you're a company that uses slack there is a better way to do endpoint security a much better way
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.800]   I tee it means you know
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:35.840]   I mean the traditional ways to lock it down right they often feel like they have to choose between their commitment
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.360]   To cyber security and their duty to protect their employees privacy
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.920]   And of course you have to safeguard the company data against hacks and breaches
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.480]   But do you really want to turn your shop into 1984?
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:54.360]   Traditional MDMs give the IT team complete access and control over company devices
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:02.680]   So much so that you're you're actually making your employees an enemy with collide you make them an ally
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.680]   That's a much better way to go
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.720]   Employees are inevitably going to use their work laptops for personal activities
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.560]   so now suddenly they're really concerned about privacy because
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.360]   You you know you've got surveillance capabilities you didn't want like access to photos and browser history
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:23.680]   Before you know it your end users are complaining about all the security agents slowing down their laptops
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.280]   Developers are frustrated by the lack of autonomy and here's the worst case scenario people start using their personal devices
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.920]   Just to get things done
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.200]   This is a trap the trap of top-down security, but it's not the only way
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.240]   Collide KOLI DE is an end point security solution built around honest security their philosophy is
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:55.280]   Employees aren't your biggest security risk. They're your biggest allies and your relationship with them should be based on transparency and informed consent
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.440]   Collide works by notifying your employees of security issues via slack
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.360]   It educates them on why they're important it gives them step-by-step instructions on how to resolve it themselves
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.560]   It empowers employees and it makes them allies
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:13.320]   And I love it that it's cross-platform Mac Windows and Linux
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:21.760]   The first message you're going to get is here's how to install the a collide agent on your computer and here's why we want you to install it
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:28.960]   and I have to say it addresses high-risk issues that cannot be solved through brute force or automation and
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:36.920]   Your end users can see exactly why and how every piece of data is being collected by a collides user privacy center and
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.720]   Oh, yeah, it's open source open source code base
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.800]   So there's really no fear of collide
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:51.400]   It just makes your users feel good it makes them your friends and your allies and it makes your security better and their privacy better
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:56.880]   You can meet your security goals. You really can without compromising your values KOLI DE

[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.760]   The world famous Twitter account shrimp Apple Pro
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:37.560]   Whose real name is Vietnamese Choco Taco so there I wonder if they still have Choco tacos in Vietnam
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.800]   They maybe they kept them alive there anyway. He tweeted in June
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:48.640]   The capacities the battery I want to give him credit the battery capacities for the iPhone 14 series
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.840]   Here we are now in September and
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.600]   Mac rumors is confirming
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.320]   Thanks to filings with the Chinese regulator that these those were accurate
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.440]   So big increase on the iPhone 14 and 14 plus
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:11.600]   Actually, no, that's not quite right big increase on the iPhone 14 plus as you might expect
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.880]   4,325 million at Bowers, but
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:21.480]   You might be a little saddened to see that your pro max is actually slightly smaller battery
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.720]   Interesting though Apple claims one more hour of video playback on the devices, right?
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.960]   That's chip optimization, right?
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.240]   There's a there's a there's a decoder in there
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.800]   They they do a lot of stuff like that right where they the the battery gets a little smaller
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:44.480]   But battery life gets a little longer and it's usually because they've got some optimized part somewhere in the silicon that's doing something
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.720]   You know incredibly efficiently in a way that used to take more raw CPU power
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.600]   The iPhone 14 plus features the longest battery life of any iPhone according to Apple
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.280]   Although
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.440]   Apple's tech specs say the pro max gets the longest battery life for video playback
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   Maybe that's because of that one Hertz refresh rate that they talked about you can go as low as one hertz
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.240]   That's how they're doing the always on screen. I cannot wait to get that always on screen. That's gonna be great
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   They're doing some really clever stuff too
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:22.080]   User of the beta discovered that the always on screen turns off if you if you're an Apple watch user when you leave the room
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.760]   This the screen turns itself off because realize okay if he's not in the room
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:31.320]   He's probably not gonna be looking at the screen so I may as well save some smart during the screen off so smart love that
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:38.080]   So yeah, so don't you know, I mean now we you know Apple never reveals the battery sizes, but
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.320]   Thanks to the Chinese regulator. We know how big they are, but fine. That's not really the issue
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.160]   um
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.760]   What else is going on the Apple oh
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.600]   And I this is take it, you know
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.240]   When Renee Richie was on Twitter on Sunday by the way, he was it was great to see him again
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.560]   He was he was wave tied to all you
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.760]   He said now I can tell you these rumor guys are terrible
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.840]   So why'd you tell us then
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.620]   Ming Chi Quo says don't know if he knows the
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.400]   Quo knows he's not terrible. He knows I think he's supply chain. He knows about the supply chain
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.880]   So I would trust him on supply chain things
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:24.560]   He says that initial sales of the iPhone 14 and 14 plus are disappointing not so good
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:31.120]   Well that this is this is no your pundits right no your no your sources means you quo has great supply chain sources
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:36.160]   I don't know if he has great sources for direct sales numbers that would only be
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:43.320]   Known to certain people inside Apple probably right like I'm skeptical of of of that report
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.360]   But you know you never know because it does lead to them cutting back on hardware
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.840]   Orders right if they think the sales are gonna be soft
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:57.680]   Yeah, the pro max he says doing very well as one might expect because everybody wants dynamic island, right?
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.120]   Everybody's looking for the dynamic island
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.960]   And maybe the better camera
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:11.560]   But he says the 14 now the problem with the 14 plus is you can't get it until October, right?
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.040]   That's that or later in September. I can't remember what the date was but it was pushed back a couple of
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.360]   so
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.440]   Yeah, I don't you know, yeah, I don't know
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:27.560]   Three three days after the after went on sale. I don't think that anybody outside of Apple has no the stores
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.280]   There's there's there's there and yeah
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.640]   They're analysts who have it whose job is to figure it out with a really stunning degree of precision without after
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:41.000]   After it starts moving to the cash right there exactly they have to start the other things if they have cash registers
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.840]   I don't think Apple stirs have cash registers based on the this is the quote based on the current pre-order results strong demand for the iPhone
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.800]   Pro models will likely last until the least of ever
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.440]   But suppose Apple doesn't increase iPhone Pro orders afterwards in that case potential order cut and that's where you know
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:00.120]   His supply chain stuff comes into play of the iPhone 14 and 14 plus could offset apples revenue growth. I don't know
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]   This is an analyst note, right?
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.360]   You know, I could see maybe that people my the problem is
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:15.560]   Globally we're in or you know bad inflation for everything the essentials are costing a lot more
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:22.240]   Many people are looking at the I would imagine looking at the iPhone 14 saying well my 10s is fine or my 11s fine
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.440]   Or my 12s fine. I don't need to upgrade. I would suspect many more than in previous years. So
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.600]   It's also really hard with the for with the pre-orders to like a pre the pre-order crowd is not your average
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.800]   I find buyer right like the average iPhone buyer
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.440]   Like we'll have a better idea
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.540]   I think when the quarter is over because that'll include like the holidays and all of that you'll get a better
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:46.840]   Better since when the next quarter is over
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   But like the people who are inclined to pre-order to do that thing at 5 a.m. Pacific, right?
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.480]   Like that is a very focused group and you may learn something from that
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.320]   But I feel like that that is not going to tell you the the whole story. Yeah
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:06.160]   He does I guess a survey of some kind his tweet was latest offline pre-order survey
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.080]   For iPhone 14 series in China. Oh, maybe because it's in China. They know more, right?
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.120]   They know all the total allocation for two 14 pros
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.720]   the pro models 85%
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.080]   Order allocation for the 14 plus less than 5%
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.040]   Yeah, it does make me wonder who do they make that plus four? I
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.240]   Think that's gonna be a really interesting thing to watch right not that they actually ever disclose any of this stuff
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   But when we look at it
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.240]   they they will sometimes like hint at what the mix is like and like this is their mood
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:44.280]   It's an interesting not their moonshot, but it is a gamble right which is let's make a bigger low-end phone and
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:51.120]   Will what will that do like will that sell more people on buying a new phone who might not have otherwise?
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.840]   Are you cannibalizing pro max sales?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.360]   Or it does it turn out that if somebody cares enough to get the big phone make here enough to get the pro max
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.800]   And they're just not gonna buy the plus I I don't know if anybody really knows the answer
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.160]   And this is you know, they're basically the mini didn't work out for them
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.520]   Which is sad because I love mine, but it didn't and so they're trying something else, but it's a real experiment
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.680]   Yeah, and they don't know ahead of time. I'm sure they do surveys, but they don't know I had a time what's gonna happen. Yeah
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.720]   Although it would not surprise me if the plus is a laggard
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:26.320]   If you want to save money, you're gonna you know, maybe just get the 14 and
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.600]   If you want a big screen size, you're gonna spend a little bit more and get the dynamic island
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:38.880]   It does seem like there's there's folks that everyone people that I know and it's just anecdotal or either getting the pro or they're getting one of the older versions
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   They're not getting the smaller
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.200]   The they're not buying very many of the smaller new versions
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.520]   So iPhone 16 came out yesterday
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:58.840]   I was I did I say iPhone? I'm in iOS. That's okay. We're talking about it all day. Yeah, you know what I mean a few differences
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:06.640]   There's a search button where the three dots used to be but not on my phone on the 12 only on the leases 13
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   I don't know why that is
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.040]   But you can still get to the search by sliding down
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.560]   You'll know immediately on the lock screen that you've got iOS 16 because the font has changed on the time
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.920]   That's very visible and oh, yes, if you could only see it there is a little percentage of my battery I turned that on
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.280]   Anything else Jason, I'm sure you've been using it for a while. Yeah, the whole lock screen is editable
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.080]   Right, I mean that's one of the big features and whether you've got the new iPhone pro with always on
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.880]   Locks rain the whole lock screen is edible editable now so you can change that font. There are multiple
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.840]   Time fonts you can choose from you can choose colors
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:51.760]   You can choose a bunch of different dynamic backgrounds. They're wallpaper on that thing apples got to like like
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.840]   Generators for it. Where do I find that you go on the lock screen and you tap and hold
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.920]   My mistake not in settings. Yeah, oh no wonder I didn't find that so let's go
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.120]   So you just tap and hold here and there and there you go
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.200]   Thing is and
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.720]   There's like millions of customization options in there if you add them all together oh and
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.240]   Lock screen widgets as well
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:26.160]   So now there are widgets you can place on the lock screen so you can add a glance whether again whether it's the always on or not
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.640]   Even on older phones you can set those widgets up so that you can get some
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:36.400]   App data that floats out all the way up onto your lock screen. Oh, let's add let's add the weather add the weather
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:45.040]   Set as wallpaper pair. This is like focus. There's like 8,000 settings. I don't even know what this means set as wallpaper pair
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.720]   Okay fine. Well, yeah, I don't know what
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.080]   So what it's done is it is wallpaper pair. He's got the oh, he's got a version of the thing that's on the law
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.240]   Suggesting that I have mica sergeant is my as my wallpaper. Sure. Why not?
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.400]   Yeah, you see he's got the depth effect on there where he's actually partially in front of the time and now he's oh, yeah
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   Yeah, cool. And now he's a wallpaper pair
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.960]   My wife's not gonna be happy about that
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.720]   um, whoops
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.280]   All right, so yeah, I love that look at that
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:18.240]   They picked it must have picked the photos saying I know we can put time behind his head
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:23.840]   Right well, and it's probably also picking framing, you know like it goes. Oh, that's a good frame for me to use
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.360]   I've got what I need, you know, not just that I can cut it out, but then it's the right
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.680]   And those aren't just portrait mode photos. It will analyze any photo and detect the object that's in the foreground and offer it as a cutout
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.440]   Uh, yeah, there's a lot there it is you've seriously you can spend
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.560]   A long time in the wash screen editor wish I'd seen this there's a lot you can do there
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.000]   Oh, I see so if it said it is a wallpaper pair, they don't have mica sergeant also. It's my wallpaper
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.720]   I'm a wallpaper. Oh, but it's a blurry mica. So different. Yeah, and you can turn the blur on and off like there's so many different settings that you can do
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:02.240]   For that, uh, it's a lot of fun and and like yeah, you can choose a different font and have it be blue and like have it be really like unique to you
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.440]   If you want to which is great, right? Because um, obviously this is a better feature for the always on display, right?
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.440]   That's clearly why this was created, but I think for everybody it is a fun
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:18.880]   Uh new addition to get more personal and then also to put data up on on your lock screen. Yeah, I like this. Yeah
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.760]   And that feature for isolating something from the foreground that's even built into photos now
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.400]   So that you can do that to any to any image. Yeah, it's a weird thing
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.800]   It said I have to analyze your photos before you can do this
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.840]   So it's doing some sort of background processing of my of my photos
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.480]   What you know, what you want to do is tap customize. Yeah
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:46.240]   And then uh, if you tap and you've been tapping done if you uh, if you swipe left to right now on that on that display
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.640]   You may need to add a new one. I have to
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.520]   I but you can add you can add effects
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.160]   Okay, you got it now you're in you're in done mode. So you've got you got it. Get out of done
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.200]   So this is just okay. Let's go back to my old wallpaper. Okay. Now I press and hold
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.480]   And I go to customize, but I don't press done
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:11.680]   Says customize new wallpaper. Yeah, you can't your existing one is sort of locked the way it is
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.640]   Oh, so I have to do something different. You have to you have to make something new
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:20.800]   Okay, I'll do this one. That's my my lovely one now swipe left and right and you'll see that you're actually gonna get different points
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.800]   Duo tone. Well, I look at and look at the fonts. That's changing. They're changing too
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.920]   There's a whole bunch of different themes that apple has built in
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.760]   It's not quite free form
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.680]   But apple's loaded in a lot of different options
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.320]   So it you can you can find something that you like probably
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.280]   Including actually one of the other cool things they've done with the depth effect
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.680]   Is that you can take uh do a color cast and just add it to the background of a photo
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.560]   So you have somebody in front of a background. You can make the background
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:50.880]   Um bluer or greener or whatever you want to there's a lot going on. So if I this is good if I can't share a feature
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.000]   I can get her head in front of the time if I pinch it just right
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:00.880]   Right and if it goes too far and it's obscuring the time it will uh it will pop it out of that mode
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.600]   Now I can add widgets after I've picked so let's put the weather in there
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.560]   But can I move that around?
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:14.240]   I think I think it goes left to I think it goes left or right, but you can't drag them back and forth
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.800]   Okay, and then so I oh, okay. I can't
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.440]   Okay
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.600]   Yeah, there's a lot
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.440]   News let's put some news in there
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.000]   Okay, you're gonna run out of space really quick because the widget area is just right
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.520]   Online
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.360]   It'll fit two large ones or or a few small and I can't move that around. That's just gonna be okay
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.480]   I can only move Lisa around. Okay, right?
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.360]   And when you add the widgets she no longer pops in front of the time because she would obscure the widgets right
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.680]   So it's all it's all interlinked together
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.560]   And then I can do this. Yeah, but and and it's that is the font linked to the picture style
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.960]   Uh, no, you can I think you can tap on the if you tap on the time you can pick the time
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:06.000]   M color from there because there's different sometimes I like better than others. I like that uh, yeah that nice syrup one
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.920]   That's cool very nice. Thank you, Jason for the in service
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.440]   Little walk little walk through little walk through you know, I guess I bet I wasn't the only person who went
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.680]   Where's all the cool stuff? There's supposed to be some cool stuff in here
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:25.280]   Oh, another thing that's interesting about that lock screen is that it can be lock screens can be tied to focus modes
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:31.280]   So if you use focus mode, you can actually have like a work lock and home screen and uh, and uh, uh, uh, you know
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.640]   Don't bother me lock at home screen and all those things and they and it'll change dynamically
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.920]   Oh, so you could have a quite a few quite a few screens then so nice. Yep
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.840]   Okay, now i'm done and I I swipe out of it and now I have
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.120]   No longer have my as my wallpaper, which is good. They go together. They're paired
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.480]   Uh, nice. Okay. Cool. I like that very good
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.400]   I was like that was that was great. Now there are some things that iOS 16 mentioned
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.920]   That aren't coming live activities
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.720]   We'll arrive later this year
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:13.360]   That's you stay on top of things that are happening real time right from your lock screen. So I didn't get that as an option
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.120]   And that's the stuff that's feeding the dynamic island as well as the third party live
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:23.120]   Okay, so that's coming later live activities API as well. That's for the yeah
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.960]   So this is again, I just want to say this is one of those important things where the dynamic island is going to
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:33.200]   Only be some apple apps when it launches and then it will take a few months for apple to roll this out to developers so that they can
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.520]   Support it too. I do. I like that idea of john travolta being on my lock screen, but okay
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.080]   Uh, without live activities app clips won't support it when the new operating system launches. It'll finish
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:52.000]   Do the free form the flexible canvas. That's that's that weird whiteboard thing. That's coming later
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.520]   They gave that a big big showcase during ww
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.600]   Yeah, which was puzzling so like so a lot of people are going to be asking why is it why isn't but it's probably going to be rolling out
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.240]   As soon as they've got the very very latest
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.400]   latest
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.680]   Whichever OS ships last that's when all the other OS are going to get right reform
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.040]   Because it's supposed to be cross platform cross it kind of makes more sense on an ipad or on a bigger desktop than on a phone
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.720]   So same same for the shared photo library feature a lot of people talking about that feature not being available at launch
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.200]   But if you put things in the shared photo library on ios 16
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.160]   And then look at it on your ipad that's an ipad os 15 those photos are gone. Oh, they disappear
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.160]   in the shared library so you really need to bring them all in sync
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:44.080]   Uh, so the yeah like Andy said whatever the last version is I imagine it'll be ipad os and macOS will ship simultaneously in october
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:49.120]   And there will also be ios 16.1 at that point and and then all that stuff will be turned on
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.240]   So october let's talk about it
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.440]   Uh
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.720]   Apparently some people were told at the event see you next month
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.240]   So i'm going to take that as confirmation
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:11.680]   That there will be the other thing about these movies is that it is a lot easier for apple to do the move the movies are
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.360]   A big thing, but they're not all bunched up so you can do them
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:21.520]   What's different now is from a production perspective you can do them much closer together because the production might start
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.400]   Way out in advance, but those are different teams and they're overlapped and there's post and production
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.480]   And so they could do them at a much higher rate
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:34.480]   They've probably been working on you know the ipad the new m2 chip those videos for some time
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.800]   There's just a different team doing it right? Yeah
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.920]   Well, and there's some things that'll be at the last minute and there'll be other things that well
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:45.360]   We know we need a we need to watch animation and the watch animation like all the geometry has been done for a year right?
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.520]   the last year I
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.360]   You got the strong perspective that they actually
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:55.040]   Literally pulled the iPhone segments out of that video and pushed them back a month and put them in the next video, right?
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.320]   It gives you the ability to drop things out just move them somewhere else if you want to yeah, so
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:07.200]   Last week we kind of speculated maybe october 18th because that's the third Tuesday of october
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.880]   Gives us some breathing room times to buy all that stuff in our checkbooks to recover slightly
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.840]   Also some breathing room for the october 6th event for from google not that it's going to be if
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.520]   Google's gonna be announcing a phone and a watch god help them
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.120]   But so so it's not it so they're really competing but they'll probably want to get some air between themselves and that event
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:32.000]   I just I'm see now. I never thought I'd say poor google, but I know poor. No, no
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.840]   I'm beyond poor google. I'm like oh my god
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:42.880]   It's like how many calories how many how much of your CPU been with google you're spending finding new rakes to step on when it comes to
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.480]   Going
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.000]   It's like uh and incidentally they announced that they're not going to make a pixel book
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.880]   Jeff Jarvis's heart is going to be broken
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:57.280]   They're they had a team. They I think they probably were pretty close to having a finished product and they decided to kill it
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.920]   Unbelievable
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.400]   Syndrome exercise made for the past. This is the summer of sundar saying hey look we are contracting
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.880]   We are we're gonna make sure that we're not no longer wasting time money and effort and resources on stuff that is not necessarily
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.360]   part of our central mantra
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   And if they figure that hey, we don't need to make mixed pixel books anymore because the
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.360]   We don't want to compete with people who are doing them better and cheaper than us. We're not gonna do that anymore
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.040]   You know, I think that the problem really for google of the let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks is that
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.200]   You know a decade ago. It was where maybe 15 years ago. It was like I can't wait to see what google does next
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.880]   Five years ago people we worked with were like well, I like to give them a little time like three six months before we
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.760]   And then you know five you know five years ago now
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.840]   10 years ago that was like that then five years ago it was kind of like I'd like to see it run for a couple years before I commit
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.000]   And now the people I talked to is just sort of like I no new no new things
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.960]   Like like we just want to do this thing and we'll we'll see what they do because they're just so afraid that google will cancel it
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.000]   And they're gonna so that they don't want to put any effort into anything
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.120]   That google does now because until they really unless they really feel like it's bound to the os and there's no way to take it out
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.720]   But any but when they do when they kill these projects
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.000]   Oftentimes very quickly. I mean within a series of years
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.560]   Rather than a decade or something
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.840]   It really it really damages their ability to get new developers and and people to jump on to what they're trying to do
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.480]   Which is what apple's pretty good at because they don't do as much
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:28.400]   They don't do as much and they do it very slowly and they they're behind on those things
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.480]   But then they just kind of crank like a big old tank
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.840]   You know forward and people know they can get on it and it may not go as fast
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.920]   But it it probably won't stop
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.240]   Google's in an interesting position though because every if they try if they had the if they had the most successful phone in the world
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.720]   And I think the pixels are very good phone, but if they said, oh my god
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:49.840]   We can't make them fast enough. We are we're every every quarter. We're getting 5% more of the market 5% more of the market
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:54.640]   Well, how do how does sam sug feel about that and how do all the other android device makers?
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:59.920]   I think they're where it comes to hardware like like chromebooks and like pixels
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.920]   They have to figure out we want to be successful enough that we maintain a presence and that we maintain a good example
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.800]   Of how good this hard work can be when it works with our software, but if they are too successful
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:17.680]   They're samson's gonna say well guess what we're putting another billion dollars into our ties in development because let's let's have our own operating system
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.040]   And see how well that works for us. I mean the problem is is that like for instance when they don't put when they have their software division
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:29.280]   Build something that the hardware division won't put in so the one when they had light are they didn't put it into the pixel
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.400]   And and so light are died years before and then apple came in and it's magical
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:40.320]   You know because it's on it's in every it's in many many different phones and it's and it's something that they're building out and it's
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:47.760]   Totally useful and google was way ahead like it was and I think that their light are was at least as good as what apple's putting into the phone now
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.800]   And but they were you know and they just killed it and part of it was they didn't put it on their own phones
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.920]   Like we had to buy those phones from china
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:02.080]   You know to do tests and do development on the on the um for light are on those phones. It was just insane
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.840]   It just felt insane like you're rolling this out and you're not putting your own hardware
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.520]   Well that that was at a time when they that was the when they're doing the nexus line
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:15.280]   I think and that's also when they were basically trying to make sure this wasn't a premium smartphone sort of thing
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.640]   They were trying to keep keep the prices low so that they could be a good felt from but you but your your point is very well taken
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.000]   Particularly with messaging but yeah for hardware too sometimes
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.720]   Scooterx told me that I should update my phone now that I have iOS 16 not because a lot of apps are updating
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040]   I notice halide too for instance. We'll have a
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.320]   What lock screen widget which they say is the most asked for feature of this
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.600]   High-end camera app so I guess you can do it right from the lock screen, especially with an R. He's on screen
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.440]   That's gonna be nice. That's gonna be nice. So just to wrap it up october. We don't know when
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:57.200]   We don't know what but probably an i new ipad new ipad pros new max with the m2 chip
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.880]   Anything else to see I'll be interested to see if they if they
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.240]   the cadence it'll be interesting to see
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:12.400]   And the you know the ipad but I do think that the ipad and mac mini seem to they've done that before
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:17.120]   Where they put both of those into the same right event. Yeah, which max will we see?
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.080]   I don't think we'll see I don't know if we'll see the pro in october 16 inch. Yeah lap top
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.120]   I think it'll let me go come later to pro or ultra now. I think the pro might come later
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.760]   I might think it might be a December Mac pro later. Yeah
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.880]   There's this plenty of precedent for for apple
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.480]   Meeting a deadline for a Mac pro by saying yeah in December
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.280]   We announced when it's going to ship and it's not gonna ship in 2020. That's when it did a little trash can but
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.640]   Yeah, I've I've been very disappointed if they don't update the iMac though. Excuse me the mac mini because that's yeah
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:52.160]   That's that's a really bad missing. Yeah missing. That's the best computer. They made myself. I have
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.840]   Yeah, so many of them
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:00.000]   It feels like they yeah, yeah, yeah, they're that intel mac mini that's still hanging out there because they really need a mac mini
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.080]   That's not just on an m1
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:08.320]   It's got to be right like I think it's an open question. What else there is but the mac mini I think it's got to be there
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.800]   I really like the mac studios though. I mean that's kind of to me a swole mac mini
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.680]   It is except the big thing I would say is that for the average person the mac studio is great
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:21.920]   I have I have a mac mini and a max studio scene a max mac mini sitting right on top my max studio right here
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.880]   Um, and they're both great machines. It's just that the mac mini
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.080]   For the price is just an insane value, you know like the studio is a good value
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:38.160]   The mac mini is an insane value at at $650 and what happens is as the developers start writing
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.280]   To metal and as we talked about this last week
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.480]   But as they start really writing to the to the os the way that apple has guided them towards doing
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.200]   The performance just keeps it just keeps on yielding more and more and more
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.440]   It's you know most of the performance issues right now are just
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.320]   Developers not taking full advantage of the hardware, you know and and um again
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.720]   I'm you know, I've been talking to a couple of them and it's just they say as you keep on digging into that
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:09.200]   You know, you just keep on getting there's just more efficiency to be had what about a new iMac and iMac pro
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200]   We think that might be next month
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.240]   Anything's possible
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:19.600]   Mac matt matt mark erman mark erman whose source is about the iMac seem a little shaky to me seems to say that they're no new
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.720]   iMacs until 2023 which is really disappointing to me
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:29.040]   Because you think that they could just drop an m2 and the existing iMac and it would be nice if they did a larger iMac with a better chip
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:38.160]   But he says that's that's a next year. It may be an m3 before we actually get another iMac revision which blows my mind
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.640]   But they can't just do an event with an ipad pro and a mac mini right there's got to be some other mac to update there
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.760]   I would think maybe the macbook pro. It's been a year
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:56.560]   Could they do macbook pro 14 and 16 and and that would be the unveiling of the whatever the high-end m2 processors are for the first time
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.640]   I think that's probably the best bet
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.600]   Well, we'll find out soon enough
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.120]   Just just quick quick thing about the the iMac pro we
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:12.480]   You remember that the we didn't see the first iMac pro came out during the
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.480]   During the year of embarrassment when apple had to say yeah
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.400]   We had an idea for the mac pro. It was terrible. You all hated it
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.520]   We were gonna start all over again in the meantime here is a not here is an iMac pro that we managed to
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.360]   We managed to we managed to wait for a week when johnny
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:35.680]   I was away so we could cram as as many fans as we could possibly fit into the iMac so that we could get top quality
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.080]   Intel processes into the thing and give you the high powerful workstation that you actually wanted
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.640]   So i'm i'm i'm i wouldn't bet against there being an iMac pro next year
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.720]   But i'm wondering if they have any real commitment to continuing that line
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:53.520]   Or if they're just going to say that the iMac is the the iMac is the the original mac 128
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.160]   It's the easy to pick up and transport from one room to another easy to set up a room full of them
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:01.360]   medium power to low power machines that anybody can
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:06.720]   Afford and they're going to be and they're saying that if you want something that is like an iMac but pro level
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.360]   By yourself a mac studio by yourself
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.080]   Nicely kitted out mac mini
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.240]   Yeah, i think i think i think i think i think
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.240]   gandy is right like there's no
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:22.320]   Guarantee here because that iMac pro was a one-off from a alternate timeline
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.880]   Right and i love mine, but it was a one-off from an alternate timeline that apple didn't go down. However
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.800]   I think there's a read and and mark german i know has had some some suggestions that this is going on
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.360]   That that's not really what they're gonna do what they're really done is they're gonna give the larger
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.800]   Remember there used to be two sizes of iMac and now there's only one
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.320]   That they're going to do a larger iMac and the way they'll brand it will probably be iMac pro
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.400]   But we we use that as shorthand it might not be it might just be a larger iMac
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.160]   But i think there's definitely a strong possibility that they're not going to be happy with just the the existing
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:02.320]   M1 iMac shape and there might be a larger model and that's the thing where all i think short-handing is iMac pro
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.760]   But it may not be and call that and it may not truly be a pro level
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.320]   iMac it may be
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.480]   You know an m2 and not an m2 pro or m2 max processor inside. What do you think about an iMac studio?
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:17.600]   I love the studio name
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.800]   I think the studio name could has really it really has some legs and there's a bunch of interesting products that they could release
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.520]   I think there could be an ipad studio too. That's a big ipad
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.120]   But an iMac studio that instead of iMac pro
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:36.080]   That's a cool name. I think that would be awesome and and yes x bonus points if you can if you if it's got a touch screen on it or
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:41.920]   With a really really great great great screen. Yeah, I think that the issue really is is that the
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.480]   How much of the max studio is a fan
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.960]   You know like like it's there's a big there's a big piece of that max studio there when you look at it when you're gonna break down
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.360]   It's a big fan so I think that getting the studio level performance into an iMac
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.400]   form factor could be
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.880]   Challenging in pro level. I think that the iMac makes a lot of sense you keep on getting thinner with the smaller chips
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.040]   But I think when you get to the bigger ones, I think it might be difficult
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.520]   I
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:11.040]   Let's see what else is going on
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:18.720]   We'll find out about this all next month. I hope I hope and maybe a mac pro in december
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:25.760]   Congratulations to ted lasso apple tv won a few emmys last night
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.800]   Ted lasso best comedy jason sudeikis best lead actor in a comedy
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.360]   For hill stain best supporting actor in a comedy which we looked at which one is is he is he that right?
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.920]   Can't it's all right kid right?
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.480]   Yeah, right here
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:43.920]   Okay, good
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.320]   Good. I am very curious to see if they do tie-ins with mls and ted lasso
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:54.240]   That will be epic like if they start tying the the show into the like
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:59.920]   Just kind of blows my mind to tie tie both of those things no one's ever had no one's ever had
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.160]   Those two things in one place like total control over broadcast over
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.040]   Uh the the sport that you have a show about is a unique situation
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.960]   There's some danger and it obviously of tying those things together so they may not
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:15.760]   But the possibilities are kind of insane
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.440]   So
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.280]   Severance took a couple of emmys main title design which was quite good for severance. Although I always skipped it after the first
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.760]   one and
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.800]   music composition for a series I guess they had music
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360]   Uh schmigadoon
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.760]   Outstanding original music and lyrics for the corn put in episode
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.880]   And outstanding short-form comedy drama variety series carpool carot karaoke
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.840]   Um
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:46.320]   Gosh, I thought severance maybe should have won more but uh
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:53.440]   Some competition right tough succession deserved. I think the best drama. I what an amazing show that is
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440]   I'm just glad that lizzo got to make got to make an
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.120]   Lizzo that was good. Yeah, lizzo got best reality show good for her
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:05.440]   Didn't make didn't make up for bobboating Kirk losing but still yeah, how did that happen?
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:09.760]   But you know what this was a tough that's gonna be getting harder and harder for the emmys because it's not just you know
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.640]   Network television anymore. It's it's come there. You're competing. It's some good stuff
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.040]   And the hard part is is that the math is so different for the streamers, you know, like it's yeah
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.040]   It's really like watching
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.360]   I mean HBO knows it has something with game of thrones
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:26.880]   So they're just dumping money into it and then you look at lord of the rings where they spent
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:32.400]   You know most of the money if not all the money and then you know and they're in amazon and apple have very different models and hbo
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.480]   You know at least against one that is almost a guaranteed lock, right?
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:43.040]   You know the level the production level on those show and some of these shows is just leaving anything we saw in tv
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.800]   um behind yeah, how is you know csi las vegas good the great feet
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.560]   I mean you just you know, yeah
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.760]   Because because when you when you watch it, there's just so many predictable models
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.160]   We have a x number of sets we have x number of then you know
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:01.200]   There's all the and someone who does production you just watched all the practical things that people are doing to save money
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.960]   Because you know you still have to it has still has to pay for itself with advertising and other
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.720]   Incinification and you know all these other things that that uh, and this it still has to pencil out
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.520]   You know and so and with the with apple and amazon it does not it does not have to pencil out
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.800]   And that's the and that's a really uh, that's really hard math to compete with when someone's playing a game that
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:23.360]   As we talked about before it's kind of the kyzer so same level
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:26.560]   Whether kit has launched dark sky. Goodbye
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.080]   by year end the dark sky for ios
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.200]   wind down
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.640]   operations they acquired it in march 2020
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:43.200]   And as of january 1st, 2023 dark sky will no longer be available. I presume all of the features
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:51.760]   Have been moved into apples weather kit app. I hope yeah, the interface is different and so people who love that app are going to be a little disappointed
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:54.800]   The interface is totally different. Yeah, I am. Yeah
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.320]   Weather kit subscriptions have launched as of
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:05.200]   Yesterday so developers can now add that weather data to their own app. So I suppose you could write a new ui
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:09.440]   That's like dark sky and put weather kit in it and you you'd be happy
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:12.080]   That's actually pretty cool to be able to
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.000]   It could potentially
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.160]   Give you an entire, you know, like a whole new set of apps because you don't have to figure out the data problem
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.000]   Yeah, like we're gonna give you all the stuff that you want out of that because that's really hard to
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.640]   Oh, anybody who's who's used weather apps one of the reasons dark sky did so well as they had their own
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.760]   Server but all the other weather apps you have to choose a server and maybe you have to get an api key and maybe you have to pay for it
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:39.120]   And blah blah blah. It's just not not a good experience. Yeah an apple. I presume apples weather kit will have
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.560]   the best information, right?
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:48.080]   You'll get up to 500,000 api calls per month with the apple developer program membership for 99 bucks
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:52.480]   but if you're gonna obviously if you're gonna be a big app you're gonna need more than that and
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:55.760]   weather kit will allow
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.200]   apps
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.920]   Yeah for the watch tvOS mac OS ipad OS and iOS
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:04.880]   And there's a rest api so you can actually just
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.840]   It also means that if somebody wants to make a cross-platform app they want to make a with an app
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.480]   for android or windows that uses
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:16.400]   Weather kit they can do that too. They just use the rest api to get the data
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:20.960]   Yeah, and for as an individual half a million calls a month is probably more than enough
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:26.640]   Yeah, I mean what they'll do is they'll they'll end up having you know millions and paying apple
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:30.240]   A few thousand you know thousands of dollars for the data source and rolling it in for their users
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:37.760]   Although I I'm an apple developer to get access to the betas and I I rebuilt my weather widgets that I use to use weather
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:44.480]   nice api because I boy I could refresh like every minute and not run into that lens. It's just me
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.360]   So uh, yeah, I might start playing with that a little bit too. It's fun. Yeah, dude
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:53.360]   So where are you putting your weather? Are you using some of those little widget things?
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:59.680]   I've got I'm using the previous pick uh swift bar to put a little a little chart in my
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.480]   In my menu bar and I've got a little web page for my weather station. That's got a forecast now
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:11.760]   And uh, I've got a widget from scriptable the app on my ipad that shows the like seven day forecast
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:14.080]   How hard is it to to call the api?
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.960]   It's I mean it's a rest api so there's there's a little thing that you have to do
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.400]   Whatever your programming language is to do the
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:28.880]   authentication where you have to say like here's my you have to go on to the apple developer website and generate a key and you have to hand the key
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:35.920]   Cryptographically signed every time you make a request but once you once you write that code and there are plenty of examples out there
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.760]   All you get back is a json file and at that point all you're doing is parsing
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.160]   Uh, so there's a get call using land latitude and and longitude
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.280]   Just issue that get call you'll get a that's it bunch of json code back that you then parse
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:55.520]   And I give you and I as somebody who has a weather station. I have been so used to writing scripts that parse my historical data
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.480]   And then I got the access to this api and i'm like wait a second
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.880]   Now it now it's the future like it's so weird. That's cool. What do you mean?
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:09.120]   I've got the next eight days with weather information. That's really awesome. Yeah, that's that's yeah, I might play with that
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:14.640]   Put a put a conky widget on my desktop or something. That's neat. Yep
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:20.800]   So yeah sad to lose dark sky, but sounds like this is going to be a nice replacement
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.560]   Uh, let's see
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.480]   If we covered everything that we wanted to cover before we
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.200]   go to break
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:37.200]   This is always challenging because there's so much to talk about any anything you guys want to say about the the event or
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.520]   uh any
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.000]   We should mention uh, there was a um
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.800]   A story that apples hardware subscription service is not dead
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.800]   It may still arrive still in the works according to german mark german
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.160]   Uh, he says the program would differ from an installment program in that the monthly charge
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:06.080]   Wouldn't be the price of the device amortized over one or two years. It would be a yet to be determined monthly fee depending on which device you use
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:12.240]   Uh, maybe you could even uh swap out your device for a new model when new hardware comes out
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:16.160]   So it's basically a monthly an iPhone for a monthly fee
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.040]   Right possibly degrading in apple one bundles, etc
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.400]   So we don't know when that would be announced. Maybe that would be something they'd bring up in october
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:32.880]   Maybe I mean, I think they want to sell as many iPhones as they possibly can before they start the subscription thing
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.440]   So maybe you would see that like in 2023, right?
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:42.320]   Yeah, I mean you want to get over the hump right of the last time you want to launch a new service like this is the moment where you sell your most iPhones
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:48.960]   Right because you want to shake out the bugs when it's at the low period and then go into next year
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.600]   Um, so the one having to soak it up the bugs what's the worst so q3?
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:56.720]   Or cute holiday quarter
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:02.400]   I think is the worst for them because it's it's right after launch and then it's that's their highest iphone sales quarter is the holiday quarter
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.640]   So maybe this summer would be a good time to do it
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.480]   Yeah, even even first of the year might be a fine time to do it because it gives them you know nine months to be ready for the new iphone launch
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:12.480]   Yeah
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.720]   Okay, your rides here. So we better take a break
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.840]   I don't know who's right it is, but it's here and
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.480]   Do our
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:28.320]   Pics of the week i'm going to start today with something i'm going to go out of the box and start with Alex lindsey
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:32.560]   And his pick is so we i'm super excited about this one
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:39.280]   So anyway, so we've been testing zoom i so we've been using zoom i so so office hours
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:45.920]   Our show if you go to see the show it all runs on a mixture of zoom i so and his adora and everything else
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.400]   But we basically pull all the tenety feet all the tenety p-feeds so oftentimes up to 20
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:57.920]   Feeds out of zoom and then we put them into our switcher and everything else and the key is
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:03.920]   Unlike the way oh, no, I know actually does event still like we because we are needs to be you know
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:11.600]   We were not ready to jump into it yet and the way that we do it here at twit is that instead of going one device at a zoom
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:15.680]   Source we have so this is a machine for each of you guys
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:21.200]   So what we've done what zoom i so does is it lets us have a meeting where all of us can see each other and there's
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:26.240]   Half the latency and we're just grabbing the file that the image the we're grabbing
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.400]   Everything from the back end and pulling it in so that we can edit it so you still get an isolated
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:36.480]   Camera an isolated video of everybody audio and video yeah
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:39.440]   Audio and here's the thing is not just that you get an isolated video
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:43.840]   It's that you get Dante so you get or loop back or whatever so you can take
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:47.360]   I want these 16 people and I want all of those as individual channels
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:51.760]   Going to to loop back or Dante or siphon or whatever you know, whatever you want to do there
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:57.920]   And uh, the that's for real time right that's if you wanted to do real time switching or something or well
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:02.960]   So so yeah, so if we have don't Dante it means that now I can control all the volumes
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:07.280]   I mean everything you were doing here what we're doing here. We can do and zoom i so except
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.280]   That our latency would be half of what it is now
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.800]   Um, and you know, there's a bunch of you know like and the other thing is is that it's one like we have multiple
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.680]   Like I have an on I know I have 16
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.640]   Computers so that I can have up to 16 people
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:30.640]   Um, I what we the density here is 12 people coming out of a mac mini with one car with two cards
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:35.920]   You know you have is this limited by the cards and it's less than 50% CPU use utilization
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:41.040]   This is a bad bandwidth use utilization. Is it oh, it's it's it's you know, it's up to 100 megs
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.560]   So so the you know, so you can take so you 12 of them. You're gonna be pulling 100 megs of of data
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:51.440]   You're not pulling all 12 streams out individually individually. Yeah, you are
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:58.640]   Yeah, yeah, so you do need a lot of man with or 100 megs for 12 people. Yeah, so I mean it's gonna reduce the quality
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.320]   No, no, it's actually higher quality so they're using because they're getting they've gotten out of the way
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.000]   They're basically they're saying as soon as zoom comes in the raw video feed
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.160]   They do a scale and then they give it to apple. They give it, you know, so it's only runs on the mac
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:15.680]   Um, and they you can get if you're on a pc you can use zoom
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:24.320]   Rooms to get ndi so they say a mac mini m1 has been able to achieve eight hd outputs mac studio 12 hd
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.800]   outputs. Wow
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.800]   Yeah, so you can take this this is this is huge
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:32.880]   So like what just for normal people who are going what the hell are they talking about?
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.320]   So
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.560]   Here's like I have a big I have a big I have a half a million dollars of hardware that and twit
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.440]   I'm sure has close to that managing these shows
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.800]   Um, what i'm building right now. I'm literally ordering the card this afternoon or i'm getting i'm not the card
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.960]   I have the cards. I'm ordering a
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:53.200]   one of the new sti from black magic the little um
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.000]   eight channel, but sti now the extremes
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.960]   I can take a mac mini and take
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.480]   Uh, eight outputs and put them into my extreme
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.800]   And now I have eight I could cut my own show with super sources and all the other things
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.440]   I can also send all the audio channels out. Can you cut it live as individ? Yeah, you could yeah
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:15.440]   Okay, yeah, because that's we like to cut it live because we don't want to we want to reduce post
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:19.520]   Yeah, anything that's the whole thing di and I wanted to throw in here that um
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:21.360]   I'm doing jump on Alex's pick
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.080]   But um one of the great things about this is this company to build this
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:30.400]   Limitless this was a third party that was kind of hacking zoom very weirdly, but they were bought by zoom
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:36.320]   So this is gonna this is zoom's brought like broadcasting play eventually. They're gonna
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.000]   They're gonna push this thing in where it's like completely legit
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.360]   An actual version of zoom, but every single person on the call because yeah people don't know
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.840]   We're not on one zoom call together. We're on individual zoom calls with the studio
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:55.920]   And so we're all double latency and it's not as good. That's why we step on each other's words here and stuff like that
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:02.240]   But this gets you all of that isolated audio and video for switching and directing live or for capturing and editing later
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.040]   All just running on a mac mini and because the funny thing is because it's just what they call
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.920]   I think it's consuming the and then it's a source
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.960]   You don't actually have to switch on a mac the mac mini is just there to kind of eat your zoom files
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.640]   And output it on your network to whatever device you're using that as a multi-camera switch
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.040]   NDI so we
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.560]   For that
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.520]   Yeah, it's or do NDI that way or you can do or you can do SDI and the SDI has a lower head
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:33.040]   The SDI
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:41.120]   Has lower head hit on the CPU so you can actually do more outputs on the SDI than NDI and it's it's I think the visual quality is a little higher
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.080]   but the
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.200]   the
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:50.160]   We currently use SDI we have we could do both. Yeah, so you could literally take to do what to do this show or pretty much any show that you do
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.840]   You can have a mac mini with a sonnet box and a and a quad card and it would push everybody up
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:00.640]   John says says like we're gonna need an M1 Mac Leo
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:08.240]   This is a beta and it's a little shaky but boy the potential here so where have you been using it Jason
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:16.680]   Well, I want to do for our live streams for the video stuff that we do including the the I mean the theater
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.680]   Wouldn't it be
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:25.040]   Playing anything any video that we're doing live like I use e-cam live and I know that a lot of people to it use it too
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:30.800]   Mike uses it for his shows the the you know right now what we're doing is you screen capture zoom, right?
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.640]   So you're literally just capturing individual people and cutting them up and with this every person is on their own track
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:43.200]   And it means you can also like format like the the canvas of who goes where and just say put this person here
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.000]   And it's their video instead of like I'm gonna screen capture
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.480]   Nobody move the zoom window and I'm gonna make this little rectangle and put it over there
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.480]   So it's a it's just a huge usability
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:58.160]   Improvement too. Yeah, and there's no, you know, there's no debris on the screen
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.120]   You know, it's just a raw feed that comes out. That's another problem
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:05.840]   You know, we have to zoom into you guys so you can't see all the the stuff
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:13.440]   Frame rate. Yeah, so all there's no debris the frame rate is better. The color is better good name for the the latency is
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:16.640]   You know, I died to someone else called it that night
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:22.000]   Great, exactly. I was he's an office hours. He said, oh, there's all this debris and I never
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.640]   anyway, so so the
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.200]   But all of that's gone. They don't have the licensing stuff that Skype says oh you have to put
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:31.840]   You know logo on it or whatever or I talk about it
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:38.400]   They don't have any of that and the thing is is that you're the magic the real magic sauce here for us has been
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.720]   if you take like
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:45.840]   Even if what I'm gonna be building I'm building a mini kit that is just something for myself like for me to test
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.800]   I'm doing this, you know, I'm doing gray matter with with Michael Krasney
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:53.120]   And so we're gonna be building it for that so that I because like we have a big kit
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:57.120]   And we have a lot of people doing it and I want to do something to see how far I can do it by myself
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:00.080]   So you need an m1 Mac a mini would be fine, right?
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.360]   Or do you want to use a max studio for this use a studio?
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.200]   Yeah, what I'm gonna do is use a I have a studio, but I'm gonna use a Mac mini
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.800]   Okay, um in a sonic card is there are there external on it box
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:11.520]   Son of box
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.040]   It's us that's the thunderbolt to the sonic box and that holds a card
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.560]   And then what I'm gonna put in there is a black magic quad card, which will give me eight outputs, right?
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:27.040]   That should be an answer anybody. Yeah, that'll send eight out. Well except for us because office hours is like 16 people so
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:29.520]   um, but normally it would
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.040]   We would take eight out and I put it into an a 10 mini extreme iso the new sdi version
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:40.160]   So I don't have to have any of the convert we put it into a tricaster obviously. Yeah, you could yeah, absolutely
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:42.640]   Is the black magic send out sdi
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.240]   Yeah, so yeah the black magic card
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:53.920]   Um that is connected as sdi out and the new black magic mini extreme is sdi in so the it's the little form factor
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:56.000]   But it's anyway, so it and then
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.520]   um
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:04.080]   So then I have the and then what i'm using is a program called nix effect pro which kind of transforms the the a 10 into
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:07.040]   A bigger switcher like it literally multiplies the value
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:11.040]   Like 10x and so what you do is you can program tons of super sources into it
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:14.080]   They'll animate between them each other they'll switch between them
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:19.600]   And that's the base that i'm gonna work with and that i'm literally cutting most of the show on an ipad
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:23.840]   Like i'm literally just tapping on an ipad like I want this shot. I literally did a I did a show for
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:31.040]   30,000 people literally sitting on an ipad with nix effect pro cutting between stuff, you know and um
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.040]   So it's so anyway, so it makes it kind of makes the a 10 magical
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:41.440]   And then when we start taking zoom osc which is also made by liminal, which is owned by zoom
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.280]   Um, we get all the data out who's who's in there who's talking who's doing like all the things that zoom is
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:54.160]   Reporting and so what we can really get into is that's when we start taking what's called is adora by by trichotronics
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:59.840]   Um, we take is adora and is adora is a low code, you know, mostly nodal brain
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:06.720]   Right and so we start making all the decisions. I want you to automatically do this when I hit like for instance in office hours when we hit
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:10.880]   Um put the lower third up. It knows who's up
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:17.200]   It puts the lower third up, you know, like it doesn't i don't have to figure out who's who it just puts it in there and it's all formatted using
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.400]   um
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.840]   spx graphics, which is a free, you know, it's a free platform so
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:24.400]   um, so anyway, so the
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:30.800]   So all of that stuff can be integrated because we have all these isos out and because we have and then the audio now can be we can
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.520]   Uh, we can mix the audio
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:39.920]   Um because we get out of dante that's going to go into an x32 and eventually, um, it's actually going eventually it's going to go into what's called
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.760]   Alyssa, which is a um surround sound so
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:47.920]   We're actually we can actually take because we're getting the iso audio out
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:53.840]   Without adding any other dn betters or anything else. We're just going to send that into a surround and we're going to spread everybody out
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.360]   into into into a surround mix for youtube
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.280]   Um, and so but all of that's done all of that's possible
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:05.200]   um because of uh zoom iso and and and we're
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:12.720]   We're on zoom iso one. So the whole show that if you go to office hours dot global or whatever that whole show is is a mixture of
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:19.440]   um zoom iso zoom o sc isodora universe a you know mix effect pro makes that show
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.600]   You know is that's how that show gets done. Nice
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.520]   the the
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.480]   We're going to now spend the next six weeks. It's going to be a little bit rough
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.920]   But we've decided I could spend the next six months doing this on the weekends and trying to figure this out or we can all just work
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:36.240]   Together and turn it over to to version two and we're going to turn it over
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:41.120]   So so we're going to so the next six weeks. We're going to turn all is invaded though. So we'll wait
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:46.160]   It is in beta. I will say that my experience so far is that it is uh the beta of two is
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:52.480]   Much more stable than the nice release version of one because release version of one was written by a little company
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.480]   Right and and uh as i have two was written by a zoom team
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:01.040]   Right, you know that had access to making requests and having them actually get done
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:07.920]   And so so and and I and I will say that it's it's um this is the reason that i'm so excited about this is that I spent
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.920]   I mean, I don't know how many meetings I had with uh, you know with folks. They're working on skype tx
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:17.920]   Uh with folks that were working on hangouts with folks that are like saying this is what we need
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.280]   I need a box that I can put out all the outputs. You know, I can do this I can do this I can do this
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:28.080]   And and I kept on asking for you know all of the stuff and everyone's like, oh, yeah, but that seems really hard and um
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.040]   And liminal liminal and now zoom
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.480]   Took this on and they pulled out all the stops, you know, and I don't think this is the end
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:42.480]   This is just their first drop of this is what it looks like when you have an internal now an internal team at zoom with
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.200]   the focus and
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:47.200]   and support for management to
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.840]   Run down the field at full speed, you know, and I think that this makes a huge difference in
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.120]   And again the from from an accessibility perspective
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.520]   This tool
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.920]   Means that you can do shows at a fraction of the cost that you could
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:07.280]   Two weeks ago, you know, like, you know, and and it just means that sounds like it's not a phrase
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:09.440]   Like I gotta buy a lot of crap
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:15.760]   It's well for someone who's for someone who's i'm Jason Jason said that you could just do this with another mac right
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:21.600]   Mac to math with an india that's the brilliance of it is you can scale from me on my mac doing a dnd stream
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:27.360]   Right through twit all the way up to alex because once you've got those streams on their own
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:32.960]   You can do anything you want with them, right? Yeah, yeah, and it's and so how do you separate them if you're going?
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.000]   You don't separate them you just play it out to the streamer
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:43.120]   Jason yeah, what's interesting for me with like something like he came live you basically said every and every person in your call is a
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:47.440]   Source right and so you can you can set up you switch in the mac
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.720]   You can you can switch in the mac. Yeah, you don't need an external switcher
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:53.360]   Although, you know, you more professional setups will have them
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:57.520]   But I just switch I assign some stream deck buttons to the different takes
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:02.480]   You know the different canvases that i've set up and I switch among them and this is this will be much again
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:08.240]   Much easier because now you've got isolated audio and video on individual tracks instead of what you used to have which is
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.800]   a screen capture where you're grabbing pixels and a single audio track of the entire call which is
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:20.400]   No, and the and the you know whether you're using ecam or memo live or other things like that on the mac or
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:25.440]   Still wouldn't use obs on the mac when anyway, so so anyway, so the e-cam or memo live or the two big ones
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.440]   You can deliver those videos they can cut them. They now again as Jason said you now have iso audio
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:34.160]   So you can control the volume as it relates to everyone in between you can also control sync
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:39.200]   So one of the things that we're adding now that we have iso audio we're going to be pushing that all out into
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:45.520]   The x32 the baron direct 32 and then we can adjust the audio sync per person
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:49.600]   And so we can go through it there and and we can also do equalization and all kinds of other things
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.240]   Which is you know and so we're looking at basically the next step that we're getting is a thing called matchbox
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.600]   Which literally someone can take their ipad and hold it up and it'll automatically
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:02.800]   Sync their audio for every person that's in the panel in you know take a couple minutes, you know, so
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.640]   That's completely personal if we want to do the radio show that way
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.800]   Yeah, could we do that we could have could we could we have people
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:18.240]   What I really need is a lobby that people could call into and then we could bring people up from the lobby into the show
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.000]   Yeah, we do that in zoom all the time. We use that we use breakout rooms for that. Okay, so so what we do is the way we
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.320]   Don't need to waste the time on a map break weekly
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:29.040]   But I should get together we do that because I'd like to figure out a way
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:30.400]   You know the way it works now
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:36.480]   You have a radio station phone number and a rollover and it you know people are in a call screener and people are
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:40.960]   But it'd be nice to have video. I'd like to have video just real quickly that what we do is we
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.240]   Using zoom's breakout rooms. What we do is we have people come in we push them into a breakout room
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:48.640]   And then we talk to them
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.160]   And then we can literally just move them into the show like the producer can just move them
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:52.800]   Oh, that's cool
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:55.200]   Now i'm going to promote you to the show sometimes we send them to hair and makeup
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:57.920]   Which is us checking their stuff if there's a whole bunch of people coming in
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:59.920]   Burke can do hair and makeup
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:05.360]   Is the digital hair and makeup written and but but you literally say okay now we're going to drag you
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:08.560]   We're going to take you to the show and we can literally just drag you into the show
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.320]   And now you're so the breakout rooms are a feature of zoom's like webinars
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:18.400]   Thank you. It's well. It's all their meetings all all do it and the and the other thing that's really powerful is I drag you
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:21.280]   Into that meeting you're not suddenly in front of everybody
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:26.800]   You are just another signal there that is got audio and video coming out to my management system
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.120]   So when you talk to someone so you're not just dropping them into a zoom and suddenly they could talk while you're talking
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.440]   There they could talk and you could hear them in the meeting you would be able to hear them
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.920]   But that doesn't mean they're going to broadcast because we have the iso
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:42.320]   Audio and the iso video coming out and so that's still going into a mixer and a switcher
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:48.640]   Somebody's got put turn that up to do it. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's uh, it's the it's the future like um and uh
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.160]   Well, it might be our future. This sounds really cool. It should be it should this is the way
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.600]   This is again whether you're doing bromclad. We move to zoom
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:00.160]   I have to say zoom has been a much much better choice for for us than skype
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.120]   Oh, it's fact remember skype tried to do something like this. They have that broadcast version of skype x
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:11.120]   The problem was is that the the latency on the skype px box is actually much higher than regular skype
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:17.440]   And and it was it was it was never meant to be this it was a game show piece of software that they bought from somebody else cat
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.400]   Mouse, right?
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:24.400]   And it was never it was never rewritten and what you're seeing here is a is a team that is meticulously rewriting things to be
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:30.960]   To take full advantage of the mac architecture and squeeze out every ounce of quality that they can get out of it
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:37.040]   Anything that would help our latency problems, which have become worse. This is worse half would be well worse. Yeah, taf
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.000]   Yeah, well, we'll figure it out. Anyway, that was a long pick
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.120]   But thank you. I apologize everybody
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.840]   That but you got me got me thinking. How about how about you mr. Jason snell?
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:52.720]   Uh actually let me do Andy and then do you do Jason? Andy has been sitting there very patiently
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.360]   Quiet, yeah a pre-year naturally long time for Andy
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:05.680]   That's okay. I had some pants and eat hemming so I got good darn those socks. Yeah, got some
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:08.080]   Yeah, so my my pick is
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.800]   All trails. It's a website and a phone app
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:15.440]   It's all about finding places to take long walks in nature and I love it stuff like that
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:20.160]   And so it's probably a good pick to to justify that that's $700 $800
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:25.760]   New ultra apple watch. I'm gonna take my watch to the detailer mountain via the western route
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:29.040]   It's I mean, it's it's really cool. I mean, it's it's
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:32.080]   You oftentimes you have no idea
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:38.960]   What kind of really nice nature walks are available to you until you actually look around for them
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.760]   And all trails does that for you either it'll pick up what your actual location is and say hey here are these
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.040]   Here's some really nice trails that are nearby within a few miles of
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.640]   Of your location. You can do of course you can search by play. So if you know that you're going to be
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:55.200]   uh, you got a half a day off and
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:57.120]   In Dayton, Ohio
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.360]   Because you're visiting relatives and you want to get away from humanity for a little bit
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:04.560]   It'll find you nice trails. It has a lot of crowdsourced information
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:10.320]   So a lot of individual reviews a lot of individual photos along with a lot of very practical advice on
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:16.400]   Like you will feel find out if you're looking for something. I just want to take a nice a nice walk
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:22.160]   I don't care about tripping hazards, but I don't want to ever have to like be sitting in the middle of a half
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:26.160]   Halfway up a mountain wondering if it's time for me to call for 911 or not
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:34.480]   Or if you do want the adventure, you can find those kind of ventures trails too. It'll it'll uh, it'll track your progress through a park through a trail
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:39.120]   It'll uh record but you're you're passing president. It'll let you mark things for the future
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:44.080]   It's both a website and an app the both of these things are free to use for most of the
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.960]   Really good discovery features for
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:51.760]   299 a month. It'll give you a long lock whole bunch of extra features like
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:58.160]   being able to save maps to your device, which is important if you're some if if you're outside a cell range for instance
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:01.040]   Access to 3d maps a lot of these extra features
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:05.040]   The only real bummer about that is that 399 is not a lot of money
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.720]   But they don't they they won't just let you subscribe. They will have to charge
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:11.840]   They want to just charge you for the year and it's like
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:15.360]   I I I I tried it for the first time about a month ago
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:21.840]   Definitely signed up for the free trial and then when I found out that I would have let them charge me 299 a month to use it
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:25.120]   For the next two or three months, but when I found out that I was about to be charged 36 bucks
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:28.640]   For to enter into the winter and i'm not going to be scrambling
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:31.600]   Up trails during the during the middle of the winter i'm like, okay
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.280]   Maybe i'll go back to the free version of it
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.040]   But it's really really good even the free features are really really nice and like I said, it's
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.960]   Even if you're near a city it's sometimes very very surprising the really really beautiful walks and hikes
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.000]   They're available to you even if you don't have the right shoes
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.440]   Even if you don't have the walking stick and the 800 dollar
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.000]   The $100 adventure watch
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.840]   You can have a much much better walk than you could like at your with a mall walkers at your local shopping mall
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.600]   I'm installing it right now
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:05.280]   Because it found some really cool trails. I didn't know about exactly in the neighborhood. So that's great
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:13.440]   Alltrails.com and the all trails app and then $36 a year if you decide the pro
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:16.240]   Version is right for you, but you can try it for free
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.480]   Uh very cool
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:22.800]   It might be it might be it might be worth I might do that like in march like when the weather gets better
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:27.600]   But yeah, I'm just not in september here in california. It's probably better to hike in the winter frankly
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.720]   This reminds me actually of an app that uh, I was really pleased
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.240]   To find out about uh from um chris mark wart
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:42.240]   Let me see if I can remember it it's called izi at izi.travel. It's not a
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.560]   It's audio guides crowd sourced. So
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:50.960]   We don't have anything in petaluma, but there's a bunch in san francisco
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:56.160]   And you could put them on your phone. They have an app for the uh for it and listen
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:02.000]   But there you know the quality may vary because it's it's done by you know regular people anybody can create a guide
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:06.880]   But boy, I think what I we did some paid audio guides in hawaiian
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:11.280]   It was a great way to travel around without having to pay for a an official guide
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:18.640]   Um, this looks really really cool. So I will add this to your pick izi.travel
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:24.400]   And uh, there is an app as well google and uh and ios and windows phone
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:31.520]   Hey, I don't know it says download from the windows phone store. I'll get that nooka 10 20
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:35.280]   What the hell maybe this is an old website. I don't know
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:39.440]   Uh, Jason snell now it's your time for the pick of a week
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:47.600]   All right really quickly we talked earlier about the new lock screen widgets on the new version of ios and so I want to recommend
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.400]   Widget smith which is a free app with an app purchase if you want to unlock some extra stuff like weather
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:57.200]   Forecast and all that it's from david smith very industrious ios developer
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:03.200]   It basically is custom widgets. That's what it does. It lets you do custom widgets on your home screen and now on your lock screen
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:07.760]   Uh, you get to control the look the color the pictures on little
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:13.520]   Lock screen widgets, but like all the things where you think I wonder if there's an app that makes widgets like this
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.800]   If you want to eliminate the search for an app in a particular category that makes that widget
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:26.240]   Widget smith almost certainly makes that widget whether it is a photo widget or a weather widget or a pedometer widget or you know
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:29.440]   You name it uh, david has come up with a widget for it
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:33.920]   It's a great app if you like having widgets on your home screen or you want to add new widgets
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:39.280]   To your lock screen. So check it out. It's free to try and then like I said unlock
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:44.960]   There's a subscription if you want to unlock some very specific data sources that require him to you know
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:50.000]   Subscribe to a data source like a weather source, you know, it's funny. I was looking at my subscriptions
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:54.560]   This is one of them trying to decide and I thought well, let me see how it works with ios 16
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.800]   Because I have been using it and I really like it
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:01.840]   Uh, and I wonder I bet it'll be even better with ios 16 right get those new widget types now
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:06.800]   So you can put custom widgets on your lock screen. Mm. Yeah, you know, i'm now i'm already
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:09.280]   Pissed off that I only could put two
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.120]   I want more you can more the circular ones you can fit more of the circular ones on because halide
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:20.800]   Uh has a circular one so I could put a halide on there. Let me let me look at this here
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:23.280]   So I I put long press
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:25.520]   Customize
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:29.520]   Where's the widget you got to tap on the widgets tap on the widgets
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:36.400]   And then here's if I scroll down here's halide, but this is like that's when you can drag on there
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.640]   Is that like a regular widget?
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.760]   And then what's cool. Look at this open halide open an auto mode open in manual mode
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:48.640]   Macro mode white camera ultra white camera telephoto camera
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:53.040]   So you can have widgets on here, but I can't just drag this to the lock screen
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.680]   Don't tell you delete you have to you have two rectangular widgets down there
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:59.120]   So that area is full you're gonna have to delete one of those widgets first
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:03.120]   Or make a new home screen with different widgets on it. Oh, that's right
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:09.680]   So I could have one when i'm using all trails and hiking that would also have halide on there as well
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:13.120]   You got it. Oh, man. Now you're getting it now. I'm getting it
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:18.000]   I'm gonna have screens galore and when i'm on so many locks so many locks screens
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:22.320]   You know this that justifies all the extra iPhones you're buying this year as well
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:25.600]   Be able to have all these extra screens for the extra
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.320]   God finds a way
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:32.960]   Uh so far i've only bought three one for me one for lays and one for mica
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:38.240]   Uh, but that may just be the tip of the iceberg if we have a lot of things next month
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:42.800]   Jason snell, thank you so much. I agree widget smith. Well
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:45.520]   Worth it. Uh, yeah
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:52.160]   Jason does the best stuff ever at six colors.com. It's a great site along with dan morn
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:54.800]   To uh to keep up on your apple
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:57.040]   fanboy
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:58.160]   info
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:02.400]   You're not an apple fanboy. I mean to say that but if you are an apple fanboy, you must read six colors
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.880]   Let's put it that way. Yeah, let's put it that way
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:12.880]   Uh, you also are uh, um a very uh prolific podcaster their podcast listed at six colors.com
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:16.640]   Um, including uh stuff on relay.fm
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:25.360]   Yep, thank you. Relay the incomparable so many other places. Love the yeah working a lot at six colors this uh this month. Good. Nice
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:34.400]   mr. Andi and naka when will you appear on wgph next i'm off this week, but i'm on uh next friday at
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:36.320]   1245
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:42.480]   For in the afternoon go to wgph news.org to stream it live or later or to check out the wgph youtube channel
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:49.680]   Which has which will have that live plus all my their previous like stuff doing for and look for andi at the opera october 6th
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:55.120]   Right after the maybe you'll even have a new pixel phone to shoot some pictures with
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.680]   I
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.040]   You know, I I hate to say it as a as a happy pixel six owner
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:05.680]   If I have a if I had a new pixel seven in my hand, but I also have like a new iphone in the other hand like
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.440]   Maybe I don't you know, I only have two weeks with this
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:16.720]   But this iPhone yeah, it's like uh, you don't need to eat. I know I hate I hate temptation you're supposed to resist it
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.400]   That's the least fun part and he does talk about
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:28.800]   Android things with florin saiyan in his material podcast at relay dot f m and Alex lindsey
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:31.840]   He's easy to find just go to office hours dot global
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.080]   Which is a 24 hour fest of stuff
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.280]   The big morning show is the one you want to check out this show today was on budget
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.560]   Audio solutions which is kind of it turned out to be really good
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:50.640]   It was yeah, we were really just talking about lots of less expensive things that you can use and what to what to think about when you're buying less expensive
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:52.320]   Than more expensive so nice
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:58.880]   And we by the way, if you're interested in the zoom I so thing that we did we grilled the part of the engineering team on saturday at ibc
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:00.880]   They they came in live
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.960]   From their booth at ibc and we asked them a ton of questions. Oh, there's also an iBC
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.960]   coverage there which
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:13.920]   Took it to it. You know, we've done a lot of conferences the ibc coverage that we did was kind of fun because we
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:21.360]   You know, we were doing live like going to people's booths and having panelists in zoom asking them questions. Oh, that's really neat
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.680]   What a great idea
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.160]   As I didn't think it was gonna work like I got like the guys were like we got this idea. We're gonna do this thing
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.160]   I'm like I go ahead
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:30.960]   You know
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:35.920]   I go ahead do it and and they did it. It was kind of magical. So you're you really this is really a
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:41.360]   Laboratory for the future media. Oh, it's me. I mean, it's really impressive what you're doing
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:44.160]   I mean, it's it's watching with interest at all times
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:49.680]   It's the whole community and i'm doing less and less every day and they're doing more and more and they're and they are I mean
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:52.560]   It's just incredible think tank of people that are
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:56.000]   Experimenting we're using things like ibc will probably use nab
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:01.040]   New York next and as how do we do a live coverage of a given location?
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:07.600]   But also office hours every day is a lab because we've got anywhere from three or four people up to 20 that are managing
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:12.960]   managing the back end not even on the front end that are experimenting we're constantly developing it like we
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:19.280]   The zoom ISO thing we're gonna have one of the problems is when you're trying to test zoom ISO is who is in this in the window
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.880]   Right like who's in the windows?
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:27.680]   So we we built an event that we recorded that we can loop so we can loop 12 people at a time into a zoom room
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:33.840]   And anybody who wants to between one and three in the afternoon can just go in with their zoom ISO and just grab on to some of these
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.720]   And it's an actual conversation and you can make sure that all your you know your systems are working and um
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:44.000]   And so that's uh, it's a lot of fun. So it's it's a pretty fun community
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:51.280]   All I could say is go to office hours dot global find out how you can be participate you can always watch but you can also which is really cool
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:53.600]   uh participate
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.760]   Um, I also I did by the way. I've decided on shows. I started doing like some comment. I decided to just hand to mid journey
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:08.800]   And just say, ah, I love that you create so we have the dynamic island. So I just put dynamic island in there you go. That's dynamic. Oh, it's beautiful
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:14.160]   I want to go there. I know I know there's like here's another version of it's a little a little bit more swimming
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:20.160]   The journey is one of these ai uh art generators. It's got a discord channel. So you can do it right in discord
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:27.440]   That's yeah, so I yeah threw a couple of them in there. I thought it'd be that it'd be fun. It's as we experiment with the the our overlords
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:31.600]   It seems like I saw Ben you know, it's wild Ben Thompson
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.880]   Uh, as jatekari was using, uh mid journey or is it yeah, I think it was mid journey
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:42.720]   To uh, us that can't get into dolly or yeah, exactly. I forget did I say that no
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.000]   Forget is what I was saying forget dolly too
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:52.240]   Because you can now use a stable diffusion, which is mind boggling on your own hardware
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:57.840]   And if you don't have that kind of hardware mid journey, this is this is a stratekari
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:04.080]   He you know, he's obviously playing with it. My first job was a paper boy, but there's something about the art
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:10.800]   Created by this that is just fascinating to me. It's just it's a lot of fun because you're playing with it
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.960]   And it you know people will say well, it's just the ai but it's not it's how you type it in
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:18.320]   It is it's programming like what I just showed you that's the new kind of programming
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:22.960]   That's the what I just the textures. I showed you are a hundred iterations in yeah, I was just doing it all day
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:27.840]   I mean while we were talking. I just I just hit go go go. Yeah, you're really coding. Go go go. Yeah, you're really coding
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:28.880]   Yeah, yeah
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:32.400]   It's just when you see the next generation of these kind of apps where you can say okay
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:36.960]   But I want there to be more fallout on the on the on the ground there
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:41.440]   I want the paint there to be a little bit rougher make it flakier than say I want you to
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:45.120]   I want to do this as an old painting, but I want a really heavy impostor on it
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:49.120]   And that's just just like just like you said when it becomes
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:52.960]   You go from manipulating paint to manipulating an algorithm
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:57.040]   I don't see the difference between create that in actual and legitimate creative art
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:02.000]   Alex send us that dynamic island. We'll use it as our thumbnail okay for the show
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:07.840]   I'll see if I get one every we'll do one for the shows, you know, so the uh, yeah, the you know, you have
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:14.400]   This is what I really want. Alex and the leo and jason at dynamic island
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:18.160]   You guys are gonna have to work on that in photos
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:22.720]   Okay, but I do think that the ai is you know to me it feels very much like synthesizers
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.960]   You know and when we said oh well those aren't really you know and people create incredible music with them
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:32.320]   And but they're doing a lot of the stuff for you and this is kind of building on that. So it's a lot of fun
