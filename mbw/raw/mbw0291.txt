[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.960]   And there is quite a bit of it.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.080]   Let's start to my left Andy Anatko is here from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.520]   joined by three lovely comic book characters.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.880]   Good to see you, Andrew.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.120]   >> Happy St. Patrick's Day of few days late.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.280]   Do you go out and do you dress, you could dress credibly as a leprechaun, I believe.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.200]   >> Well, two problems with that, A, I'm a little bit too tall and B as a freelance
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.960]   journalist, I have no part of gold.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.640]   Also, no, I have no part of gold.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.000]   >> You have an imaginary part of gold, though, that qualifies you.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.320]   My part of gold is my talent and I'm still looking forward to the basis.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.560]   >> Nice.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   >> Nice to press.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.480]   >> Nice to see you.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   Hello.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.240]   Also with us, we should mention Alex Lindsey is probably never going to be on
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.960]   this show again.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.320]   The man, which is for him is a great thing, and I'm just jesting, of course he will,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.760]   but he is traveling like a mother.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.560]   I saw him two days ago, I said, Alex, you're in town, he said just for today.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.320]   And where is he now?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.000]   I don't, he's in London.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080]   >> Today is in Chicago.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.640]   >> Chicago.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.880]   >> Yeah, deep dish.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.800]   Kenny, he's got work happening right now.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   >> He, well, I mean, it's good.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.880]   He's at what, you know, because of Pixelcore, he's an independent production guy and he gets
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   a lot of work, so you can't knock it, but at the same time we miss you, Alex.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.720]   We miss you.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   So we are very glad in his place to have the wonderful rich Segal, who is the kind of
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.640]   original with his parrot, Bruno.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.680]   Is that Bruno Mars?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   >> That's Bruno D. Bird demands to be in frame and he actually gets paid scale for it.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> Uh-oh, I'll send you a check.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.640]   >> He costs me a lot of money.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.200]   Which is one of the great Mac developers, bare-bones software, of course, creators of
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.520]   BB Edit, Yo-Jimbo.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   What else?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   >> Text Wrangler.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   >> Text Wrangler, which is the now free version of BB Edit, basically.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.680]   >> That's right, and that pretty much rounds out our line.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   >> You did an email package for a little etsy-weatsy bit.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120]   >> Yeah, for a while we had an email client that actually got spun out, I've been sort
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.160]   of maintaining it on an informal basis, just keeping it working well enough for me to use.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   That was Male Smith.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   >> Male Smith, I loved Male Smith.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   >> Oh, it's still around.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   I'm still using it.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   It still works.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.400]   >> I think that's one of the things about Rich's stuff, is it develops devoted, hardcore
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.080]   fans who would just say, "I will use nothing else."
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.240]   >> Oh, fear keeps everyone out of mind.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.200]   Anyway, really glad to have you, because I do like to get into the developer's perspective
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   from time to time.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.120]   Apple, in its relationships with the developers, are always a little bit interesting, and worldwide
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   developers' conferences is coming up, and there's lots to talk about.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.520]   So thank you for being here, Mr. Strykel.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   >> Thanks for having me, Mr. LePore.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.120]   >> So I guess we should start with the biggest story, which was a very, I think, unprecedented
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   thing for Apple.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   Tim Cook's been doing this more.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.800]   This is his second analyst call.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.240]   He announced, I think they announced this on Thursday, that they were going to have an
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   analyst call on Friday?
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   Or was it, no, Sunday they were going to have it on Monday, so it was yesterday, that they
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:57.160]   were going to 6 a.m., Pacific Time, 9 a.m., Eastern Time, speak about, speak to the $100
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   billion surplus, and what we're going to do with it, and what they're going to do with
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.760]   it, they announced, is to offer a dividend for the first time in history, $2.65 per share
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.920]   dividend distributed each quarter, starting with the company's fourth fiscal quarter in
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:25.720]   2012, that begins July 1st, and spend a significant amount of money on buying stock back.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   Andy, what's a buyback?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   I don't understand.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.360]   >> Usually, it's a sign that the company's investing in itself, with someone on Twitter
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.680]   reminded me of a great quote that when a company does a buyback, it's often referred to as
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.280]   buying back their soul, because they want to take shares of stock out of the stockholders'
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.040]   hands and back into their own coffers, where they can control more of the company and actually
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   be more of a participant in their own future.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.120]   During the call, though, Tim Cook said that the specific point of that, though, was to
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.880]   offset the effects of all the stock options that were going to be coming into play for
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.920]   a certain sum of their employees and executives in the near future.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.360]   So it's not quite the investment in Apple's future.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.800]   Their future's already pretty locked in.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.400]   >> Boy, I'm no finance whiz, so I'm going to try to see if I can paraphrase what's going
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   on.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   >> Yeah, I did.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.280]   >> And if I get it wrong, Rich and Andy, you beat me over the head.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.320]   So a company goes to the equity markets, the financial markets, with a public offering
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.680]   in order to raise money, they take a certain percentage of the company.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.400]   Doesn't always have to be a significant percentage.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.240]   In Facebook's case, it's not, for instance.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   But say, let's say, 5, 10, 50, whatever, percent of the company, and they sell shares
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.000]   up to that amount.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.080]   They set a starting stock price, which is the amount of money they're going to get.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.320]   And then ever after the stock market trades those shares back and forth, and the price
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   goes up.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   So I don't know what Apple's IPO, which was many moons ago.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.360]   I don't know what their strike price was, their original price.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   But they got the cash, and that was it.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   There's the money.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.200]   Here's your packet of money, and now shares of the company are out there, and people
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.680]   trade it back and forth, and the stock price goes up, up, up, up, up.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.800]   Now Apple, of course, retains some shares, stuff they didn't put on the market, and those
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.640]   shares they can give to employees as options, bonuses, or grants.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.920]   Option means an option to buy at a certain price.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.560]   If I go to work for Apple, and the Apple stock price is $600, usually that's my what
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   they could call strike price, they give me a thousand shares priced at $600.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.040]   If the stock continues to go up, and this is the idea to incentive an employee stock
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.080]   will go up, then I can sell those $600 shares for the new, let's say, $700 price, and I
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.840]   will get the total price of the option plus the growth.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   So that's good.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.960]   If it goes down, then the amount of the grant in effect goes down.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.440]   So it's an incentive program.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   There's options.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   There's grants.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.360]   So when these employees take this stock and start to pump it in the market, that dilutes
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.960]   the total number of shares out there.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.480]   It increases the number of shares out there.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.840]   And so this buyback would be, in effect, Apple buying its own stock, the stock that
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.560]   they sold originally for what $40 a share, I don't remember what the strike price was,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.200]   but $40 a share at this new $600 rate.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.880]   So they're paying out some good money, but the idea is now there are fewer shares on
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.960]   the market, so this effect of the employees cashing in their options is mitigated.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.240]   It also, as you said, Andy, it has a psychological effect on the market because if a company spends
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.720]   the current stock price for shares in its company, it's essentially saying, "We think
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.520]   we're worth more, or at least more."
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.800]   I was talking to one of my C&I nerds about this.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.840]   These are the people who know a lot more than I do about it.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.800]   Something I know very little about, and this is the business of these stock transactions.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.760]   And he was telling me that on a younger company, there are two reasons for a company buy itself
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.960]   back, either because they know that their stock is currently undervalued and that they
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.400]   themselves can really add a lot of value to their own company.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.880]   That will really be a good investment for themselves to simply say, "We want to take
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.040]   some shares off the floor for a while."
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:14.400]   Another one is that if you believe that these stockholders in some way or another have a
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.520]   little bit too much power over your decisions, you might as an ongoing basis if your coffers
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   are blessed to say, "You know what?
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.600]   We want to take more of our company out of public hands and make the private again."
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Right.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   I would say you're going to buy out yourselves completely.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.440]   But obviously, it's overall, it really is a statement that we are a company that's really
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   moving forward.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.240]   We not only are successful, but we have the resources to control our own destiny a little
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   bit more.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.560]   In a company like Apple, though, and this is something that someone was explaining to
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.360]   me, neither of those are really operative, so it really does come down to what does it
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.240]   look like when so many employees start to see their value of their options rise and rise
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   and rise at some point.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   Right.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.040]   I'm going to say it's time to not work five days a week.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.880]   Well, imagine if you joined Apple even just four or five years ago and your strike price
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.840]   on your, you know, you've got a thousand options, your strike price was 40 bucks, and now it's
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.400]   600 bucks, that means you're going to realize a significant amount of money, $600,000.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.800]   Yeah, that's tempting.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   That's really tempting.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   I can understand that.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.720]   In some cases, you're right, it would be a case of saying, "I want a bigger say in what's
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   going on.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.920]   I don't want so many stockholders to tell me what to do."
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.600]   But Apple isn't going to ever buy enough stock back to get a significant percentage of its
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   company back.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.200]   You're going to have shareholders no matter what.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.520]   The other thing that was surprising to me that we didn't know, we always knew that Apple
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.600]   had $100 billion in cash.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.080]   What we didn't know is that most of that is held by overseas affiliates or subsidiaries.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.000]   Boy, I'll tell you, I know nothing about finance.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Is this that Irish sandwich thing that Google was using?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.040]   There's another sandwich job.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.920]   So Peter Oppenheimer has the CFO said that repatriating the cash from offshore will result
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.400]   in significant tax consequences.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.680]   What Google does, and I guess Apple's been doing this as well, is by pumping some of
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.520]   its profits into, say, Ireland where there's no corporate tax, they save corporate tax
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.680]   in the US.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.640]   So Google, for instance, created an Irish subsidiary, licensed, gave the subsidiary all
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:41.520]   of its patents and licenses them back in the US, then the money gets pumped into Ireland
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.000]   where there's no corporate tax.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.360]   Woohoo, then there's an even more complicated transaction that goes on through the Canary
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.720]   Islands and there's all sorts of stuff they do.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   This is US companies do this all the time to avoid corporate taxes.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:05.120]   Presumably, I'm guessing that's why $64 billion out of the 100 is held outside the US.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.080]   But we're going to bring it back to buy these stocks and that's going to be a big tax consequence.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   Good.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.560]   All I can say is, yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.920]   Isaac Asimov had that saying that any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.960]   magic, any significantly advanced money was indistinguishable from crime.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   But you realize that there are a lot of people making sure that this at least is technically
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   legal.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.560]   So I'm sorry, I got that wrong.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.720]   The cash that they're going to use for the dividend buyback, the $45 billion is just
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   Apple's US money.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.880]   So they're not going to repatriate.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   I apologize.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.120]   They decided not to because of the tax consequences.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   That's correct.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:53.080]   And when there is that much money involved and the tax consequences just sort of go sky
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   high and it makes sense for them to avoid coughing up the taxes until they really, really,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   really need to.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.880]   It worries me a little bit then because they're going to spend pretty much all the cash that
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880]   they have in the bank today.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.720]   Of course, they'll have more by the end of this buyback, but they're going to spend $45
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.160]   billion is like the total US cash reserve.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.640]   Yeah, but what's left over is still enough that if they won't, yeah.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.600]   Well, there's actually a couple of considerations there.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.120]   One is that they're not coughing at all up all at once.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560]   There's they're doing this over time.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.000]   So they'll make more money.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.400]   And they'll make more money and actually the rate at which I forget where I saw this
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.840]   somebody did the math, but the rate at which they're making money is actually going to
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.760]   exceed the rate which they spend.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.080]   So they're going to end up with more money in the banks anyway.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.200]   So they're going to end up with a suitable cash reserve amount.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   Exactly.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   That's what Tim Cook said.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   He said, don't worry.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   We got plenty.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   We got nothing.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   I got a guy.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.360]   You know what was fun though is when Sunday when we got news that they were going to have
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   this conference was the speculation what would what you know, everybody said, oh, they're
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   going to do a dividend.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.800]   But if they didn't, what would they do?
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.640]   Somebody said buy Canada.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.120]   That's a good idea.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.320]   You could buy Twitter.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.040]   You could buy the entire music industry.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.040]   You could.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.360]   I mean, there's a lot you could do with that money.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.600]   And I guess they're still going to have it.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.200]   So there you go.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:30.000]   The other news from this analyst call, Tim Cook said that iPad had a record weekend.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.800]   The most sales of any first weekend of any of the three iPads.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.960]   And I think I saw a figure and I don't know if it came from Tim Cook or from an analyst,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.760]   but that they had sold what was it?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.840]   Two and a half or three million iPads in the first four days.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.880]   Yeah, that's what we were predicting last week for the first.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.120]   We were a little at a at a line.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.280]   I know you were the one that was closest, Andy.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.440]   It was well, also what's unusual to me is not just simply the number of units that they
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.760]   sold, but the fact that I think this is the first iPad release where they seem to have
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.320]   managed to have anticipated supply correctly.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.160]   Yes, you can still walk into an Apple store and buy one, right?
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   Can't buy.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.840]   Can't buy 30 of them, but you can't get your hold on hold of them.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.040]   Also, I've been talking to people who place their orders online who are promised that,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.840]   oh, we won't be able to send this to you for another two or three weeks and it are two
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.840]   weeks earlier.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.840]   Oh, that's good.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.000]   I don't know who's doing what, but they figured something out at Apple.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.080]   We had heard that they were we heard in November that the manufacturing at RE ramped up for
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   the iPad three.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.000]   This kind of might confirm that now.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   They've been cranking them out for months.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.680]   Yeah, and as usual, we'll see the first we've already seen the first wave of, oh, the screen's
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.600]   a little bit yellow while they're going to be yellow because they need time to cure.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.880]   I didn't see a problem.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   Did you have it?
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   Have you seen that?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.560]   It was a little bit yellow, but only if I put it side by side against iPad two just
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   for some, but it's already starting to fade a little bit.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   It's the glue, right?
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.520]   It's not it's the glue has to cure.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.520]   It's curing time that takes I think the last time I checked was like two and a half, three
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.720]   weeks, something like that too.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.320]   For for it's completely stable the way it's going to be.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.480]   But yeah, that's fortunately we've had the iPad one and the iPad two.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.320]   So now we can really segregate what is something that we can expect from a brand new versus
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.680]   what is hey, this is different.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.040]   Why is this now acting so strange?
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.280]   AT&T claimed the new iPad set a new single day device activation record for those who
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.480]   bought AT&T's beating that set by the iPhone 4S locked last October.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.960]   The iPhone 4S did sell four million units in its launch weekend.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.080]   So this is a record for the iPad, but not a record for Apple.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.040]   You predicted what Andy two and a half.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.760]   I think I think I was said for the first week it would go closer to eight.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   I remember.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.120]   I said I think 15, which is in, you know, Apple says we might sell 14 this quarter.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.120]   So I think we were just I was anyways, I'll take the fall.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.200]   I was swept up in iPad mania.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.440]   You're rushing as well.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.600]   That's what Apple sells.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   That's what he does that that causes people to spend $500 for a device that even people
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.880]   like us cannot cannot say in two sentences what the iPad is for.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.800]   Rich, I'm figuring you bought an iPad.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.560]   I don't know what to call it.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   The new iPad.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.520]   I have one one right here.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.720]   You surprised me because you said that you this is an upgrade from the iPad one.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.360]   You skipped the two.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah, I skipped the two.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.360]   The two is a very nice machine.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.960]   But it, you know, I looked at it and it wasn't enough nicer than what I had to make me want
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.920]   to run out and buy one.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.440]   So I waited and I'm honestly glad I did because if I hadn't, I would have had to skip this
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   one.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   This is a very nice machine.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.680]   It's a great upgrade from my first gen iPad, which was starting to feel kind of a little
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.920]   sluggish and slow when I was using it in weird places to like keyboard input was lacking.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.400]   So what was it that put you over the top for this one?
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.720]   I think it was the combination of the improvements coming from the iPad two.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.480]   I mean, it was a little slimmer than the iPad one.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   It was easier to hold comfortably.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   The screen was just sort of the icing on the cake.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.600]   You look at this thing in person and the screen really, really does sell it.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.560]   And you know, I got the same size.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.680]   I got a Wi-Fi only like my iPad one.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.800]   So you know, really it's pretty much strictly a functional upgrade.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.440]   And I'm really enjoying it so far.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.360]   The text in iBooks is just ridiculously easy to read now.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.960]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.680]   Somebody on Twitter that I follow, I forget who at the moment made an observation that
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.080]   you can actually dim the screen a little bit lower than you could with previous generations
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.280]   of iPads.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.200]   I've noticed that as well and it's great for nighttime use.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.280]   I make my text smaller too.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.520]   I opened the Kindle app and my text was gigantic, which it had to be, I guess, on the iPad
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520]   too.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.800]   And so I made it smaller and it's nice.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.880]   I get more on the screen.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.920]   We'll talk more about the new iPad with Rich Segal of bare bone software, Andy Naco of
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.480]   the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.160]   And of course, lots more news to come before we go any further though.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.960]   Can I mention our friends at the Florida Motor Company?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.800]   I drove my Mustang here and every time.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.920]   In fact, I posted a picture on Twitter.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:43.160]   My son, I wonder if I can find this, my son has a unique seat position when I drive him
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   to school.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.280]   He leans the seat all the way back.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.560]   And it gets comfortable, which I have to say I quite admire his relaxation.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.720]   Let me see if I can find this picture.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.000]   A lot of people said, "What is that car?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.800]   The seats look really nice.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.640]   They are."
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.880]   That's my 2010 Ford Mustang.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.560]   That's Henry's seat position.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.920]   And of course, he's got the first thing he does, he gets in the car and my phone is
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.160]   mated to the Ford Sync.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.360]   First thing he does is he knows now it's a three button push to take over the audio
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.680]   system from his iPhone and start blasting the beats.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.160]   So the car is...
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.000]   And he's leaning back like this.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.440]   What a life that kid has.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.760]   The life of a 17 year old.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:41.880]   And if you look closely, the picture of me next to this is my reaction to all of this.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.800]   My head on the table.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.440]   I say all this because I love my Ford.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.320]   And you know, Henry wants to drive the Mustang, but I'm going to wait.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.880]   I'm going to get him one of the new Ford.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.160]   He's not going to like me for this.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.400]   Taurus is because of the curve control, because of the systems in the Ford to make it a safer
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   car.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.200]   For instance, the curve control will keep him from, as he would I know in my Mustang,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   steering off the road.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.600]   A hundred times a second Ford's car computer looks at...
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.880]   Listen to this, roll rate, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, wheel speed and steering angle.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.240]   The whole idea is to figure out how quickly the vehicle is turning versus how quickly Henry
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.200]   is trying to turn it.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.320]   And if he's trying to turn it faster than it can turn, what's going to happen, the whole
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.520]   thing is going to break away.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280]   The curve control prevents that.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.600]   It just can't happen.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.120]   It's the same kind of improvement that anti-lock brakes transformed, how we break.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.320]   And it just does it automatically.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.240]   We're all used to it now.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.520]   Every car is going to, I would hope, would have this, but right now Ford's got it.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Rapidly reduces engine torque.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.240]   The minute it sees the problem, applies four wheel braking.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.680]   It can slow the vehicle up to 10 miles an hour per second.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.080]   Wet or dry, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.600]   This keeps you on the road.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.320]   You should see the difference.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.360]   Your car drives like one of those sure-footed donkeys at the Grand Canyon.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   You just can't go off the road.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.320]   It's so amazing.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.480]   You can find out more at Ford.com/cars/taurus.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.680]   When you're there, take a look at everything else, the EcoBoost engine, the adaptive cruise
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.720]   control, the collision avoidance systems.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.280]   This is what a 21st century car should be.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.600]   And there is no company leading the pack like Ford.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   Really doing amazing stuff.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   I'm not surprised.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.760]   These guys are engineering driven technology focused.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   Take a look.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:46.040]   Drive the 2013 Ford Taurus at a Ford dealer near you today or visit Ford.com/cars/taurus
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.640]   and learn more about curve control.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:57.320]   And if you have a 2010 Mustang, not a bad idea to lean the seat back and relax, but
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   only if you're not driving.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   Dad's sitting bolt upright.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   You know what?
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   He took...
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.200]   I want to ask you about this.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.640]   He took... he's taking driving... he's learning how to drive.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   Driver's training.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   I'm so scared.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.200]   And the driver's training people said, "No, 10 and 2 is not how you should hold the wheel.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   That's old.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.600]   We now hold it down here at... what is it?
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.800]   Five and seven."
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.960]   When did that happen?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:33.240]   It's apparently... they said if you crash and your airbags go off, your arms will break
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.160]   and it's ergonomically better, which I've always thought because it's hard to hold your hands
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.920]   like this forever.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.600]   And it keeps you from oversteering.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.960]   See, they always taught us 10 and 2 because you could...
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.600]   But I guess in the days of power steering, it doesn't matter anymore.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   So the stick uses 9 and 3.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   Really?
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.640]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.440]   9 and 3.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.960]   But those are like performance drivers.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.440]   Yeah, and there's no way I can hold the wheel there because there's a big bar.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.080]   So okay, it's close to 9 and 3.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   It's just underneath the line.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   It's really...
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.960]   Leo, what I want to know is whether that fancy car of yours sends you an SMS every time your
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.240]   kid's driving and the skid control kicks in.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.720]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:18.080]   You know, it does... all the modern cars now have a... I didn't know this, but they have
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.440]   a little dock underneath the dashboard for you to put these car computers in.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.920]   And you absolutely can get devices after the third party aftermarket devices that you plug
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.600]   in that will monitor all of that.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   I have one in my car that totally changed the way I drive.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.480]   I get real-time data on my engine performance and my MPG.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.960]   And I think I actually made it a pick of the week.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.480]   It's called the Scan Plus.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   That's it.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   And it's just...
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.000]   I keep marveling at the fact that all my life I've known the reasons for driving for
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.320]   driving efficiently and you'll save money on gas.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.520]   That had... and it's actually safer driving so you won't get killed probably.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.680]   That had no...
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   You'll save wear and tear in your engine.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   That had no effect.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.720]   But if you put a little thing on my dash, it gave me a score that I could try to beat
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   every time.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   So congratulations.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.920]   You drove much more like a weenie than you did the last time you were driving on this
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920]  ...
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   I'll...
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.720]   Now, you don't have kids, Rich, do you?
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.440]   Have a 14-year-old house.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   Perfect.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440]   Okay.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   So this is... this...
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.680]   Ford does have this my key thing.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's a special key for the teenager.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.120]   But it ensures that, for instance, the belt-minder warning continues to chime.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.080]   You know, it goes off after a certain amount of time.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   No.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.840]   When you're using the teenager key, it keeps ringing.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   The audio sound system remains muted until the safety belts are buckled.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.680]   No sound for you.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.200]   You can use the my key to set limits on speed.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.160]   The maximum volume of the audio system.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.840]   My favorite thing about the Ford Mikey is the low fuel light comes on sooner.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.040]   75 miles too empty.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.600]   Because teenagers will drive to the bitter end.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   I know.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   I was a teenager.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.000]   In fact, Henry got back from Santa Barbara.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I don't know how he did this.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.680]   He and his friends drove down to Santa Barbara and back.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.240]   He left the car.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.200]   I think he left the car with a thimble full...
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.840]   I've never seen it so empty.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.000]   And I don't know how he timed it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.840]   So they must have said, "Okay, let's calculate exactly how much gas it will take to get back
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   from Santa Barbara.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.640]   Put that much in and no more!"
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   It was like the car.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.120]   If I pulled it out of the driveway, it would run out of gas.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.120]   I've never seen it.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   It was amazing.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   So the...
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.880]   I think at that point, maybe you solved the problem by just having the kid push the
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.080]   car to the air gas station.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   Henry, come here.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.480]   You and your friends, I got a job for you.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.840]   Oh, anyway, moving along.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.960]   Andy and I were on Trey Radcliffe's variety hour, Trey's variety hour last night talking
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   about...
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.920]   Among other things, iPad photography.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.200]   And I think Andy thinks I'm nuts, but I love the camera in the eye.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.360]   I knew iPad so much.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.000]   That's how I took that picture, by the way, of the Ford.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.680]   That I've been using it for everything lately.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.760]   And I'm just a huge fan.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.840]   I got to admit that I have two problems with it.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:16.240]   I might have been turned around on it slightly this morning because I was out to breakfast.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.520]   I was ordering a waffles.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.360]   And the idea of taking pictures and seeing an eight-
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.760]   Yeah, baby!
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   Yeah, baby!
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   That'd be cool.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.400]   As a matter of fact, this kind of looked better even because it was...
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.640]   Makes me hungry.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   At the actual waffles.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.480]   My problem is that, number one, there is no way to take pictures like this and not
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.400]   look like the biggest dork in Stein.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.120]   There's the problems of using...
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.880]   There are inherent problems always with using the iPad and Bright Sunlight.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   And so that means that when I was taking pictures over the weekend, it was a nice bright sunny
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.040]   day, which meant that there's so much glare coming off of this huge piece of polished
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.120]   glass that I really couldn't see what I was aiming at.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.240]   Also the sun was washing up the screen, so I really couldn't see what I was aiming at.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.440]   And thirdly, when I'm taking...
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.720]   It seems as though it's in many ways the worst of both worlds.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.320]   There, if I really want to go out and take good pictures, I'll have my real camera with
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   me.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.560]   And it takes incredibly good pictures.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.240]   It's inconvenient because I have to like, you know, carry it around a strap, but it takes
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.520]   great pictures.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.480]   If I'm just taking casual pictures, I use my iPhone and that's great because I can just
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.560]   simply carry it in my pocket, take it up, take a picture, then put it back in my pocket.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.840]   With the iPad, I've got not great picture taking, or at least not great compared to
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.040]   a real camera.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.160]   And I've got all the convenience of this big bulky thing.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.600]   Unless I want to walk around with this big like $500, $800 object that screams to people,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   "Hi, can you grab this and run faster than me?
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.320]   Have a free iPad."
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:57.480]   Well, one thing I do is that you see my case is a sun hood because I have a case with
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   a lid.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.040]   So in order to take the picture, if you fold the lid over, it covers the camera.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.160]   So in order to make sure you have to do it this way.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.880]   And as it turns out, it really does block the glare very nicely.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.640]   In fact, Alan Tepper, the ProVideo Coalition magazine and website wrote an article saying,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.400]   "This is the new 4x5 view camera."
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.000]   Because remember in the old days of photographers, they've had a hood over their head?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.040]   The Kickstarter project wanted to sell that.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   It clips on magnetically.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   Yes.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   It's a pretty cosplay.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   Yes.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   Let's see.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.800]   I think you kind of proved me my point.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   You're not looking.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.880]   I don't care.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   Look at this picture.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.880]   This is a...
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.560]   So it's also the camera you have, right?
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.720]   So there was a bunny out by the truck the other day.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   Not my truck, of course.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.200]   Mine would be a Ford F-150.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:50.000]   But I said that cute bunny and I didn't have my Canon 5D Mark II with a telephoto lens,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.840]   which I would have liked.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.480]   I only had my iPad.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.720]   But I think I snapped a pretty great little shot there.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.920]   That's filtered a little bit with Instagram.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   It's not with the original.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.960]   It actually was a little bit more natural color.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   The color is very good.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.160]   The clarity is very good.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.760]   It doesn't have...
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.720]   It's not wide angle or zoom, so you miss out on...
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.280]   It's like having a fixed prime lens.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.880]   By the way, the bunny tasted fabulous just if people were asking.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.720]   A little bit like chicken.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   It takes pictures that are about as good as the iPhone 4, the 5 megapixel camera.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.680]   It's just that I'm going to have my real iPhone 4 with me.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.480]   So that's a problem.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.640]   It's a much better camera, I think, for shooting video than anything else.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.200]   That's when you're shooting video, you are just standing...
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.600]   You're not taking out a video camera, snapping a second video and putting it back in.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.400]   You really are just actively shooting.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.960]   When you do this video and you don't have to import it, you don't have to do anything
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.040]   to it is just there, an iMovie can start editing it immediately, that's pretty hot.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   I agree.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.480]   That's one of the reasons I like it, even for stills, is I've got iPhoto, which I'm starting
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.840]   to really like.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.280]   Tough learning curve, but I'm starting to get it.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.840]   I can upload it immediately.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   I've got 3G so even out in the field.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.440]   To me photography has become much more of a social thing thanks to Instagram and Facebook
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.160]   and Path.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.120]   I don't take pictures just for the real or the role or for my album.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.640]   I take them to post them, almost always.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.280]   Very rarely do I take them and not post them.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.840]   Those are only the butt pictures, I save those.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.400]   I could have gone my entire life.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   I know.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   I'm sorry, Rich.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.000]   I apologize.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.400]   I blame myself.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.480]   Did you get AT&T of a rise in Rich?
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.080]   I actually got a Wi-Fi only iPad, but my iPhone is an AT&T iPhone.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.200]   You use that as a hotspot then?
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.520]   Is that why you didn't feel the need?
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.920]   No, it's just that for the way I operate nowadays, I find that whenever I'm out and
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.720]   about, if I have my iPad, I tend to be someplace where there's Wi-Fi.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.360]   I went back and forth on that and I ended up because it's a company iPad.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   I said, "Well, I'm going to buy it."
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.520]   I think you probably could.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.920]   Nowadays, everybody's around Wi-Fi almost all the time.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.320]   You lose the GPS.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.680]   Maybe that's not an issue.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   Which I haven't missed.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.960]   Plus, I do have the iPhone.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.000]   If I'm someplace where there's no Wi-Fi, I'll fire up the iPhone and do what I need to
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.520]   do.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:28.880]   That said, I did have a couple of second thoughts about, did I make the right decision not getting
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.760]   the 4G on the iPad?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.480]   I'm thinking probably for now.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.080]   Eventually maybe my next iPad will be a 4G iPad.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.760]   I think so far so good.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.560]   People who have Verizon LTE are reporting astounding speeds, like 50 megabits down,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.280]   15 megabits up.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.960]   I don't know.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.040]   It's almost overkill.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.400]   It's not like you're downloading giant applications.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   Huh?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.600]   Is that, are you quoting that actually, 5-0 or 15?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.680]   5-0 down, both MGC.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.800]   The report of that in San Francisco and somebody just mentioned it that his friend in Portland
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.280]   is getting 50 down, 49 megabits down.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.680]   Oh, wait, see, now that's my 5-0's connection right there.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   Exactly.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.240]   But on the other hand, if you only buy 3 gigabytes a month, you're going to go through
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   that.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   Look at he split.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.600]   Well, but still, that will only come into play if you're doing lots of streaming.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.320]   But if you're still a typical user, you're still going to be getting pictures just the
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.160]   same transaction only will get it faster.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.000]   But this is the reason why that's a good one.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.400]   When I buy my iPad 3, it is going to be an LTE model because there's something about
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.720]   a tablet computer that to have an implicit connection to the internet really does change
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   the device.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.800]   Even if you just have to wait exactly 10 seconds to log into a public Wi-Fi, that really
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.080]   does change the experience a little bit.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.880]   Also, I'm so aware that there's so many times when I just can't find Wi-Fi or good public
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:08.480]   Wi-Fi, I have to say that unfortunately, the Panera up the street has lost its license
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.560]   as a venue for my working out of the house because not only is the Wi-Fi terrible, even
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:20.680]   the HSPA+ on the AT&T mode without LTE is faster than its own Wi-Fi.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:26.280]   Then they increased the price with soda by 15 cents.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.600]   Now that I have a 4G iPad though, now if I want to, I can work at the Chipotle.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.000]   I can work at all these.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.200]   I can work at the Dunkin Donuts with the terrible Wi-Fi.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.120]   Oh, you don't mean get a job at the Chipotle.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.600]   Things aren't that tough.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   You meant I can get work done.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.880]   It's a great franchise.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.440]   It really depends on your use case.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.520]   So Rich may only go to the same two places all the time and they both have good Wi-Fi.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.480]   The bar and my study.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   Exactly.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.440]   He works at homes.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.040]   If you spend time at airports, random airports across the country or you're on construction
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.760]   sites or whatever you need and you need access, I could see it.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.960]   What's good is we're getting great performance.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.920]   Even the AT&T model, I was getting the highest I got was about 12 megabits.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.360]   On average, it was about 7 or 8.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's what I reported in my review.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.280]   But yeah, it's not a trivial upgrade.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   No, amazing.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.160]   How's battery life when you're using LTE?
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.240]   People are reporting about one hour, less than nine hours.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   It's constant.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.560]   It's quite a bit with what you get on 3G.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:40.560]   So if I'm using LTE exclusively, it was burning at about 30 to 40 percent faster than it would
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.760]   without LTE.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.720]   It's not and which is just a little bit higher than what I'm experiencing when I'm just doing
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.440]   nothing but 3G.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.800]   So all in all, I would say the battery life is about the same as what you get on the iPad
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   2.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.160]   LTE does burn battery faster than 3G but not so much that you would want to not use it.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.880]   So that means that Wi-Fi iPads like riches are getting even more battery life than the
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.080]   previous year.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.880]   It's modern.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.320]   Not that you would actually feel it.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.280]   I would say that most of the power is being sucked up by the screen.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.840]   Unfortunately, I do have to say that I don't have real benchmarks going here at the office
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.040]   when I test out battery life.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.440]   It's more like I take a note of what the battery status was when I started working exclusively
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.760]   LTE, then take a note of what it was before I compared to what I was getting a couple
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   years ago.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.280]   So I do think that the LTE was burning a little bit faster.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.640]   I have also been trying it without any 3G without any 4G without any LTE.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.520]   And when I'm watching a movie, for instance, movie watching is almost exactly the same amount
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.080]   of battery life as previous.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.520]   So if you do get longer battery life working without LTE, I haven't seen that.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.520]   Interesting.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   Okay.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.240]   They did really beef up the battery.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.400]   It's not much heavier or thicker but the battery significantly.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.600]   God, I'm just holding this in front of me.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   Forget the Kevlar.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.000]   The battery is going to stop pretty much anything.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.080]   Let's talk about overheating because that's the one thing I'm getting a lot of people
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.480]   asking me on Twitter and elsewhere, well, how hot is your iPad 3?
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   Is it overheating?
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.920]   Are you having problems?
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.360]   You reported this in your review.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.520]   I've seen other reviews say 5 to 10 degrees hotter.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.760]   It's a corner where the A5 chip is.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.760]   Is that it?
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   A5X chip is, right?
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   Right.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.440]   Using it like this, you'll feel a little bit of extra heat right here.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.000]   I certainly wouldn't characterize it as overheating.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.520]   Only that I've used the iPad 1.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.120]   I used it after using it for a couple of hours.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.880]   The part of the back of this being any warmer than any other part of it.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.800]   Apart from the heat from my hands.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.200]   So this is the first iPad I've ever used where I can notice that, gosh, it feels better
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.680]   than this hand right here.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.080]   When I have it in an easel, it feels a little bit warmer.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.440]   But really, that's all it is.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.960]   It feels a little bit warmer.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.400]   Now, there are people in Apple support forums who are mentioning that, no, actually mine
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.360]   got too hot to touch.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.040]   And I don't believe that's a design problem.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.800]   I think that either A, they got a defective machine or B, they're running up.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.480]   There's a piece of buggy software that's not allowing the CPU to do proper management,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.400]   power management.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.600]   And then so it's kind of over-driving the CPU somehow.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.200]   Which, and if that's true, it would be something that either that bad piece of software could
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.320]   fix itself or Apple could say, okay, in certain circumstances, it's possible for the A5X to
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   forget that it's losing its head and please try to spin itself down.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.760]   We're going to be introducing a bug fix for that.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.920]   So I don't believe it's a design problem at all.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.000]   Yeah, I mean, a bigger, a better processor might be hotter.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.160]   But it's not so hot that you can go, wow, I haven't experienced any heat at all.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.200]   But I have this case that I have, this exhibit case, it's like the Dodo case.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   You wouldn't feel it.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   You wouldn't see it.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.480]   I watched a movie last night, but it was in the case.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:09.960]   And it's certainly not a problem that's going to cause crashing or anything.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.840]   If there's a cause, the thing to keep on driving, driving, driving, I mean, there are thermal
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.680]   tolerances throughout this.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.840]   That could be a problem.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   All I can say is that I watched three hours of HD in this and there was just, again, I
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.800]   could sort, when I took it out of the easel, if I held it like this, I could sense that
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.480]   this hand was a little bit warmer than this hand.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.960]   But it wasn't anything that I thought was of any importance whatsoever.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.840]   A number of people on, well, here's a 290 message thread on the Apple support community
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.360]   about overheating.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.640]   The thing is to me, overheating means causing a crash, not that it's warm.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.200]   There may be though, there may be some defects.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.640]   If certainly if it crashes, if you get that warning, your iPad's too hot, which you will
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.880]   get, I've had that if you leave it in the sun, I'm bringing it back.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   That's not right.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:07.080]   Let's keep in mind that this is like the very first batch of iPad 3s to run off the assembly
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.760]   line are now being put into people's hands.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:15.640]   And the manufacturer is you can always expect the first production run to reveal not necessarily
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.960]   design problems.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.680]   But here is something that we could have checked a little better, but kind of snuck out.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.000]   So now we're going to, we're going to tighten in those tolerances a little bit more.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.640]   And also now that you have not just a couple of hundred of these being tested by engineers
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.840]   and journalists, now that you have millions of these in play.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.240]   Now if there's a problem that if there is an actual bug that only affects 1% of 1% of
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.720]   1%, that's going to be a significant number of people who are going to be able to report
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   that.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.840]   Yeah, my car is on fire and I'm pretty sure it started with the iPad.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.160]   Here's a fellow in the support form saying his new iPad is 96.8 degrees.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:59.720]   That's hot to the touch, but I think well within, I mean, you know, these processors
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.200]   are going to get hot.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.440]   You got a dual core processor in there.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.520]   That's probably too hot, certainly too hot to hold.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.800]   Leave that apples, tolerance is somewhere 93, 94.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Okay.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.400]   Safe operating, internal safe operating temperature is somewhere in the low 90s, I believe.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.560]   I think Jim Dallerable over at the loop contacted Apple got a response back that simply said
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.760]   that it's well within our tolerances.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.040]   So we don't do consider if someone is reporting a temperature of X, we believe that that temperature
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.640]   happens to be within the tolerances for this design is not a problem.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.720]   And the way to test it would be to play a challenging game like Real Racing HD 2 or
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.640]   something like that that would that and play that for 10 minutes, holding that lower, what
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.840]   is it, the lower right hand corner.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.680]   And if it gets too hot to touch, you probably should bring it back.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.520]   That's probably not okay.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:58.640]   That's hot to touch and that's not what you're warm, hot, fine too hot to touch bad.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   I would say.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   The most it's a warmer.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   Say again.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.960]   Apple is as a bed warmer as in colonial times.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.320]   You just slide it between the sheets.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:14.040]   I've actually Android tablets that really did get that hot where it's like as I'm reading,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.520]   reading, reading, I'm not even like doing something really important, but if I'm reading
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.880]   and then I move to flash, that goes fine.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:25.280]   I moved to flash video and then within like halfway through an episode at CBS.com or whatever,
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   it's like, that shouldn't be.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.000]   Some are saying in, I'm just reading some of the comments in the form that it's, it's
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.360]   sometimes seems to be tied to screen brightness.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.720]   If you've got your brightness turned up all the way, you're more likely to experience
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.640]   these issues.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.040]   I have mindset on automatic.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.920]   I find that the software does a very good job of keeping the brightness accurate.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   Others say that after you use it for a while, the battery gets conditioned and you don't
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   have a problem.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.040]   That sounds like voodoo to me.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.120]   This is speaking, people speaking with what two and a half days worth of experience with
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.640]   the new wipe.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.600]   All right.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.920]   Anyway, I thought I'd bring it up because it is something people are.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.200]   This comes back up in a month, then it'll be a problem.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.280]   But if by the end of the month, we realized that this is such a small fraction of people.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.200]   They got it swapped out and a problem went away or they find out that, oh, it turns out
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.960]   there is a circumstance under which the CPU will never sleep and Apple simply fix that
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.280]   bugs and now the CPU sleeps properly in all the circumstances.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.840]   I really think that at worst, that's what's going to happen.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.280]   We found an edge case scenario in which the CPU would fail to sleep properly and so we
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.080]   fixed it.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.200]   The eye fix it tear down.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.000]   It was fun to watch it as it was happening.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.400]   They said we're doing it right now.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.880]   They got theirs in Australia, of course, day early and flew it back, tore it down immediately.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.160]   These guys are great.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.600]   I was watching almost in real time as they discovered this or that.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.400]   We mentioned the battery 42 and a half watt hours as opposed to 25 in the older model.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.880]   That's a huge increase, more than a 50% increase.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.680]   >> Is it getting exactly the same amount of battery life as you did with the last one?
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.400]   Boy, that screen is really kicking some.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.640]   >> You think it's not LTE, you think it's the screen.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.400]   I guess you're right because it's Wi-Fi has the same.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.280]   >> I don't think it's a big deal, but that's a hell of a screen.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.440]   Some have said use this as a reason why Apple will not this time around anyway, do an LTE
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.360]   iPhone.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.640]   You could put a 42.5 watt hour battery in the iPad.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.960]   There's lots of room, but you can't in the iPhone.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.600]   It sounds like what you're saying.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   It's the screen.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.400]   It's not the LTE, so nothing to worry about.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.960]   >> I'm going to back up Andy on this.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.480]   There are two extra cores in the GPU this time around.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:03.640]   Between that, having four times as many pixels to drive, you need that much extra battery,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.360]   not just in terms of battery runtime, but also in terms of how much current you're going
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.200]   to need to draw from it at once.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.680]   I don't think LTE makes that big a difference.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:22.240]   My purely uneducated guess because I am a software guy, not a hardware guy, is that
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:30.360]   an LTE iPhone would probably make provision with a slightly larger battery if power consumption
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.680]   really is that big an issue for LTE.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:40.120]   But I don't see power requirements as standing in the way of an LTE iPhone.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.960]   Another thing that ZD nets a hardware blogger Adrian Kingsley Hughes found surprising was
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:52.840]   that most of the components, including the screen, are Samsung.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   The frenemy, I guess.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.680]   I know that LG can also make these retinol displays and is possibly supplying retina parts,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:09.320]   but Samsung is still doing many of the chips inside.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   It's a big company.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.000]   Maybe they don't dislike those guys, just the phone guys.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.840]   It's like making money.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:26.200]   You can't tear down your whole supply chain because you're in a lawsuit with people.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.960]   MacRumors Forum member has discovered the Verizon iPad.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   Get this.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.600]   It can run on AT&T's 3G network if you just swap out the SIM.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:42.400]   You don't get LTO, you don't get HSPA+, but it will work fine on 3G apparently.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:49.280]   They've also had that working on micro sims from other carriers too.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.440]   They've also tried to see if that works the other way around is to put micro sims from
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.240]   other carriers into the AT&T model.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.200]   The AT&T model will not have it.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.440]   So it seems like there's nothing but upside to using the...
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   It's a horizon.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.560]   I mean, not only do they have a larger LTE network, not only are they giving you tether
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.820]  ing right now, not only are they including the price of tethering in their regular tablet
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:17.240]   data plan, but if you're traveling internationally and you just want to buy sims just going,
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.960]   it seems possible that you can get the Verizon model working on a foreign 3G network.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.200]   I haven't seen a report from that, but now I believe that would be at least worth trying.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.840]   If I were in London, if I were to have a trip to London coming up, I would be saying, well,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.640]   it might be worth spending 20 pounds to buy a sim just to see if it'll work.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.760]   Yeah, somebody wrote me an email saying, I bought a Verizon iPad, but we're traveling.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.960]   Should I have bought the AT&T?
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.920]   And I said, you know, I don't know for sure.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:47.320]   You should ask Verizon, but generally speaking, the CDMA devices won't work on a GSM network.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.680]   And even if they will, they're probably locked.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.960]   I was wrong on both counts.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:57.120]   Not only does this CDMA iPad have GSM capability, and nowadays that's fairly common because
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.760]   one chip does both.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.400]   They're probably using that Qualcomm chip, but Apple didn't lock it.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.280]   At least didn't lock this guys.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.240]   That's surprising.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.320]   I think I wouldn't be surprised if two months from now there's going to be a system update
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.520]   that everybody's saying, do not update.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.760]   You plan to travel internationally with your iPad because you'll lose a cool feature.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.840]   Well, that is great, though, that I can put a micro sim in here the next time I go overseas
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.520]   and be able to, even though it's not HSPA+, at least I'll be able to use the 3G network.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.560]   This is a 3G, although it should be pointed out that it's not as though you put it in
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.120]   a new sim and everything works magically.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.480]   You then have to manually configure your iPad to work on this new network.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.240]   But once you get all the bibs and bobs plugged in correctly, apparently it does work.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.640]   Presumably if you go, if you're in France and you go to the orange store and you say,
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.040]   "Jib is one, the Michel Saint-Poule iPad."
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.360]   After those words are English, they won't say, "Oh, and you must reconfigure the APN."
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:07.000]   I will help you do that because that is, yeah, you have to put a new APN in for whatever
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   carrier you're using.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.960]   But I would imagine that that's all part of it.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.840]   You'd have to do that with the phone, too.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.320]   We've got a great panel here, Rich Segal from...
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.040]   I'm going to ask you, Rich, about development for iOS.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.760]   Are you doing any iOS stuff?
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   A little bit.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.800]   Just a little bit, though.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   Good.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:35.440]   We'll talk more about other tablets and Apple's losing its day in court.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   Interesting.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.040]   It was all good news for Apple right up to that point.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.600]   But first, let's talk about backing things up with carbonite.com.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.280]   Works great on the Mac.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.920]   Automatic, continuous backup to the cloud.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.760]   Now you may say, "Well, I've got iCloud.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   I don't need this."
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.560]   Well, this is something a little bit different.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:03.040]   It's really dedicated backup for, you say what folders, what files, what documents.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:09.960]   And it works on all versions of Mac OS as well as Windows.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.640]   And it's unlimited storage.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   So you don't run out of storage as you would if you tried to back up your whole hard drive
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   on iCloud.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.720]   It's $59 a year for everything on your internal hard drive.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.840]   They even have plans for external hard drives and multiple computers if you want to back
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.400]   up even more.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.320]   Carbonite.com, I want you to give it a try.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.760]   It's free for the first two weeks when you use our offer code, MacBreak.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.200]   And then do do that.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.760]   I really want you to do the free trial.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.920]   Because it's dependent on your bandwidth.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.240]   It uses your upstream bandwidth.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   You want to make sure.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.120]   In fact, that first two weeks free is kind of Carbonite's way of saying, "We'll do the
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.680]   first, get that first backup done for free."
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:51.880]   And then it just continuously backs up any changes and it happens very quickly anytime
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.040]   you're online.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.040]   Completely secure, it uses SSL.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.960]   So go ahead and use it on an open access spot.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   No problem.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.400]   It's great for students for that reason.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.520]   As they move around campus, it's always backing up.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.360]   And if you want a further encrypted, you want a HIPAA compliance, for instance, you
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.600]   get to keep the key.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.960]   Carbonite will encrypt it for you using public key, strong cryptography.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.600]   And the key is yours.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.880]   Carbonite cannot see that data.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.360]   It's absolutely private.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   What more can I tell you?
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.640]   This is just a great solution.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.280]   Carbonite.com, two weeks free.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.840]   If you decide to do the two week free trial, please use Mac Break because when you decide
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:31.520]   to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12 with the offer code MacBreak.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.880]   M-A-C-B-R-E-A-K.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.200]   Carbonite.com, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.000]   On the spelling show.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.600]   Thank you, Carbonite, for your support for a Mac Break weekly.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.960]   Lenovo is going to do a Windows 8 tablet.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.040]   Do we care?
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.600]   Is Windows 8 going to be a challenge?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.040]   Well, okay, this is a good question for a developer.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:56.880]   Now, Rich, you've never done anything for Windows, period.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.840]   You never would even think about it.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.120]   Probably not.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.840]   He was thinking about it right there.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.480]   You made me think about it.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.880]   Don't look about Rhino on the other side of the room.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.880]   But I know.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.000]   Does the fact that Windows 8 really is going to be a tablet OS?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.360]   Does that change your opinion in any way?
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.040]   Not especially no.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   We've always done Mac development.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.200]   Okay, so the iOS isn't a Mac, but it doesn't matter because it's the same core.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.560]   There are a lot of the same design principles.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.440]   What are you doing on iOS?
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:42.920]   Well, we have YoGimbo for the iPad, which is a companion for YoGimbo on the desktop.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.840]   We've been maintaining that.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.440]   Of course, the iCloud transition is coming up.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:58.200]   We're looking at taking advantage of that before MobileMe goes away into the sunset.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.280]   That's keeping us pretty busy.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.880]   Once you have iCloud, then you just use that instead.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.480]   Yeah, today we have point to point synchronization between a single iPad and a single desktop
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   client.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:18.400]   Once iCloud's on board, the synchronization story goes back to what it was with MobileMe.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.320]   So you're working on that?
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   Yep.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.240]   And Feld in our chat room says, "Can we have Text Wrangler, too?"
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   It depends on what you wanted to do.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.840]   There are a lot of considerations in doing a product like BB Editor Text Wrangler on
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.200]   the iPad.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   It's not really a text editing monster, is it?
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:48.320]   Well, not really, because the way you interact with an iPad for editing is real different.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.800]   Usually you're editing in smaller bits.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:58.920]   Yes, okay, you could hook up an external keyboard and write an entire column on it as somebody
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:05.120]   I know I think did recently.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.320]   But for coding, there's not a clear story there.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:15.200]   So we're not going to rule that one out because the iOS and the hardware are clearly moving
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:22.040]   in a direction that makes it a little bit more accommodating of uses like that.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.640]   But there's still a lot to work out.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.080]   I was kind of surprised.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.680]   I've been using the dictation in the iPad.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.120]   And it's so good that I actually find it easier to do email in the iPad that on my desktop,
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.440]   all of a sudden I'm doing my email.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.800]   I'm powering through it.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   And it works here.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   I'll show you.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   It works really great.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.640]   So here, Craig Fine just sent me, I won't show you his information, but sent me this
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.840]   great graphic.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   Really pretty.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.560]   So I want to send him a thank you note.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.920]   So I'm just going to do a reply, press the dictation button.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.160]   Hey, Craig, that's gorgeous.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.440]   Thank you so much, exclamation mark.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.920]   Thanks for listening and writing, period.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.240]   And it does, it does such a, it's perfect.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.680]   I've had to do a little correction every once in a while, but talk about an easy way to
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   respond to email.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.160]   I've been powering through my email with dictation.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.880]   And once you get used to the kind of the cadence and rhythm that works best, you can
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.000]   be pretty close to 100% all the way.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.040]   That's punctuation.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.120]   You could say new paragraph.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.320]   You can say exclamation mark.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.720]   I even said ellipsis the other day and it worked.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.320]   You say, say again, say smiley and a linser to smiley.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   No.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.000]   Let me try that.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.960]   Hey, Craig ellipsis, I forgot to insert a smiley.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.280]   Insert smiley.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.080]   Did I do that right?
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.360]   Oh, it did.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.080]   So I don't need the insert.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.040]   Just say smiley.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.040]   How funny, it was smart enough to know the difference.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.880]   It actually typed smiley and then put a smiley.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.120]   It knew the difference.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:11.240]   I forgot to insert a smiley, smiley and it put a smiley.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.200]   Does it do frowny?
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.080]   I think it uses, I think it does.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.640]   I'm not someone who uses frownies in my email.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   So.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   Wow.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.880]   Now, see, that's pretty impressive now.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:31.560]   Go ahead and write a web page using HTML, PHP, CSS and a little JavaScript.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.720]   Bracket and bracket, close bracket slash.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.720]   I suppose you could.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   I'm going to call them left bracket, angle bracket left.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.320]   You know, there are going to be people.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:48.560]   I predict that there are children growing up today who will write code that way.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.880]   Semi-colon, new paragraph.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.560]   Although what really should happen is as long as the machine is translating speech into
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.680]   text, it might as well translate commands into code.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.000]   You know, wait for a few minutes.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.320]   And then launch a process.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.160]   Let's call it draw screen.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.680]   Put that in the window that's on top there.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.080]   No, not that one, the other one.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.880]   And just have it do that.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.800]   Yeah, you should be able to develop software by saying, you know, Instagram, I'm not only
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.040]   not actionable by the Instagram.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   Give me an Instagram.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.440]   I can't be sued for, will you?
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   Working.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.840]   Working.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   What a world.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:38.240]   And you can just sort of describe in broad terms what you want to do and the machine
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.440]   will generate code to do it.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.840]   Do you think that'll happen someday?
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:49.400]   I think at a high level with certain sorts of user facing automation, I could see Automator
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.160]   itself, the very trick technology that's part of the OS.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:58:01.200]   I can see that evolving to hook up to dictation because there's a fairly well sorted out set
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.880]   of things you can do.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.680]   I think writing code is always something you're going to do with hands on a keyboard though.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.280]   You guys still need a truck.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.920]   That's right.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.920]   Sorry.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.440]   They need a truck.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.320]   Do you worry, Rich, about the future of Mac and Tasha's?
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.960]   Apple seems to kind of, you know, they're so enamored of the iOS side, they seem to be
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.200]   kind of stepping back from Macs.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.800]   I don't think so.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:39.640]   You're still going to need Macs to develop the iDevices.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   You still need the sort of processing power, you still need the sort of storage, both dynamic
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:52.800]   and static storage that desktop devices can provide.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:59:01.280]   There are always going to be applications that are the next generation of throughput requirements
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.800]   that are going to exceed what's available on a mobile device.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.600]   I include iPads as mobile devices.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.800]   So I don't really worry about the future of desktop computing.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.280]   Are they going to change radically?
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.680]   Do I know what they're going to look like in five years now?
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.360]   No idea what they're going to look like in five years.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.720]   They're going to say nothing of 10 or 15 or 20.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:30.400]   I think there's always going to be a place in the ecosystem for something that is an order
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:38.080]   of magnitude or two more powerful than that thing you carry around in your hands.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.120]   So as such, no, I don't really worry about it.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:49.520]   As long as Apple is using Macs to produce the iOS and mobile devices, I think there's going
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.240]   to be a place for them.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.320]   Either that or we're going to go back to the days when you bought a Lisa and use the right
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   Mac software.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   Oh my God.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.200]   You weren't around then.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.400]   That was, well, there's a funny story there that the days in which that was routinely done
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.760]   were just before, just a couple of years before the time I started writing Mac software.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.520]   In fact, my very first job was working for one of the very first producers of native
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.320]   Mac developer tools.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   Who was that?
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.120]   However, that was a company called Think Technologies.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120]   Think.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   Loved.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.520]   Oh, that's C compiler.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.120]   Think C was amazing.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120]   Light C-T and Think C really changed.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   Light's being.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.800]   Yeah, that was the first name of it.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.920]   They really changed the game.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:45.560]   But I did for a while work on a project that was still an old school Mac project that predated
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.560]   all of that stuff.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.360]   And I had to use a Lisa to build and debug a Mac product.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.880]   And let me tell you, I don't want to go back there.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   No.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.520]   Cross-platform development is always horrible.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.240]   Although I have to say that having done iOS work, the basic notions are the same thing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.880]   And the experience is much more refined than it used to be.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.160]   So there's nothing wrong with cross development as such.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.920]   It's just, I don't know that I'd want to do Mac software that way.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   Wow, yeah.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   Think.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.360]   You started to think.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.640]   I think I knew that about you.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.160]   I was there in 1987.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.600]   Was that MIT that, were those MIT graduates that were doing that?
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:39.280]   No, the guys who started there were actually Harvard grads, Harvard Math.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   Okay.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.880]   The principal architect of Light Sweet Sea was, I think he'd gotten his undergraduate
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.360]   degree in philosophy and then went back and got his masters in math.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.120]   Which is perfect when you think about what it takes to work on a compiler.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   A very bright guy.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.600]   I think he's actually working at Apple now.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.000]   I was using, of course, MPW first.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.640]   And then I think I used Code Warrior.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.920]   And then I really loved, but I would light speed and then think, see, it was just, it
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.080]   was so fast.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.920]   I had used Turbo Pascal from Portland on Windows.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.000]   So I really liked this idea of right compile iterate.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.200]   These cycles are so quick.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.960]   It was just, it was a revelation for people who had had, you know, you go have a cup of
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.680]   coffee with a thing, compiles.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   No more coffee.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.240]   Remember those days?
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.920]   Oh, no, I have coffee.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   Yes.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   While it compiles.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   That's my pick of the week is coffee.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   All right.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.680]   I got a question for Bozy is, I really would like to buy a second screen, a second cinema
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.600]   display for my Mac Pro.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.800]   One 27 inch screen is not enough.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Should I wait?
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.640]   Will there be a retina cinema display?
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.120]   Is Apple going to go all retina?
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.040]   If they keep these Mac things, these trucks alive, will they go all retina or will they
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.680]   not even bother?
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   I think that they're a computer to say desktop display is probably already retina because
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   you don't use it.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.000]   You don't hold it so close to your face.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.520]   You need that ultra high resiliency.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520]   Good.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.520]   So I'll buy that right now then.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.640]   I was just waiting for your go ahead, Andy.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:21.480]   Well, you can't see it, of course, but I have a going on seven years old 30 inch cinema
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   display.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.960]   My only complaint about it is that it draws a lot of juice and it actually puts out a surprising
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.760]   amount of heat.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.720]   I bought that display, that same display.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.280]   I think one of our editors now uses it because I like one display that's extra big, but I
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.720]   don't think Apple sells that anymore.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.840]   I don't see it on there.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.960]   I would love to get a 30 inch display.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.800]   No, they don't, but you know, you could look around, get one used maybe.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.640]   Yeah, maybe I could buy it from you.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.640]   Maybe.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.680]   Here's a refurbished 30 inch 1299 out of stock.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.240]   Apple says out of stock originally released in 2004.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.000]   Okay, so there's actually there's a feed that I'm using.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.880]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.600]   It scrapes the Apple store.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.760]   So you plug into it what you want.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:26.080]   It's refurb dash tracker.com and you plug into it what you're looking for and you it shows
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.160]   up in your RSS feed when there's something ready.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   How cool.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.920]   How cool.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:39.440]   So here's a refurbbed quad core I7 iMac 27 inch 1569.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.200]   That is a good deal.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.400]   This is how we'll be buying all our Macs going forward.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.720]   I'm sorry I shouldn't say that.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.880]   This school my kids go to my actually my kid my daughter went to my son currently goes
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.880]   to used to give Mac books to incoming freshmen.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.160]   It was a one to one computer program, which is a great idea.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.200]   Apple has discontinued that white Mac book.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.080]   We're up in the air about what do we do and I hate to this kills me.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.160]   They're looking at a Lenovo Windows machine because Apple has nothing in that price point
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.280]   that's robust enough to give a high school kid.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.360]   I think I think the Apple's answered that as well get them an iPad.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.480]   If you know, put them in it right in a girl case.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:30.120]   I'm not saying it's the right answer, but that's the I am I am sad that they've gotten
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.360]   rid of that that different machine.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.400]   They're going to lose schools.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.160]   It's a as as the parent of no child in the house.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.720]   All this.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.040]   I suggested an air and they said it's too expensive and we're worried because it doesn't have
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   a drive.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.720]   So we're going to have to buy an external drive, you know, optical drive because all
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.520]   the textbooks still come with CD rhymes in them.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.560]   The French book does the physics book does and the kids need to mount those CD rhymes.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:05.720]   It's not that you use a DVD or a CD every single week, but if you only need one twice
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.480]   a year that twice a year boy are you going to be annoyed that you don't have computers
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.800]   in the house that have a CD drive.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.960]   I bought a I bought a digital microscope a couple of weeks ago that came packaged with
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.280]   the CD.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.520]   And it became such a it.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.800]   Yes, I could have used CD sharing, but unfortunately it was a Windows problem.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.600]   I don't actually have a working Windows machine that actually has a CD drive by what my main
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:37.000]   Windows notebook is is a is a an a source machine that has no DVD drive built in.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.640]   So the only times I needed are the times where it's frustrating as hell that I can't use
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640]   it.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.840]   So that's the sort of problem that people like the educators are bumping their heads against.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840]   Yep.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.040]   This just the end.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040]   Go ahead.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:54.640]   Sorry, just as a countervailing viewpoint, my my steps on is going to an independent school
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.400]   and there they're actually I think K through 12 or one through 12.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:06.160]   And the middle school there is has just started a one to one iPad program where every student
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.160]   gets an iPad.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.960]   So they're getting away from from hard media.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.360]   Just wanted to just want to text book initiative that makes a lot of sense.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.160]   They put all the textbooks on there.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   I worry about how are the kids going to write papers?
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.800]   Oh, hard to tell.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.760]   In in in high school, they have laptops and so they do still have lapsed up.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.600]   So this is only for the middle school.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   Correct.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.920]   And and there is a little bit less writing.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.560]   There's a little bit less writing in the middle school, but I mean, that's a legitimate
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.960]   concern.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.240]   Of course, in, you know, you can connect a keyboard up to an iPad.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.360]   So that's something to think about as well.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.760]   That's kind of cluegy by the time.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.360]   I know I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm naturally I'm the tech advisor and I'm going on.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.680]   I don't know what to do.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.840]   How would you how do you feel about virtualization?
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   Because what how would you feel about all the kids get iPads and when they need to run
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.680]   like Windows style apps, they simply connect to a school server that's running Windows
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.320]   and virtualization mode.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.280]   So we can just simply act as a client.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.360]   So it works great as a tablet works great as an e reader device.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.440]   It looks great for for electronic textbooks.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:21.680]   But when you do need that piece of whatever Windows lab Windows lab system, they can just
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.720]   simply work with a machine that they can't touch.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.920]   They can't control and they can't screw up possibly.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.720]   The other reason that I worry for a student about an iPad experience and I worry a little
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.760]   bit about where OS 10 is going, by the way, this is if you go to apple.com/education Apple
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.360]   clearly wants you to buy iPads.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.520]   And I mean, that's probably why they discontinued the white MacBook, to be honest.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.240]   They want you to buy white iPads instead.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.520]   I worry a little bit about the lack of Windows because I don't know.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.920]   Maybe this is old school, but I like to have say, I'm writing a paper.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.760]   I would like to have a browser window open to the right or a textbook.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.160]   You know, I'd like to have multiple windows and you can't do that either.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.360]   Absolutely, absolutely correct.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.840]   When I was writing my review, it was about a three or four thousand word project.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:18.720]   And I just got to, so I had like my personal iPad and the, my, the Elone iPad three.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.920]   And I just got used to the fact that this is a really good setup.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.600]   Having two separate machines with two separate, two separate windows, I can have a dual screen
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.280]   thing that's still lighter than my MacBook, which I was, I had one open that was just
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.720]   respects and research.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.400]   The other one that I had just my word processing window on.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.320]   But to ask, ask somebody to say, well, if you want to have a second window open on your
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.480]   iPad, it'll cost you $399 for a second iPad, but it works great.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.400]   It's, I think that that's one of the reasons why I'm really curious to see how consumers
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.600]   react to Metro on Windows eight, because Metro has solutions to that kind of problem that
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.840]   right now iOS does not.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   Right.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.920]   I'm curious if that's so important to so many people that that people are going to consider
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.600]   that a real tactical advantage.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.760]   This just in from Apple insider consumer reports, which is doing its review of the new iPad
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.480]   and just published it.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.120]   They're going to do a first look later this week.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.120]   They quickly published on Tuesday afternoon information that its engineers recorded temperatures
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.440]   as high as 116 degrees while playing infinity blade two.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:32.360]   That was an iPad standing up with Apple smart cover, the 4G LTE connection off and the tablet
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:39.520]   was plugged in the game ran for 45 minutes and they got to 113 degrees unplugged 116
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.560]   degrees plugged in.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.720]   That's 13 and 12 degrees hotter respectively than the same tests with an iPad two.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.120]   So it does get hotter.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.920]   I don't know if that is outside of Apple's tolerance, but it does get hotter.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:01.200]   They have a interesting heat map here on the left, the new iPad on the right, the iPad
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   two.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.280]   I confess I didn't, I didn't try three.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.520]   I didn't try gaming.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.560]   I played games but not like for hours on end.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:15.160]   Well that's where you're going to get the most CPU and GPU activity right is playing
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.840]   something with a 3D rendering.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840]   Absolutely.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840]   Wow.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   All right.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.440]   Well, I don't, I see, and I don't know if 116 degrees is unacceptable or not.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.560]   That's pretty hot.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.640]   Is that too hot to the touch?
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   I can't, I don't know.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.720]   Depends on what your hands are made of I suppose.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.360]   I worked as a fry cook at McDonald's when I was a teenager.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.560]   I have no feeling in the tips of my fingers.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.880]   This is in the old days now McDonald's.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.920]   I think they have a machine that flips the burgers or they grill both sides at once.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.600]   But in the old days you would take three patties with a, they had a long spatula and
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.160]   you have three regular patties and three fingers and you'd flip them.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.000]   They taught me to do it that way.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.680]   And the first few times it was like, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.000]   And by the end of my shift, I didn't feel a thing.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.920]   And I never will again.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.360]   Nowadays kids today, they grill both sides at once.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.960]   It's easy.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:19.600]   Mike Daisy, the name that will live in infamy.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.400]   Mike is the monologist, the solo performer who I know fairly well.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.880]   We used to have them on the screensavers all the time.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.440]   Really like the guy who did the agony and the ecstasy of Steve Jobs in which he talked
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.600]   about apparently fabricated tales of meeting workers who had been poisoned at the iPhone
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:45.400]   factory of a child, many, many child workers also fabricated this American life.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.240]   As we mentioned a few weeks ago, did a special show on conditions at Foxconn interviewed.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.040]   Actually, they played the part of the monologue and at no time did Mike Daisy say, I made
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.560]   this stuff up.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.640]   Well, on Friday, this American life did an entire episode dedicated to a retraction because
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.080]   apparently Daisy did make this stuff up.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.040]   Some have said, well, why didn't Apple say anything?
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.000]   And apparently at least one reporter for, I think it was Slate Magazine said, Apple did
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.360]   say unofficially, anonymously said, you know, you really ought to look into this stuff before
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.880]   you republish it.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.400]   Apparently, they said the same thing to this American life, which ignored them.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.840]   Before I tell you a surprising reaction to this, let me ask each of you what you think
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   about this.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.120]   Mike Daisy apologized but said, hey, I'm not a journalist, it's theater.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:43.360]   My only mistake was allowing it to be used on this American life as if it were journalism.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.160]   Does that stand?
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.160]   No, that's just BS.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.480]   What really frustrates me about, and he isn't the first and the only person to do things
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:14:01.000]   like this is to say that I was to give a presentation and say and want to have the legitimacy and
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.960]   the respect of someone who's done and done their research has their facts down cold.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.600]   They want to get that kind of honor and that kind of respect.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.360]   But then when people point out that, wow, you really cut corners here.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.320]   You did things that no journalist would ever allow to happen.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.560]   They said, oh, well, hey, I'm just an entertainer.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560]   Hey, I'm in this.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.120]   The rules of theater, I'm creating a new reality.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.280]   It's like, and it's like, no, I'm sorry, but if you're going to go on a new show after
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.040]   you do your little stage piece and say that, well, here are the conditions that I saw and
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.840]   here's what you're not on a stage at that point.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.720]   And while you're on the stage, you're not playing the part of this guy.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.640]   You're actually using your own name, recounting your own experiences and saying phrases like
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   this really happen.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.160]   I actually saw that.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.440]   What are people going to?
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.720]   Maybe everybody are going to send a briefing paper to every single person in that theater
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.040]   saying, now let me explain what the rules of the theater are.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.840]   I'm going to tell you, before you believe any particular detail that I'm going to tell
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.280]   you, realize that I might make things up just to sort of get to the larger truth underneath
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   it.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.160]   That's just BS.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   And he's compounding his error, I think, by going on.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.000]   But his response is not, yeah, I just thought it would be more easy to understand if I fudged
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.360]   a few facts.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.040]   Most of the things I was talking about really happened, they may not have happened right
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.960]   there that moment, but they really happen.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.200]   No, he's saying, you know, it's really sad.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:25.960]   Isn't it how unfortunate that some belly acres are harping on trivial details when really
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.640]   the issue is worker safety?
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.800]   No, you're hiding behind the issue of worker safety because you don't want to simply look
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.560]   at people in the eye and saying, yep, I made this stuff up.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.320]   I manipulated you and I perpetuated a falsehood about what my experience is because I wanted
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.480]   to manipulate you into thinking exactly what I wanted to think.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.440]   And there is a point that there is still a lot of problems with manufacturing, a lot
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.680]   of problems with labor that need to be addressed.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.200]   It should be said that organizations like The New York Times published long pieces that
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.560]   were sort of inspired by this monologue, but they were mostly, they weren't just simply
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.280]   cutting and pasting his monologue verbatim.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.680]   They're actually reporting on, well, these incidents really, really happened.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.520]   This incident with the powder explosion really, really happened.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.120]   This incident with the hexane really, really happened.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.680]   But instead of conflating, instead of trying to make it into more than what it was or trying
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:22.920]   to make the, he held out a narrow claw that was once a human head.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.840]   For the eye.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.000]   So you're, I don't know, it's insulting.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.760]   He's basically saying that the fact that there are workers who are injured in industrial
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.720]   accidents, that's not compelling enough.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.560]   You have to make a lie around it in order to make people listen to it.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.200]   That's just BS.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.440]   So he's just, that's just terrible.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.080]   No excuse.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080]   You agree, Rich?
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080]   I do.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:52.440]   I was looking for something that Andy said that I could latch on to and amplify on, but
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   there isn't.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   It's a good statement.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.840]   You just said almost exactly what I would say.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:05.400]   I mean, even the argument that you can distort the facts and service of the truth or in service
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.640]   of the greater cause, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.200]   And I think the, the, the, the, one of the tragic things here is that apart from just
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:23.520]   having completely depth bombed his own career, he's also caused a loss of credibility in
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.320]   the issue that he was trying to highlight to begin with there.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.880]   I mean, there is a real issue there.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:34.280]   I don't argue that at all, but I, I fear that too many people are going to say, oh,
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.120]   well, he made this stuff all up, whether or not there's an issue.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:42.120]   There isn't really important and maybe there isn't an issue there after all.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.720]   And that would be a shame.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.160]   And that would be a shame that will happen.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.760]   Maybe not enough to completely dilute the issue to begin with, but, but yeah, it's going
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.840]   to happen.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.120]   And that is to me very unfortunate.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:02.320]   But yeah, other than that, I really have, I don't have any argument with, with what
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320]   Andy just laid out.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.760]   You know, seen at Greg Sandoval, seen at interviewed, uh, fall people, Steve Knott was
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:16.320]   thinking about that was saw the show, the agony acts to see if Steve Jobs in February.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.000]   And actually, I think it was February of last year.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.640]   And he says that he defends him.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.240]   He says, I think his monologue, this is a direct quote, has influenced Apple to take
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.080]   steps in that direction as best they can.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.440]   I don't want to see that undone because people must know there are workers who can't get
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.000]   medical coverage and are underage and are put on a blacklist that prevents them from
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   getting work again.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.960]   I applaud Mike Daisy because of the attention and understanding he has brought to this.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.800]   His show gets people feeling good and they tell themselves, I want to be a good person.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.160]   Is there any way that I can help?
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.520]   I think Mike Daisy got Apple and other companies more attuned to the issue to do the most they
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.280]   can to make corrections.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.760]   It is true that after, you know, I don't know if it's Mike Daisy or the, uh, the New York
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.960]   Times reports, but Apple certainly has opened up the doors and has asked for an audit and
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.320]   there is more attention on this.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.280]   I think there is a risk that people could then brush it off saying, well, Mike made
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.280]   it up.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.280]   So I think it's okay now.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.600]   So let's emphasize that the end, it's an ongoing problem and, uh, and something should
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.440]   be done about it.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.720]   But I don't think I, you know, Steve is a nice guy.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.880]   Steve's never going to say anything bad about anybody.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.480]   Like, and, uh, I think that he probably was reluctant to say anything bad about Mike
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.480]   Daisy.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:39.040]   Um, I think, I think Andy you said it all.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:45.480]   It is, it is, you know, look, anybody who's doing storytelling on stage is making stuff
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.480]   up story, the art of storytelling is making stuff up.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.640]   But, um, it's an issue.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.760]   It's interesting because, uh, Foxconn is not going to, I saw this story that Foxconn is
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:05.640]   not going to sue, uh, as a result of this, I didn't know that they were even considering
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   it.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.840]   Like the best thing at this point is to say, look, we're going to do everything we can
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.040]   to make workers conditions better.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   Period.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.400]   I regret more effectively anything that Foxconn's lawyers or they in court system, whatever
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   do.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400]   Yeah, their attraction solved the problem.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.400]   Take down.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.920]   It actually glass went, uh, it was a very personal, uh, so when she was talking not only about,
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.280]   well, here's what, here's what turned out to be true, what turned out to be true.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.800]   But he also talked about, uh, talking to him later on, and his audio of, of conversation
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.240]   about, well, why did you tell us this?
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.600]   Because it turns out that he also was lying to the producers of this American life about
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.360]   and doing things to prevent them from properly vetting some of the stories he's telling in
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   the monologue.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.120]   And it's like, and of course, and, uh, it was just, it was, it was a complete takedown.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.880]   It was, it got open.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   It was open.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:03.800]   Um, moving along a new feature on the, uh, Apple store, uh, questions from the community
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.560]   and answers from the community.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.600]   I think this is really interesting.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.120]   Uh, of course, Apple's had and was one of the early companies to put their on their
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:17.200]   support forms a lot of information, uh, online that you could get information to.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.320]   Now at the bottom of this is at the iPhone four S page at the bottom of all the product
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:27.760]   pages, you will find questions and answers from the community, which is, I think, kind
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   of, kind of cool.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.320]   Uh, I presume that Apple's vetting the answers so that, yeah, it has a best answer.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.840]   Um, this is something I'm, I'm going to do on the tech guy page.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   Apple, you stole my idea.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.280]   I was just to say it's like stack overflow, but for, uh, exactly.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   It's stack overflow.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.720]   But for Apple related stuff.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.000]   Uh, we want to do this in the tech guy page.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.400]   So I'll have the answer on the, from the radio show and then have, uh, listeners correct
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.240]   me or add, uh, and then have votes just like stack overflow does and Apple does that raise
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.800]   the better questions or better answers, I should say to the top.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.040]   So this is good.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.400]   I like this.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.400]   Use community.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.200]   Why not?
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:13.960]   Um, here's an interesting question from Cnet about, uh, Windows eight and Metro.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.920]   What is Apple going to do about iTunes?
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.280]   Will Apple make a Metro version of iTunes?
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.000]   It would be a great way to torpedo Microsoft's tablet effort if they don't.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.560]   I don't think it would torpedo it.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:36.840]   I mean, the Microsoft has their, it has their own big gun, which is Microsoft office.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:41.040]   And if they simply decided that, I was thinking about this over the weekend as I was figuring
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.840]   out different ways I could use the new iPad for virtualization and with VNC and ways
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:51.600]   to project desktop apps into the iPad screen that Microsoft could do something hugely disruptive.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.480]   If they simply decided to sell Microsoft office also as a virtual service so that all you need
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.360]   to do is download a very simple client app on your iPad on your, uh, on your Metro tablet,
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.800]   uh, on your Android tablet, uh, pay five bucks a month and you will get access to cloud
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.480]   storage and full versions of the desktop editions of Microsoft office running on Windows.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.720]   That would really upset the balance of power.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.680]   A lot of people who would be saying that I don't necessarily need an iPad.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:22.920]   I just want to run these three important apps and the Kindle reader and a whole month and
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.760]   Skype and a couple other apps that are universal at this point that would sway a lot of people
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.360]   away from the iPad towards the right kind of Metro tablet or the right kind of Android
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.360]   tablet.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.360]   So I did read the article.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:38.160]   It's interesting what Apple could do if they decided not to support, uh, not to build a
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.800]   Metro iTunes app, but all they would have to, what would be more effective is to find a
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.680]   way to prevent people from making their iTunes libraries work with this, with, with this
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.680]   tablet.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:52.080]   As a matter of fact, it might even be in Apple's best interest to control the experience by
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.600]   building their own Metro app for iTunes.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:24:01.000]   Otherwise with 500 million licenses for Windows seven alone in the past year, somebody's
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.120]   going, some clever developer is going to write a utility that integrates iTunes into Metro
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.160]   in ways that are probably as good as what a native iTunes app would do.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.800]   And remember that we've seen in their history that if you leave an independent developer
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:19.520]   with the freedom to try to put as many features as possible into an unapproved app that interacts
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.960]   with the iPod or iTunes, they're going to find features that aren't available in the
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.320]   legitimate version of my dude.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.000]   So it might actually be, I could, I could understand the argument that it's apples in
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.080]   Apple's best interest to make sure they control the experience on Metro as they can control
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.920]   it on Windows as well.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.240]   iTunes sure could use some challenges, I think we'd love to see.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.000]   Actually there are many other choices on Windows like Monkey, what is it, Monkey Media?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.160]   There's some really good choices that are Songbird, I love double twist.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.960]   So there are some choices out there that are iTunes compatible already.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.640]   Yeah, let me cough up an alternative viewpoint for you on this though.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.880]   Something that is very clearly, I was going to say on the horizon, but actually it's here.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:10.800]   And that is Apple is pushing extremely hard on getting iTunes, getting iOS devices separated
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.400]   from desktop hosts.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.280]   Yes, as they should be because a lot of people want iPads but don't have computers.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:26.680]   Well indeed and with iOS 5 and iCloud you really can get along quite nicely without
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.240]   a desktop computer at all.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.200]   There's over the air updating, there's over the air content downloading of your iTunes
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.480]   store purchases, you can stream stuff to or from anything you like.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:45.240]   So I think there's an argument to be made that Apple doesn't need iTunes on Windows
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.760]   anymore.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.160]   And maybe that's a little bit ahead of the game, maybe that's a little bit ahead of its time.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.280]   But that's another way to look at it is maybe Apple doesn't care if there isn't iTunes
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:05.840]   on Metro because it is no longer a necessary component of supporting iOS for Windows users.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.320]   The other thing is I don't think that any operating system now really needs the iTunes
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.000]   store in and of itself.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.400]   Now that we have a really good competitor in the Amazon MP3 store.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.920]   Amazon has a lot of time to deliver to a Metro tablet or Android tablet.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:26.200]   Not only pretty much every feature that iCloud and iTunes matches but also Amazon Instant
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.640]   Video so that we'll get the video and movies.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.320]   They just keep adding and Amazon keeps adding and adding and adding streamable licenses
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.760]   to their streamable library.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.320]   So there are a lot of variables here.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:44.440]   The question is that the implication of the article which I disagree with is that Apple
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:50.360]   has the ability to kill a new platform by not directly supporting iTunes on it.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.880]   And I don't really think that's true.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:56.840]   There are already Android phones.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.440]   Android phones have managed to do okay without a native iTunes client on it.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:05.200]   So I really think that if Apple tried to exert influence over Metro by not supporting it,
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.160]   they would find that that wouldn't be correct.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.520]   I think Rich is right though.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.560]   I think that Apple just, it's not so much that they were going to, "Huh, we're going
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.560]   to kill Metro by not supporting iTunes."
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.720]   Then what are you going to do?
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.560]   I think Metro might not necessarily even be on their radar where we can get along fine
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.800]   with it without it why create more problems for ourselves.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:32.120]   Let's wrap up in, oh I did mention we would talk about the ITC ruling.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:40.040]   You may remember that Apple tried to keep Modo Morola from selling phones in the US.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.840]   They went to the International Trade Commission saying it infringes three Apple patents.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:51.920]   ITC just said, "Nope, after looking at it, no violation."
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.120]   So the investigation is terminated.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.640]   Apple could appeal to Federal Circuit Court, although they are appealing some other negative
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.680]   rulings from the ITC.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:12.480]   But it's apparently uncommon for an ITC review notice like this to be overturned.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.160]   So that's probably that on the Modo Morola complaint.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.760]   We're going to take a break, come back with your tips, your picks, but first a word from
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   audible.com.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.960]   The world's largest audiobook store, over 100,000 titles, bestsellers, non-fiction and
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:35.360]   fiction sci-fi, young adults, mysteries, thrillers, romance, business.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.400]   It just goes on and on.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.600]   You pretty much have the run of the store because I'm going to set it up for you that
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.960]   you can get a credit towards your first book, absolutely free.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.200]   Most books are a single credit.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.080]   So in most cases, this is a free book.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.920]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak, sign up for that gold account.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.600]   The first book is free.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.920]   You can cancel at any time, pay absolutely nothing.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.080]   However, I think you will want to stick around because audible is so great.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.920]   If you listen to podcasts, you're just a natural audible listener.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.920]   It's just the way to solve my commute.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.600]   It makes it more fun to be at the gym, makes it even more fun to do housework.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.880]   I listen to audible all the time.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.560]   I'm wondering what Andy always has a good pick.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:26.280]   In fact, most of the audible books I've listened to in my library, over 500 books since I joined
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.720]   audible, 10, 11, 12 years ago have been recommendations from Andy.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.960]   I've got the stand that's next on my queue.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.840]   They just released that six part.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.600]   It's like 50 hours Stephen King novel.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.400]   What do you listen to, Andy?
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.120]   What do you like these days?
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.560]   I went back to something I bought a few years ago.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.280]   Phil played his Bad Astronomy book that he published about 10 years ago.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280]   Phil's a friend.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.520]   I'm also a fan of his Bad Astronomy blog.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:00.600]   He writes about science and the sky is in a way that's really immediate and relevant
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.960]   and approachable to just about everybody.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.040]   As usual, did the service to the Mac community, the Apple community by evaluating the claim
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.280]   of Apple about the iPad's retina display.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.280]   He's an astronomer.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   Part of his job is to look, squint into eyepieces and have his eyes look at tiny, tiny little
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240]   detail.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.760]   The science of human vision is not at all unknown to an astronomer.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.400]   He was able to back up the claim that if Apple was saying that at a certain distance, a display
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.240]   of this resolution is tighter than the human eye can resolve, I'm willing to say here's
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.280]   the map that says that, yes, they are correct.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.120]   You cannot actually resolve detail beyond this here.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.640]   Bad Astronomy book is really, really cool because two reasons.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.000]   Just a whole bunch of different chapters about certain things that people don't really understand
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.360]   about how astronomy works.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:56.680]   He started out the blog as a way of explaining how in every single movie, a meteorite hits
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.240]   the earth and is smoking hot.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.880]   He has explained that not hot when they hit the earth and here's the reason why they don't
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.880]   do that.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.800]   This is a collection of lots of those cool essays about explaining how things work with
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.440]   astronomy and how it interacts with the real world.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:17.480]   But it's particularly good for audio because I have bought science books as audiobooks.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.800]   The problem is I'm trying to drive and focus on not killing myself and others.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:27.240]   Meanwhile, I'm hearing someone say, yes, but the NR Blackband radiation of more than 20
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.840]   nanometers has an influence.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:34.120]   Wait a minute, back again, has an influence, framely confusion when it interacts with,
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   wait, what was that again?
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:39.520]   9.2 nanometers and now I'm in an oncoming traffic.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.360]   If you were to say, there are some people who are saying, oh, this is the bad astronomy
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.760]   book is a little bit too basic.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.480]   A, I don't think it's too basic.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:50.200]   But also it means that on audio, he's telling the narrator is really talking and explaining
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.240]   how things work and it's very, very easy to understand and follow it as you're listening
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.400]   to the audiobook.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:01.840]   So it is 10 years old, but facts about why there are no stars in the Apollo moon landing
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.280]   pictures.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.440]   There's no new research on that in the past 10 years, so it's all still perfectly good.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:12.360]   But you'll favor to mind, really like a lot and anything the Phil writes is worth listening
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360]   to or reading.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.520]   I agree, Phil is just fantastic.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.720]   The bad astronomers, bad astronomy book, a great pick, but that's just one of many, many
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.200]   books you could choose from.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.920]   Pick up a book today on us, your first book's free at audible.com/mac.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:32.920]   By the way, they've got a great iPhone app, iPad app, actually it's iPhone only.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.280]   I mean, it works on the iPad, but it's not iPad-elicious and Android app.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.440]   I just really love because my whole library is on there.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.600]   I can listen to any book in my library.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.600]   Phil.com/macbreak.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.680]   All right.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.680]   Let's get it.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.320]   Do you want to do a Mac OS tip Andy while we're talking tips, and then we can get our
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.640]   picks of the week?
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.520]   I can give you a quick one.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.640]   Most of my favorite Mac tips come from the preview app.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.240]   I can't imagine, I can't believe the number of features that they just put into this thing.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.000]   And you saw me using one of them last night, if you have a folder or a bunch of images
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.920]   or a bunch of anything that you need to show just to present really quickly, you can just
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.560]   select them all in the Finder.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:18.960]   If their images can command to open them, they will not only will open because preview
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:25.840]   is the default image viewer for GIF and JPEG and PNG, but also it will collect them together
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.520]   and use them as a unit.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.480]   So then if you go into full screen mode, you can simply page through them as a slideshow
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:34.520]   left, left, right, right, up, up, down, down.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.360]   If you can, it will, the image will slide to that direction.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.000]   If you tap the down arrow, the next one will slide off to that direction.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.160]   It's the quickest way if you want to present a sequence of images and it's not worth doing
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.120]   a keynote presentation, it's not worth making a big deal out of it.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.680]   You just need to present them.
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.480]   That's always my go-to solution.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.640]   So someday, I really think I could write a 300-page book just about the preview app.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.760]   And after I'm done with that, I would get feedback, "Oh, you forgot the Maglev implementation
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.640]   feature, which will predict what train will be coming at your station."
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.320]   And you give them a moment, "Wow, why don't you do that?"
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:14.040]   Well, just option shift click on the Apple menu while the preview, while the map is active,
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.240]   it will show you what trains are late, what trains are coming.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.240]   Oh, interesting.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.000]   Don't mind if they did that, but I'm glad that they did.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   Very cool.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   Very cool.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.080]   Preview is an amazing app, isn't it?
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.000]   With many surprising features.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.720]   Time now for our picks of the week.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.200]   Let's start with Rich Segal of Bearbone Software.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.240]   I owe my presence on the show today to one thing.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.840]   And it is my pick of the week.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.560]   It is this.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.800]   It is the black blood of the earth.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.600]   Do you drink it or pour it on your body?
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.120]   I would eat through the skin.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.200]   White shoes.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:58.720]   The black blood of the earth is a cold, cold-brewed extract of coffee.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.720]   I'll just read off the bottle.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.240]   This is because you live in Rhode Island.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.920]   When you grew up on that foxes you bet or whatever that was, the syrip, what is the coffee syrup
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.000]   you get in Rhode Island only?
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.440]   There are two brands and it's actually the subject of gang wars here.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   Exactly.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440]   Eclipse.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.440]   Yes.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440]   An autocrat.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.440]   I'm an autocrat kind of guy.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.440]   Oh, we can't be friends anymore.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.760]   You're an eclipse guy?
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.440]   What is wrong with you, dude?
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.440]   Oh, everything.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.520]   Where do I begin?
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.200]   So these things are the most bizarre and you can only get them in Rhode Island.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:33.800]   So it's coffee concentrate, highly sweetened.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.720]   It's the condensed milk of coffee.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:36.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.040]   Coffee syrup is yes.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.640]   And you pour it into a glass of milk and it makes coffee milk, which is very popular
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.640]   in Rhode Island.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.840]   They love the coffee milk.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.040]   In fact, in elementary school they don't have chocolate milk.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.040]   They have coffee milk.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.040]   Coffee milk, which is great.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.760]   If you ever seen kids hopped up on coffee and sugar together.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.320]   How is it?
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.640]   Is this what if you grew up on coffee milk?
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.440]   Is this where you end up at the funranium labs and store?
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.960]   No, this has nothing to do with coffee syrup.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.840]   The Black Bloody Earth is a cold brewed coffee extract.
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.920]   It is a-- I'll just read the label because he says it pretty well.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.440]   It's a cold extraction concentrate of single geographic coffee varietals from around the
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:24.160]   world in the interest of not damaging or masking the delicate flavors with cream and
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   sugar.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:31.520]   Now, the interesting thing about this stuff is that because he cold extracts it, it leaves
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.400]   behind all the acids that make coffee bitter and make you want to sweep it.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.640]   But the other thing is that in terms as a means of caffeine ingestion, it's volumetrically
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.240]   extremely efficient.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:50.920]   So it burns your esophagus as it goes down?
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.000]   No, because there's no acids in it.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.320]   He left the acids out.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.000]   He left them out.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.720]   So all you get are the things that make coffee great in a pretty highly concentrated form.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.640]   This bottle was actually full this morning.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.840]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.360]   How many milligrams of caffeine is that?
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.080]   Well, this is a fifth.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.000]   This is a 750 milliliter bottle.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.280]   Taking a fifth of coffee.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:21.600]   But it's a bad idea, really pretty bad idea to drink more than four ounces of this stuff
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.600]   in a day.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.000]   It's $40 worth for one thing.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   For one thing.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.160]   So yeah, a single bottle of this lasts me one month or two, I think.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.160]   OK.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.600]   Do you dilute it or you drink it straight?
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.800]   It depends on how much of a hurry I'm in.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.400]   Sometimes I will use it to fortify my morning coffee.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.040]   I'll brew a couple of shots of espresso and add a shot of this and a little milk because
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040]   it's always--
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.040]   This stuff is insane.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.480]   Oh, it's great.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:56.600]   He says, "By my calculations, you have the equivalent of a month and a half worth of
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.680]   Starbucks Venties in that bottle."
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.240]   So how do you cold extract it?
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.240]   I'm curious.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.240]   That's intriguing.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.640]   If you look on this website, he's got pictures.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:12.520]   He's got a very intricate and to some people, beautiful apparatus.
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.720]   He grinds the coffee.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.320]   He adds water.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.600]   He brews it down.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.120]   And I think I forget what he said is production is something like nine liters a week or something
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.000]   like that of different varieties.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.040]   And he bottles it and ships it.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.200]   This is the hardest core thing I have ever seen.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   It's serious.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.880]   It's very serious.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:43.520]   There is a consumer cold brewing thing called a toddy.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.480]   I can look that up.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:56.280]   So he has a comparison between regular coffee and a BBOTE or black butt of the earth.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.480]   Cold water steeping followed by vacuum extraction leaving the grounds almost as dry at the end
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.400]   as when they started.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:09.240]   Therefore, less acid, less staining, no brown teeth.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:15.200]   The oil has been removed from the coffee bean but not the acid.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:22.200]   And wow, we're talking he doesn't say how many milligrams of caffeine but it's not an
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.440]   insignificant amount.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440]   It's great stuff.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:33.960]   And if you enjoy coffee and or are a serious caffeine addict, he says drink responsibly.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.680]   No more than 100 milliliters, three and a half ounces a day.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:38.680]   Yep.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.160]   So you really could get you could go into into the in the fibrillation with this.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.800]   So you might run into toxicity issues.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.680]   It's well, I mean, if you drank too much, it's possible to over indulge in anything,
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.680]   right?
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.800]   But it's it's great stuff.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800]   It's very flavorful.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.880]   If you enjoy the flavor of coffee, or if you.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.600]   But I put cream and sugar in my coffee.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.120]   I know that's anathema.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.440]   But again, I've been spoiled by a articrat for many years.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:14.360]   Well, if you if you try if you try this with a little milk, you know, that's okay.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.360]   That's allowed.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   I'm ordering some right now.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.360]   Enjoy it.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   Try it.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.240]   We're serving this at Twit from now on forget the wine and beer and whiskey.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.640]   It's the black blood of the earth from now on.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.640]   That's right.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.840]   This is this is great stuff.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.440]   And I highly endorse this product.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:41.560]   Right now he's doing a Peruvian or you could get a Rwandan.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.280]   So these are all single quatamala.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.760]   Which do you like?
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:55.080]   Well, I've had a sampling of things so far and I'm on a bottle of the Rwandan right now.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.280]   And it's very it's very nice.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.000]   The abba kundakawa.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.920]   Yeah, I you could try the sampler.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.560]   They have a 50 dollar limited run sampler.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.920]   These look like vials of blood.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   Oh my goodness.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:20.480]   Well, they are in a very real sense.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   Holy cow.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.480]   I'm ordering this.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   We'll do it.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   We'll do it on the show.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.240]   We'll do it as soon as it comes.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.240]   Have a tasting.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]   Rich.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.720]   Especially if you've got coffee fiends in the house.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.720]   We do.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.720]   We live on coffee, right?
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.080]   I mean, remember, it's it's unsweetened.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.080]   It's unflavored.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.640]   It's just what comes out of it.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   Right.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:45.040]   So, you know, they have this comes with death wish, which is a soul blackening dark roast.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.960]   Guadalmala and Mundo novo medium roast and Colombian Paez medium roast and then the
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.240]   Rwandan plus two vials of mystery will be chosen by my capricious whim.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.400]   Rich, I think you're great, but I understand why the universe led you to our show today.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.400]   Yes.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.400]   Yes.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:12.040]   The universe has led us to the black blood of the earth.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.360]   Is there anything else you recommend?
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.200]   Is there a special consumption device, perhaps a syringe?
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.600]   Do I do not recommend injecting this?
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.680]   You should consume it orally as 50 milliliters per aura per day.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.200]   And Burke and our chat room is wondering, do you need to wear a shirt?
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:33.880]   Wear gloves when you're touching this brew.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:39.240]   If you spill the death wish, you may wish you had, but the rest of it is fine.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.040]   Do not spill on its way to your gullet.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.960]   That's right.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.880]   Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.520]   I don't know if you could top that one.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:57.040]   I believe I'm hoping that like if you do get this in the office for the entire day, I want
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.800]   to have a little indicator on all Twitter broadcast indicating how much of this Leo has
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.800]   had.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.160]   That's a great idea.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:06.320]   This is this puts five hour energy drink in the backseat.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.920]   I mean, this is not this is this is for serious people.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.960]   Have you ever tried pocket coffee?
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.960]   Yes.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960]   I know about pocket coffee.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.440]   So this is like a shot of espresso wrapped in chocolate so you can actually.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.440]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.440]   I'm like, okay.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.440]   Yeah, love it.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.920]   Sometimes I just eat the beans whole because I find I just want to.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.400]   But this sounds like they've done all the work for you.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.680]   It sounds like pre chewed coffee.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:32.000]   It sounds like they need to sell this from an offshore island.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]   Sure, they are.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.720]   This is a Jonathan Colton mad scientist guy I could tell.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.440]   And then then eight years from now, everyone turns into like animal man.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.120]   It was just all a dive awful.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.840]   You know, for 250 bucks, you can buy a 350 milliliter rugged Stein of science.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.840]   I don't know.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:50.840]   Do you have one of these rich?
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.480]   No, I don't have any of the Steins.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.760]   They look appealing, but I haven't found an excuse to get one yet.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.200]   It's fairly expensive.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.280]   They have a 4900 milliliter one.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.520]   What would you put in that?
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.520]   Everything.
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.520]   I see.
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.520]   Here's my coffee.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:11.520]   I see.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.520]   Hmm.
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.120]   But you wouldn't want to fill it up with his stuff.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:19.680]   Well, no, the Stein keeps things cold.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:21.560]   The Stein keeps things cold or hot.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.200]   I mean, you could brew hot coffee into it.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.760]   But I think the Stein was originally conceived for cold drinks such as beers and soda.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.080]   They also have a brass.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.560]   Oh, that's very steampunk.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.120]   I think I do need to order that.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.520]   Yeah, he's got some lovely gear there.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.520]   But not required.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.520]   No.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.000]   No, the two are completely separate.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.360]   The black blood of the earth and the Steins of science are not related.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:53.120]   This is I'm going to send this to Steve Gibson for his five shot Venti lattes.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.640]   This is a 1000 milliliters shiny Stein of science.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.520]   Here we go.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.520]   You want the 4300 milliliter full metal jacket Stein of science.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.520]   You think so?
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.520]   That's the one I really want.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.320]   Yeah, that's like a week's worth of beer.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.720]   1000 is a little more than one really should.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.600]   But it will it will stay cold all the way down.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.320]   Holy cow.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.440]   You have taken your first step into a larger and more jittery world.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.600]   I do feel like my eyes have been opened.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.240]   All right, I'm sorry.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.240]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.280]   Well, this now I openly I openly admit this sounds profoundly lame and compared to the
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.960]   majesty of the black.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:37.480]   But I'm before the black blood of the earth.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.960]   This is a really cool utility from hack the planet.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.360]   It's called the Google it's a Google book down loader.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.720]   It got some publicity.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.240]   I think I'm going going this morning.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.000]   What it is, it's a very, very simple utility that will take a URL to any book that's on
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.720]   Google books, like any free book on Google books, and it will download it and turn it
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:46:00.040]   into a PDF so that if you buy those old copies of popular science, those old copies of spy
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.440]   magazine, and you want to turn them into ebooks that you can then put on your iPad, one click
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.440]   done.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.440]   That is nice.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.720]   And of course it does make it work on the iPad, which is absolutely a great reason to
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.880]   do this.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:15.880]   And Google's offering 25 cent books right now.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.880]   This is a good time.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:23.120]   I've only used it on books that are free downloads.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.720]   I've been in a type in the URL into the browser and you'll be able to read it online through
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:31.880]   the online Google books reader without paying any money.
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.160]   But it really is a one shot tool.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.640]   When you open it, when you run the app, you just see a very, very skinny little window
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.240]   with just what's the URL and then a button to click.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.240]   Cool.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.240]   It works.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.280]   I don't believe it works in commercial titles or probably kind of be achieved if it did
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.160]   work on commercial titles.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.800]   I have a couple of picks.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.080]   I'll tell you what, I'm going to save this one because the chat room just told me about
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.640]   it and I haven't played with it much.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.400]   Call Movie 360, but somebody in the chat room said this is a really cool iPad or iPhone
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.320]   program for making movies that has filters.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.760]   So look at the sketch filter.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.720]   You can actually, it turns what you're shooting a movie of into a sketch, has other features
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.680]   as well, including built-in zoom.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.200]   So you can do incremental zoom as you're shooting, which is kind of cool.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.240]   I'm really serious about using the iPad as a filmmaking tool.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240]   So that might be a fun one.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:26.200]   I'll tell you what, I'll review that next week because this week I want to show you
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.600]   something that is going to get me in such great shape.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   I'm so excited.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.720]   It's called Zombies Run.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:34.040]   Now you won't use this on an iPad.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.800]   I'm going to show it on an iPad because it's a big screen.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.880]   This is for the iPhone.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:43.480]   I've already purchased a special iPhone holder for my arm.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.120]   This is a running program.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:51.280]   So the idea, and I need this because I need motivation, motivation to get any exercise
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:56.440]   at all, the idea is this simulates an zombie attack.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.640]   And so you'll hear them gaining on you as you slow down.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.880]   You have to speed up to get away from them.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.400]   The, we'll play a little bit of this.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.080]   I played it I think another another time.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.320]   So you have, here's your choices.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.600]   You can have the music if you want to listen to your music in addition.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.960]   So you can pick a music playlist.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.120]   You get to turn this, I would suggest using the zombie chases.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.760]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:20.560]   So a whole, a whole story starts to develop.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.680]   So you'll see the township as we look round.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   Not much more than a few fences to keep the zombs out.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.040]   Tiny little line of humanity.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.040]   So this is the setup.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.040]   You're going to jog for a few minutes as you get the setup.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:37.520]   And then as she will tell you, turn left, turn right, go farther, run over there.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:44.920]   And your goal is, your goal is to collect objects, virtual objects as you run around.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.080]   So it uses the GPS.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.160]   It makes it, it's all made up.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.840]   But this is incentive to run like your life dependent on it.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.240]   Now obviously you want to be very careful.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.640]   You can do this on a, apparently I haven't tried it, but it will work on a treadmill in
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.200]   the gym.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.360]   But I want to strap this on and run outside.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.120]   Maybe put a helmet on.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.800]   Be careful if you're using this in traffic.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.800]   Might be better to do this in a park.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:11.880]   But doesn't that seem like fun?
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:19.040]   You get a whole, you get a whole, you know, you collect supplies, you encounter mobs,
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.960]   you get your pace, your time, the whole run.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:31.000]   This is a way to really incent you to, this is the town you'll be running around.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.040]   That's a really incent you to get some exercise.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.840]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:36.080]   So I'm going to start doing this.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:42.360]   And if I suddenly appear fit and thin, it'll be because I'm drinking the blood of the black
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.320]   blood of the earth and, and fleeing zombies.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.040]   And I'll owe it all to you, Rich Segal.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:56.840]   This is a zombies, a comma run, exclamation markets available on the store, obviously.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:03.800]   Rich Segal is the creator of the absolute best editor ever for the Macintosh for OS 10 BB
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.800]   edit.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.800]   We didn't even, I think the last time you run, we talked a little bit about the App Store
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:12.000]   versus because you have, do you have App Store versions and non-App Store versions?
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.240]   Yes, we do today.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.240]   Yep.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.440]   And, and because of the limitations of the App Store, the feature sets are different,
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.440]   right?
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:24.160]   Yeah, there are a couple of small differences because of some of the technical restrictions
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:29.480]   in the App Store. And we've worked around those by providing some outboard components
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.960]   for the command line tools.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.160]   And, and so, you know, it's, it's a little bit of an inconvenience if it's something
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:38.040]   that you run into, but it's not an insurmountable problem.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:41.800]   I hate to admit it, but I love buying stuff on the, on the App Store because it's updated
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.800]   automatically.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.800]   You know, I just, it just seems easier.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.800]   It's very convenient.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:50.520]   You know, 99.44% of the time, not an issue.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.720]   All right, so I'm going to, I already have a license for BB Edda, but I'll buy it on the
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:54.720]   App Store now.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:55.720]   Okay.
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:01.960]   Version 10 is up, 10.1.1, $50, the best editor, but there is a free one called Text Wrangler.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.920]   You can get that from barebones.com.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:11.360]   And you're Jimbo, which is a really fantastic database filing notebook style program to
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:15.320]   keep track of all of the bits of information in your life is also available on the App Store
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.320]   version three.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.320]   You're digital junk drawer.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.320]   Yes.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.080]   We all have them.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.800]   And now you can make it elegant.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.240]   Thank you so much for joining us, Rich.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:24.240]   I'm so sure.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   Thanks for having me, Leo.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:28.800]   I do believe you have changed my life with the Black Blood of the Earth, first with bare
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.320]   bones and BB Edda, and now with the Black Blood.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.040]   Twice you've changed my life.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:39.760]   And the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make any clips drinker out of you.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.760]   No.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.760]   Sorry.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.320]   There's some, I have to draw the line somewhere.
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.520]   Actually, you cannot get either out here and, and somebody brought me some autocrat and
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.800]   I just blew my mind because I hadn't tasted it since fifth grade.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.560]   Now we can fix that.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.560]   I'll send you a little bit of the clip.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.560]   No, no, I don't need it.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.640]   I got Black Blood of the Earth.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:00.720]   I'm shaking, just thinking about it.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:07.160]   Annie Inaco writes for the Chicago Sun Times, his website, www.cub.ob.com, add Inaco and
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.320]   his review of the iPad just went up on the Sun Times site.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.960]   Must read, must read.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:13.960]   Thank you so much, Andy.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.400]   Always a slice.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.480]   Great to have you.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.480]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.360]   We do Mac break weekly Tuesdays and let's Apple sprues with us.
