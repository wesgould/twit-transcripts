[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I'm Leo LaPortz with me Alex Lindsey from the Picsul Corps,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   back from Detroit, the Motor City.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Hello.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Hey Alex, welcome back.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   We missed you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   How's it going?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   From PodcastingTricks.com and the iLifeZone
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and TricksTricks and TricksForKids.com.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Scott Borne.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Hi Scott and Merlin Mann of 43folders.com.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   We were just measuring earlier.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We all had it whipped out and we were saying who had the most
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   traffic and the hits, but I got to say I'm pretty impressed with
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   what did you say?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   One and a half million.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   No, that's crazy talk.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   You're lumber way out, lengths and circumference doesn't mind.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I got nothing here.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I got nothing.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   No, it's interesting because it's actually I propose what we'll
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   be talking about today.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   As Podcast Expo comes up this week, a lot of people talk about
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   numbers, a lot of numbers are thrown around and I'm of the
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   opinion that these things are all worthless.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We don't know anything.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   We have no right.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Absolutely right.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's a cargo cult.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There's absolutely no way to figure this stuff out.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The big story of the week at least for Podcasters, I don't know
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   how much of a story it is for Podcast listeners, less so for
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   people who don't listen to podcasts.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We presume that those of you listening are not in that
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   category.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Apple sending a cease and desist order to a company called
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Podcast Ready.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Podcast Ready makes a podcast client called MyPotter.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now I could see maybe Apple would not like the name MyPotter
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   since it sounds like iPod, but apparently in the cease and desist
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   order to make a podcast.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's number one.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   A lot of people don't understand trademark law.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's easy to get mad at Apple because they have a reputation
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   for being heavy handed here and there.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But when you have a trademark, I own a few myself.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   You have to defend it by law or else you can lose it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So some of what they were doing was simply what they have to do by law.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Some of it was mischaracterization by some of the people
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   reporting on this, thinking that they were going after the word podcast.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We've looked at what the documents say.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They don't appear to be going after the word podcast.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   If they were to go after the word podcast, all the lawyers I spoke with yesterday think that the United States trademark and patent office wouldn't give them the trademark.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And there's quite a bit of legal wrangling that could be done if they decided to head down that road.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Now I know you like the word I believe in that case.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah, we could talk about it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But you know, it is in the dictionary.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's kind of hard to try to trademark a word that is now accepted by Merriam Webster as just a generic word.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And that's part of their legal problem.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   There is some of the legal doctrines that govern this say that when a word is commonly used to describe things like that, it's very tough to get the trademark.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Never the less.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   They are.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And as you pointed out, have to go going after people who infringe on their iPod trademark.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yes, they have to do that or else they could lose it.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Now, you know, sometimes they go a little overboard in my opinion.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   They have the discretion to decide who's really a threat and who isn't.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Now there is some interesting case law that these attorneys provided to me that I really thought kind of might buoy up the podcasting community in the vent that Apple were to start throwing its weight around it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I'm not saying that they are.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But if they were, there's actually laws that protect smaller companies from bigger companies just doing that thing.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And so, you know, if Apple were to threaten somebody, you know, a slap law of some kind that would.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Yeah, they could actually find themselves on the wrong end of that judge's gavel.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And you know, people accuse me because I did put a post up saying, well, let's just call it netcast.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   People accuse me of being a coward saying fight, Apple.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah, but that's not the point.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's not about whether you're going to fight Apple or not to me.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Well, I think that actually it's really it brings up this issue that I think you're having to some degree and I know that we're having is for instance, the full version of Mac break isn't even compatible with an iPod.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You know, so why are we calling it a podcast at all?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You know, and I think that more than anything else, this kind of brings up what should we be calling it a podcast?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Should we be, you know, because a lot of the stuff, even a lot of stuff that Apple's now putting out, whether it's movies or whatever, may not be able to be put on an iPod.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That's not the end goal for a lot of the future of content, you know, video content anyway.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And it can be played on so many different places.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Why are we calling it, you know, only after one of them?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It does seem to confuse people.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I mean, I talk to people all the time who say, oh, but I don't have an iPod.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I'd love to listen to your show, but I don't have an iPod.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Right.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   That's of course that, you know, why can't we just call them a show?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Who are those people?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Well, it's a show, but I think it's a show is so generic.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's nice to indicate somehow that this show comes in over the internet is, you know, available on demand on a variety of devices, not just an iPod, but a computer, a cell phone, CD-ROM.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   A lot of people listen on CD-ROM, they burn it to CD-ROM.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Part of the problem is the same problem as you have with web logs, where, you know, like any kind of a movement like this.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   For the longest time, you can kind of slap everything with the same label because they, because basically because they all represent the same kind of change from whatever came before them.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And for, you know, this always happens this way.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You can look at, I've mentioned before, you know, you always kind of base your idea of something on the technology that it's attempting to replace.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And so, you know, everybody thinks of podcasts as being like radios, and, you know, in the 50s they thought everything in the future was going to look like TVs.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And so, you know, I think there's, I think there's something to be said for coming up with a better title for this.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's a shame that that has to, the conversation has to happen at the same time as Apple's fighting this first world problem they've got.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   People, I don't blame, I don't really blame Apple. I mean, I think Scott, you're right, they're just defending the trademark.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I don't think they have any goal of, and would be stupid if they did.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I mean, they've gotten, just as podcasting has benefited from the association with Apple and the iPod, they've benefited in reverse.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And certainly it'd be a lot of bad publicity if they were to come after a bunch of independent broadcasters who have no money.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, the other thing is there's a lot of these words that people are suggesting is alternatives are already trademarked.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah, netcast is okay. CBS is using it for their, in fact, interestingly has been for a while using it instead of the word podcast.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And netcast is a sufficiently generic word that I don't think, I don't, I think it's even more generic than podcasting.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So I think you're probably all right with that.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I think it's, I think it's an interesting opportunity though because just to follow up on that blog point, I mean, there was a point when, you know, Rebecca Blood, Jason, Kotki, of, like, whoever, all these people kind of had, you know, these personal kind of journals and we all called them blogs.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Well, today, you know, as the daily code is the same thing as boy and boy is the same thing as Ariana.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Right. Right. Right. Right.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So these are all, I mean, there's been a lot that we're getting to the point where the word web log is becoming less and less meaningful as if that were possible.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   We've outgrown it though. Right. I mean, we don't need it anymore.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yeah. So, but you've nailed it exactly, which is so the joke I always made, I used to say that, you know, a web log is basically a home page and a tuxedo t-shirt.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And to me, a podcast for a long time was an MP3 radio show to most people. So I think there is value in being clearer about what, you know, so what it is we're talking about.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   What are we talking about? There's a big difference between the kind of stuff Alex makes with interactive video versus, you know, some kid, you know, I've never been, I've never been comfortable calling a video cast up a podcast.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   That doesn't seem right at all. And vidcast works for me or, I mean, but I don't know.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I don't like the sound of it, but I don't like odd cast either. Some people have suggested that for podcasts.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You know, I think that what I'm also looking at is that when I think of blogs, you know, I have to admit that to me, they don't, you know, for the most part, the word blogs, there are certain blogs that I actually, you know, go and look at a lot.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But there's, but I don't think of it the same as like CNN, you know, CNN.com or whatever.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And I think that it's important for us to start distinguishing something in the same way podcast has that kind of smaller feel to it that is home here and fun and more fun.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   But if you're trying to make a business out of it, I think moving past that I think is really important.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Now, are we, I mean, look, this is a little incestuous. I don't think our audience really cares. We're spending a lot of time on it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I think as podcasters we care and certainly we're going to talk about it at Podcast Expo this week.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I'm going to raise it, obviously, in my speech. I don't care if it's neck cast.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I'm not, you know, for my, for my purposes, I could call it a Twitcast for your purposes.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   You could call it a Pixelcast. I mean, right, you know, the name is not that important.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   But I think it is an opportunity to have this discussion, which I think is a good thing, which is, is podcast the right name.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Have we outgrown it? It's early and we're not as mature as blogs.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Maybe we don't need a uniform. Do you think Merlin, we just don't even need a name for all of these things?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, I don't know. I mean, these kinds of things, like you say, they mature in time, but I kind of like the idea of, well, I mean, the obvious thing is let's maybe get away from the word cast.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You know, obviously that's had some resonance because of broadcasting and then podcasting and it rhymes, which people like.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   But I mean, you know, I don't know. I'm terrible at naming this kind of stuff. But I think I agree with you, though.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I think it's a good time to have this conversation. And to Alex's point, I mean, there's absolutely, I mean, you know, Nick Denton and some kid with a blog spot account are, you know, that's a good thing.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You know, there's a whole lot of difference going on there on all kinds of levels and calling those both blogs at a certain point, you know, obviously becomes less meaningful.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   As podcasters and podcast listeners, I think we do have a reasonable issue, which is nobody, you know, the majority of the world does not yet know about podcasting.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I want them to know about podcasting as listeners. I think you should want them to know about podcasting because the more this gains traction, the more they'll be, the quality will improve.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It's just it's just it's just it's a becomes a more important medium. Just as people who read blogs have a vested interest in blogging succeeding, I think listeners have an interest in podcast succeeding.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And I think that, you know, maybe the word isn't serving us very well anymore. You had some opinions, Scott, about this. What should we call it?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You've been broadcasting a long time.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Yeah, I actually kind of like your word to tell you the truth. Somebody suggested audio cast, but I'm actually part of a part of a group.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Well, I was part of a group that owns the trademark to that. Well, so you have to talk to me. You want to use that?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Well, and you have net radio. So net is a name you like.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Yeah, net radio is a trademark that I originally made and I don't own the company anymore. And so I don't have to worry about that. But yeah, I like net cast a lot.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And I got to tell you, I think, frankly, with you having the juice, you do Leo, if you decide it's net cast, a lot of us will follow.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Well, I don't want to be Don Quixote here either. I mean, you're not chasing any wind bills. You're just naming a podcast. I'm going, I'm going to go over that hill. You all follow me now.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Hey, you're not going to be the father of net casting. Oh, that's good. All right. See, we got a hot father. Now we need a net father.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I have. I did rename all the change all my signage on the site just for fun to net cast is easy enough to do.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And we still have the the Twitch sounder, which says Paul Garst, true love. But I've asked Jim Cutler who cut that originally to change it to net cast.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   So, you know, I mean, just for fun. I don't think it really matters that much. I'm not trying to create a movement here.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Famous last words. No, I mean, I have nothing to gain by that. And I'm perfectly willing for two things to happen. One, three things to happen. One, we don't change it all. It's podcasting.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I think that's the most likely outcome. Two, we do decide in a new name, whatever it is. That's fine. I'll go along with it. It doesn't have to be net cast.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Three, maybe, maybe just as likely, it fragments and there are, because what it's really, you're right, Alex. What you do is not a podcast.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I mean, Mac break is not a podcast. Why should it be called one?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Well, and I think it's going to be important for us as especially as we do more shows like Mac break and more things that are like that to start distinguishing ourselves from everything else that's floating around or for business reasons.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And when you, so my problem with part of this is that that with all of these sorts of distinctions in the early days, it's so heavily based on the least important part of it, which is the way that it's delivered.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Maybe it's not the least important. No, but you're right. It does focus on that. Yeah.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Like every week I download inside the media two days before it's broadcast in San Francisco. So I listen to the podcast of Inside the Media, which is identical except for the intro.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   I get Garrison Keeler's writer's Almanac every like a few hours before it's on the radio.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Well, is Tivo TV? Well, is Tivo TV? Is IPTV TV? Is it useful to make the distinction? I think right now in the early days it is useful because that tells the consumer who's interested where to go.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It could be, but I mean, like, we're probably, this is a terrible rat hole to go down, but I mean, I'm with you though on the point about having it cleft so close to the iPod.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I mean, you know, I think we, I think you were at one point. That was a mistake. And everybody knew it was a mistake of the day it happened. I mean, but we were stuck with it.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I want to jump in here because I want to do something I know Leo won't. That is, I want to announce that our friend Leo is the podcaster of the year.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That caster, please. And that's what I was just going to say where this becomes relevant is that if you were to win this award again next year, Leo, they would have to change the name for you.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   But I want to congratulate you on winning. And I do think you're a thought leader in this space. And I think it's important that we have the conversation. But I also think you're right. We've probably talked about it in this.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Yeah. And I don't, and I really want to make clear that I'm not trying to impose net cast by any means. I don't, I don't believe I have, or anyone has the cloud to do that. But if we can reach a consensus, that would be great.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I vote for it. Leo cast. Leo cast. That's it. That's it. Leo cast. I just got all this podcast. No ego there. Is it?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Thank you for listening to Leo cast. Who is this Leo? And why is it? Leo cast.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Well, let's talk about something that's in Scott Born's backyard. Aperture 1.5. I guess I was wrong proclaiming it dead two weeks ago.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Oh, we're not getting off nearly that easy. I want you groveling.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I fired everybody, didn't they? You were out here proclaiming gloom and doom. And I've just been waiting for this moment. I knew it was coming.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And you are absolutely going to get it. No, it's 1.5. It's great news. Obviously Aperture's not dead. And man, first of all, it's a free upgrade.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And it's really equivalent of almost a 2.0 upgrade. That's the best news. Yeah, it's unbelievable. They did away with all the things that made people upset.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   You no longer have to manage a controlled library in one space. A lot of people didn't like that. I think it's fine, but people didn't care for it.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So that's gone. You can now look at offline media. That's something you couldn't do before. They've speed it up everything and it will run.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Get this on any Intel Mac now. Even a MacBook. Even a Mini. It'll run on a Mini. Yeah.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   So before it didn't have thumbnails, so you couldn't look at stuff that was offline, but now it did have thumbnails, but you had to have the library open and accessible.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Now you can store those pictures on a DVD anywhere you want. That's pretty critical, isn't it? I mean, you've got to be able to do that.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It is for people that do a lot of work. It is critical. You can now have offline media. The library still shows you a thumbnail.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And what's cool is you can even make your edits to the thumbnail. Wow. And then when you actually bring the library online, it'll render it.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Well, does this kill Lightroom then? Well, keep in mind Lightroom is just a beta. Lightroom, interestingly enough the day before revved out beta four.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And Lightroom has always been a couple of steps behind aperture, in my opinion. Aperture is a mature application. We can count on it. Lightroom, they're putting out disclaimers that say, "Hey, don't count on this thing yet because we may change everything."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I think it's just way too early to pass on Lightroom. I'm glad it's out there because I think that the more people in the space, the better photographers are.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And all these programs run on Macs, so that's good news for our audience that are into Macs. But I'll tell you, if you're a serious photographer, aperture is something that's definitely worth a look.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And I'm not just saying that because you run ApertureTricks.com. I'm not because I started running ApertureTricks.com the day the program was released because I decided it was a good piece of art.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I'm just a fan from day one. Can I have some Tabasco sauce with my crow or do I have to use stray? No, you're fine. I'm three beaten up.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   One of the things I wanted to get it in there. One of the things I think is actually pretty cool also is the plug-in architecture.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   So there's an API now for companies like iStock Photo. And they've already iStock Photo, I believe Getty and a couple other of the services.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So you can tag all of your stuff while you're sitting in Aperture and then export that stuff out.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And this is something that really makes it easier. I'm just starting to get into putting stuff up on iStock Photo.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And we'll actually doing some video stuff for the video side. But being able to tag all that stuff is just a pain in the neck.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And being able to do that while you're working and be able to pass all that stuff on I think is more than a small improvement to the situation.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And it's exciting to see Apple release APIs ever because it's always like pulling teeth to get them to let us actually play.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   It was a big bone of contention, Alex. Early on we had Joe and the Aperture project lead with us when Derek Story and I taught it at Macworld.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And he told me he said about half the company doesn't want it and half does. There's always that battle inside Apple or whether or not to open up anything.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And the fact that we do have that API as limited as it is, it's mostly an export API.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   We still can't get functionality in terms of new plugins to do filters and such.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   But at least we're down that road. And they launched with like six or seven companies already taking advantage of it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So that's really interesting. I stock photo, Pictage, Flickr, Connected Flow. That's quite a few.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's kind of neat actually. And it just allows you to integrate with those things much more seamlessly.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I just want to point out, this is a frustrating part of Apple that I think that Apple, I'm hoping somebody in Apple is actually listening to this.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   That it really I think slows down the adoption of a lot of their software when they don't make it easy for people to develop extra stuff for it.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I think they know that. I think they've got to know that. I'm surprised that there's dissension internally.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   But it's obvious. I mean, you know, there's there's not really for a long time there wasn't any way to build anything for iMovie.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   There wasn't any way to build it. I can see if there are technical reasons it's a difficult thing to do.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'm I'm I don't understand in this day and age how anybody could have a philosophical position that that's a bad idea.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   You know, they just don't want to do it because they don't want to be locked down to having you know, they don't want to be locked down to an infrastructure.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   They want to be able to change the infrastructure as they want to without having developers upset.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But even as I mean, and I have to say as DV as we are developers, you know, I mean, we we actually sell products and we don't mind changing the stuff.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   We just would like to have more, you know, have to have that stuff deeper and it's been.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   But you look at when good but the companies now in the web 2.0 space like Google have done by giving an API by creating an API.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It's just so powerful. I don't know why somebody would in this day and age say, well, what a bad idea that is.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Apple's getting better. I mean, like, Apple's getting better. The the FX plug is it was an exciting plugin that was only available in motion.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And now whenever Final Cut Pro 512 comes out, you'll be able to have FX plugs working within Final Cut Pro, which will be, you know, really, really exciting for us.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But it'll also be exciting for a lot of plugin developers because it's a half a million user market that is going to open up and be a much more robust format.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So they're doing a little bit of it, but I think that Apple doesn't go nearly as far as they need to.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Because, I mean, one of the reasons that one of the ways that things get locked in to systems that people start using them is because of all those additions.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Because of all that stuff, your team can only be so big building the core app.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I mean, and that's what that's what made Photoshop such a big deal is all those plugins, you know, and being able to get them.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I mean, that's that's one of the reasons it was it became part of that standard was because of that plugin architecture.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And so I think that Apple anyway, I'm just that's something that I think is a very weak point in Apple.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   They're getting better at it. And this is a start in aperture, but they really need to give us more more control.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Let us build more stuff for aperture. Anyway.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I got an email from a listener to the show who lives in Malmo, Sweden.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   He is a Phantom Mac break weekly. We were talking about the iPhone.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   One, sir, twice or three, four, five, six times. I want my iPhone. I know.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   He says, I just want to point out the situation in the US regarding cell phones is peculiar.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   In the rest of the world, it's very different. He said, the tying between handsets and operators is less common in Europe.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Here you buy a mobile phone, any phone you want, then you buy a SIM card from a network and you put it in your phone and boom, you're on that network.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   The phone is not linked to the network as it is here in the States, which means I would imagine, I don't know that they pay more for their phones.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I mean, the phone price is heavily subsidized in the US because you're tied to a carrier.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   It's selling you the razor because you're going to be buying the blades for the next three years.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   He heard he says, and this is the thing that I think is interesting.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I've heard from authoritative sources that Apple has been shopping around for a cell phone operating system.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   That would be the case if they were going to make an iPhone they would need an OS with some very specific.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That's what they did with the iPod, didn't they? They went out and bought an operating system or rented an operating system.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   The rumor sites are saying that they just made a deal with Singular to open up the first six months of iPhone service on Singular exclusively.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   As an MVNO?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   No details on the extent of that relationship because it came off of one of the rumor sites.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   We don't know if it's true or not.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   But it is interesting that we're hearing conversations of this nature as if it's just a given.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   We're going to have the phone. Now we're talking about who's going to be the provider.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   What I'm hoping is that we're going to do some kind of hybrid where if we're in a Wi-Fi network, for instance, we can use iChat or Skype or VoIP or whatever.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Then if we don't have that, we can move back and forth.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I'm hoping that given the technology and how far along it is, they're going to give us that kind of...
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   It may not be in the first version, but I think that has to be the next step of the process.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   We talked previously about how, to some extent, the success of the iPod is it must be owed to iTunes and the iTunes store.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   In the scenario of having an Apple phone, what app is the equivalent of iTunes, do you think?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Or does there need to be one?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   I think it's still going to be iTunes. I think we're going to use it as an iPod that we can make phone calls on.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Everybody points out, whenever we talk about this, they say, "Wait a minute, isn't the rocker an iPhone? How is it different?"
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Merely, the iTunes capability is not... I mean, you can get a phone with that. We're talking about a lot more than that.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   The rocker is also limited to arbitrarily, mind me.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Is that that motor limited to a hunched?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   The first iTunes phone.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   It's arbitrarily limited to a hundred songs.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   There's a lot of limitations to it, which Apple, of course, if they're going to do it, aren't going to put up with it.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Well, I think what you want, and I imagine what everybody's thinking, is take your iPod video, put an antenna on it, and a microphone on it, and there's a phone.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Right.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And maybe you have a pad up here from somewhere, but a number pad.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   But that's what you want, is an iPod with phone capabilities, right?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   You're not talking about a phone that could play a hundred songs.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Right.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You want an iPod with phone that interrupts your music if you're getting a call, or if you wanted to.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   The rocker does that.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   I never do, but if ever and rocker do that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But then, the other things, of course, I think that being able to incorporate WiFi, I mean, the Sony now has this little Milo that just came out.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Right.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And we were playing with it at the Sony Store. And it's pretty nifty. I mean, it's a pretty cool...
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   What is it? What's the Milo?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   The Milo is, I think it's mostly for teenagers. I mean, the way it looks and feels.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   But it's got a full keyboard. It's like a flip up. So it flips up and you can do instant messaging.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But it takes WiFi. So you can do VoIP over WiFi if you are in a zone.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Now, we were in the metrian and it was really slow.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   So we couldn't really tell whether that worked. You can also surf the web and you can do a whole bunch of little things with it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It sounds like the, in some ways, the iPhone.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   No, it's definitely that going down that path. It doesn't do any kind of sell. It only does VoIP.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It doesn't have...
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It doesn't look like you looking. I don't think it's very attractive. I mean, there's the pictures I've seen. How did it look in real life?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It was cool. The actually thing is that it felt lightweight. You know, it just felt like I'd break.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Yeah. Yeah. I felt like I was going to break it any moment.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And it was sitting right next to that full screen, that little miniature VIO, which looked way cooler.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Anyway, but I think that going that kind of direction, but more with an Apple, you know, solidness and a full iPod and everything else.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   GPS, I mean, GPS, then they cast it and put into a lot of the stuff in the near future.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And so...
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Sorry, that was the little Milo guy talking.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I'm glad you can make it.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   You can't hear about it.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I want to introduce you to something really, really cool.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Check it out.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It sounds like Merlin. He actually looks like Merlin. Did you know this commercial?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Milo is not what you think it is.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   In fact, it isn't like anything you've ever seen before. For people like you and me, Milo is a total revolution.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Oh, where's my shotgun? I just want to kill this guy. I just want to kill this guy, don't you?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Irritating.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Oh.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   It's not what you're thinking as. It's a total revolution.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Anytime somebody says total revolution, I immediately go...
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I got your revolution up against the wall.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Jeez.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   You just are going to be that guy big time airtime.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It's a paradigm shift, a medium of synergies.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I bet his name is Milo.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Anyway, it's interesting because what you have is a perfect example of a big corporation pretending to somehow understand kids and failing miserably.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   The guy looked like he was 43. It just doesn't...
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I don't want to beat a dead horse because we covered this pretty well last time.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I've been testing these sprint phones that are supposedly multimedia and they're supposedly music players.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   God bless them, I appreciate having the phone to play with.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   They're just the ultimate rack stereo you'd buy at Walgreens.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It's the worst of all worlds.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Nobody loves their phone yet. Does anybody love their phone?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Is there a lovable phone?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Really? But here's the thing. We talked to the last time about what our wishlist items would be for what constitutes an Apple phone.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Maybe I'm just an unrehabilitated fanboy, but I have to imagine that there's going to be something more to it.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   There's going to be something more to this than an iPod with a snap-on because Trio's have done that for a snap-on or a strap-on.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I didn't want to say that.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I don't know where your mind goes.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Banana!
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   No, that's the old safe word.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   But for example, having some kind of a Wi-Fi integration would be great.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   At this point, I'm just... obviously we're just speculating wildly.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I look at stuff like an app that I'm really starting to warm up to is a dressbook, oddly enough,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   and discovering that the more spotlight starts exposing itself in different parts of the OS,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   the more powerful a dressbook starts to become.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I know this sounds a little loopy, but think about... I don't know how much you guys use this,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   but the ability to go in and create smart groups, or for that matter, ad hoc manual groups
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   then gives you a lot of control back in Mail.App for how you can handle things.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I don't know. I just think it's interesting to think about, like, I don't know, iTunes and a phone,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   but from the music integration and having this program called iTunes, I'm not sure I see them next.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   I have a lot of that functionality now. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones called the iCombi.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It pairs... it has a little plug-in that goes into the iPod.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   It pairs with the iPod. You listen to the iPod, they're pretty good headphones.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   The iPod's in your backpack. When my phone rings, it's also a pair to that.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I pick up the phone. It pauses the iPod.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Wow.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I talk on the phone. It's the same headset. It's got a built-in microphone.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   You don't see it. It just looks like headphones.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   There's another button. I hang up the phone and I'm back to music.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   If that's all you want, that's doable. I agree with you, Merlin.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's got to be something a little bit slicker than that.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   There's got to be... I guess I'm just looking for what the zip is back on the Macintosh.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's one thing to create a great device that feels good in your hand and is better to use than...
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Well, I'll tell you, one thing. If it's synced with the frickin' Macintosh,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   that would be a big, big, big plus.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   My biggest problem is, one of my friends of mine, we both have Trio, these Trio 650s.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   We both have decided that we hate our Trio 650 with a passion.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We just hate every other phone more than the 650.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   But the biggest problem that I have is every time I sync, I end up with a whole bunch of new addresses.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I've got like six Leos in my head.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I've avoided that completely. I've got a 700p and I've used Missing Sync and I haven't had a single problem.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I think it's hit or miss. I just think you're lucky, but I think in general syncing, you're sunk.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   It's very hard to...
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Not again, not to drive it into the ground, but I mean then also, how does this feed into these other pieces?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   This is the part that gets so interesting for me is how these little pieces fit together.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   As we said before, Leo, to me, I'm not that interested in going one place to do one thing.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   What I'm interested in is applications that provide functional spackle one to another.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Thinking about how this fits in with the Mac Sync and stuff like that, this starts to get really interesting.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   To me, that's kind of where to watch.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   It's interesting to watch where the applications seem to be headed and then try to figure out,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   you can kind of mentally reverse engineer what might flow out of that.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   It'll be interesting to see in Leper in particular what kind of stuff starts popping up.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   By the way, I hope that someone in Apple is playing with an OKEA N95.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   That is a neat phone.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   That's the only one that you're like, "If Apple..."
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Here's... I'm threatening Apple right now. Here comes the big threat.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   They respond so well to threat.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   They do. They do. They do.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   They do.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   If I don't get my iPhone, by January 12th, I'm going to go buy an OKEA N95.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   N95?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Do you throw your palm at them?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   90 or 95.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   The 95.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   I haven't seen the 95.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   I've seen the 90, which is basically...
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   The 90 looks kind of like a camcorder.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Is this the same port?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   This one looks like a little square phone.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It almost looks like a little iPod.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's got an LCD front.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   It's got a GPS full functionality.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   It's like a TomTom built right into it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   How do we go with the TomTom again?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I love my TomTom.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I love GPS integration.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I love my TomTom.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I have to say that I'm very interested in GPS because I think there's huge business opportunities for building.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I don't know where you're seeing the 95.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Do a Google image search on your smartphone.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   It's so-called leaked pictures.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Is this accurate?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   No, no, no.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   It's on an OKEA site.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Oh, it is.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   It is a 5-megapixel camera.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Support for high-speed networks.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Anyway, it is tasty.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   For me, I'm just kind of waiting.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   As I said, I'm waiting.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I don't want to scare anyone at Apple, but if I don't get my iPhone...
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I scare anyone at Apple.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   By the way, I know that when I start talking, everyone's very little.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   This is the fifth time we've talked about this, guys.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Anyway, I think they've gotten the word yet.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   No, no, I don't think anyone there is listening.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   So, have anyone actually downloaded one of these movies, by the way?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I did.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I downloaded the Life Aquatic with Steve Zissu.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   How long did it take you?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   It's about...
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Let me just check how big it is.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I think it's one and a half megabyte.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Now, I've worked a download in three minutes to realize it was a terrible movie.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   No, I love the...
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   That's a great movie.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Come on.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I actually...
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I love that movie.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Oh, no, that's a great movie.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I didn't walk down to that movie.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Oh, no.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   You probably didn't like Buckaroo Bonsai, either.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Merlin, help me out here.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I do like Buckaroo Bonsai.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I love Buckaroo Bonsai.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   So, how long did it take to...
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Well, I can't give you an accurate number, and I'll tell you why.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   For most of the day, I bought the second season of Lost.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I wanted to see what TV looked like, and I bought Zissu, the hated Life Aquatic.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And for half a day, it kept rejecting me.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It said, "Sorry, I can't get it."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   They're having server issues, big time servers.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Oh, man.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   When it came, it came probably within half an hour.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Wow.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   It took me...
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   But it took all day to get it to that point.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Right.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I downloaded that.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You got to do it in the background.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Nobody's sitting there.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You got to do it at night.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Nobody's sitting there waiting for it.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But this is still, this is a really good point.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   At least, you know, based on my, you know, half-assed theory about the ability to have stuff as quickly as you want it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I mean, it's one thing to be able to get, you know, the night Chicago died off of BitTorrent in three minutes, and it's another thing, you know.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Well, I could get a better quality copy of the Life Aquatic easily from a lot of places, or just add it to Netflix.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   That's right.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I guess the question is...
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   So you're right.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So it's not that it's faster.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   It's legal.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   The quality's not very good.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And I have to say, the quality on TV shows has improved, but the movie's because of the widescreen.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   We're really using like 270 lines.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It's not very good.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Well, I think that...
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I think one of the other issues with the widescreen version is that...
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Well, with the...
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I downloaded it at Enemy of the States, so I was, I was kind of...
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I was watching it and...
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Oh, that's a much better movie.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I...
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's just a say, it's very me.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Bill Murray, Will Smith.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Okay.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's not Bill Murray and Will Smith.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It's Gene Hackman.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Gene Hackman.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Is it Will Smith in the Enemy of the State?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   No, but Gene Hackman is a fan.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Gene Hackman.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I love Gene Hackman.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   No, you're right.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   He's more than...
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Okay.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So anyway, but what's interesting is when you play a DVD, I believe, it actually down...
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   You know, when it jumps in the DVD, it's down-resing you to the lower resolution so that you get kind of a...
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It looks better with...
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   When you're using iTunes, I believe that it's just kind of...
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   It really just stretches it out and you really see this pixel bubbling.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   'Cause I've just watched it.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   So you were able to burn it to a DVD?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I'm just saying that...
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I know I did not burn it to a DVD.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I was just watching it on a DVD.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   What I'm saying is when I watch a DVD that theoretically should be roughly the same resolution.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Oh, it's not done.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   But it's clearly not...
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   There's more compression as well.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I mean, a DVD movie is four gigabytes.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   This is less than two.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Right, but it's not the compression that's the problem though.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   When you look at it, it is the...
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's the small resolution.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It's stair stepping along small lines that you don't normally see as badly.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   At least I don't notice them as much when I watch a DVD.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   So let me get this straight.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Let me get this straight.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It costs about the same as a real DVD.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Doesn't have all the extra bonus stuff.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   You have to wait maybe a day for it to download.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And that's a good thing.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Oh, by the way, it's not quite as good as we would get off of our DVD.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Wait or have another piece of crow, please.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I have some salsa with that.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   But it would be worth...
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   I'm going to enjoy my DVD player again tonight as I drop that old disc in there.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   All right, it is big 15 screen.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I have to say that I'm playing it back on the Apple 30, so it's playing it back on a pretty big screen.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Lost looks good though.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   I mean, the TV shows, the 4x3 TV shows are appreciably better.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I mean, I have the first season of Lost 2.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   There's an order of magnitude improvement in the new ones.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's still not as good as it would be on a DVD, but it's tolerable.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Whereas the movie was noticeably not as good.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I mean, it looked blurry.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And all this stuff is good news because, like I say, two to five years from now, it'll mean something.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   What do you mean?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   This is to whom?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I mean, two to five years from now, when we've had the fifth, sixth, seventh generation,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and each iteration is successively better, then it'll be cool.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Right.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   No, I think you're right.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   But we're--
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And just like you said, we're late adopters, right?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Just like you said, the TV is already better, and I concur.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   So, you know, five generations from now, the TV will be stellar.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Now, did you guys see this thing on Amazon's Unbox?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Corey Doctorow put this up.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I guess this was a little while ago.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   But he's a DRM bigot.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   If you say DRM, he's going to start frothing at the mouth.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I would agree with him, but I mean, of course he hates it.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   No, no, no.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   I mean, it's fine to have that stuff.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Some of the--
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   He's not comparing it to Apple, though.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I mean, he's just talking about it as it is, yes?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   No, no.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And I think that it's just that it's-- you're nearly--
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I just-- I don't understand how I could buy it.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I mean, maybe he just made a good case for me, and I have to go back and actually try to buy it.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Well, Corey, is there's no one better at making the case against copy protection?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Well, I don't mind-- and the thing is, I don't mind copy protection the way--
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   generally the way it's put out in iTunes, but like the agreement that you're signing into
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   in Unbox is basically, you know, if you don't keep on upgrading, you can't play--
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   we could just turn off your video.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   You know, I mean, it's-- you know, that's--
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Right.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You have to keep on upgrading to the newest version.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   That's right.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And I think that this gets back in there.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   You don't-- basically, you don't-- his point is you don't own it.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   You really don't feel like--
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   You don't own it, yeah.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And ultimately, they can reach their long arm out and take it out of your computer.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Right.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And I think that that's a little-- that's a little odd.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I think once people realize it, the real issue is, do people know that, or do they care?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   How does that differ from-- I'm not familiar with Apple's T.O.S., but how does that differ
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   from what Apple lets you do?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   It seems to me that--
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Well, we just-- we just-- I mean, like, unless I'm mistaken, we just got an iTunes update
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   that required a quick time upgrade in order to be able to view our old movies.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   That's right.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But it didn't-- it's not related to the-- I mean, you could still-- if you didn't upgrade,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   you would still be able to watch all of your old stuff.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   So you'd still be able to-- all the stuff you've already bought are the iTunes.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   I don't think that's true.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   You'd still be able to watch it if you didn't upgrade to iTunes.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   No, but no, but you have to get a quick time upgrade, too.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   There's no-- but only if you want to watch the new stuff.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That's because--
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Okay.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   But there's still no guarantee, though.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I mean, at some point, Apple could release a version of quick time.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I just feel like every time I sit down and actually read the T.O.S. for anything, like, I have
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   to put a damp cloth on my head, you know?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   It's just--
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   You don't own your software.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   You don't own your-- you don't own any of this stuff.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Yeah, you own the plastic disk and the right to use it for a little while.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And admittedly, I mean, one of the things Joy said to do-- I mean, to take this with a
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.640]   grain of salt is that, you know, we have released forms of stuff when people join the
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.800]   Pixel Core and all the stuff.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   And they are very heavy-handed.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:40.400]   You know, because, you know, it's-- we're never going to-- PR-wise, we could never actually
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.680]   really push that as hard as the agreement, but what you don't want to do is leave a lot
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   of oxygen.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.280]   You know, and so a lot of this stuff is not leaving any oxygen.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.000]   You know, obviously, if they really turned everybody's movies off because they didn't
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.520]   do that or they didn't-- they did some of these things, you know, I think people would
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.760]   really stop using them.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.280]   You know, it completely would be suicide.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.880]   So all yours always say, "We're writing for the divorce, not the marriage."
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   Right, right.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   That's good.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   That's why I don't have a prenup.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   My wife would--
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   [laughter]
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:14.360]   Anybody get a new Core Duo, Core 2 Duo iMac, the 20-inch, apparently, according to Mac
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.160]   Rumors, they've got an 802.11N card in there.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.320]   Unfortunately, it's the wrong end.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.000]   It's the Broadcom chip, which is the one everybody hates, but they are putting--
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.640]   Why do they hate it?
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:32.520]   Well, there's-- the best-- according to Dvorak and others who know, the best and implementation
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.680]   is from Ergo, they own patents on the MIMO, the real MIMO technology.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:41.080]   Broadcom, in fact, is the one that has been causing problems with the ratification.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.520]   They're the ones who changed it and-- Ergo is now saying that the new draft end causes
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   all sorts of interference.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.240]   Broadcom is saying, "Oh, we can fix that.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   We can fix that."
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.600]   It really isn't the chipset I would put in there.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.680]   We have Broadcoms in our B and our G max, but Ergo makes the best end.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   Interesting.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.640]   According to experts.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.160]   Well, we'll see.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.920]   I guess because they're not advertising it, they don't actually have to commit to it if
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.280]   it doesn't work well.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.680]   Presumably, when you get your ITV, it automatically works with these new MIMACs, right?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   As an end device.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   It sounds like that's what they're up to.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   I bet you that's what they're up to.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.400]   You have to get ahead of it.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.120]   Kind of get ahead of it.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.120]   Right.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.840]   A couple of follow-ups from previous episodes.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.000]   I don't know if I should give his name.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.920]   A fellow who used to work at Apple in the iTunes Music Store support said, "In fact, the
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:43.080]   way Apple does it now, you can actually redownload your music."
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   It's off the record.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   It's an internal policy.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.040]   If you go and ask them, they may not say this, but users are allowed up to...
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.000]   Until April, you were allowed up to three of these one-time exemptions to redownload
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.160]   your music.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.360]   Now you get one one-time exemption.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.480]   I did get an email from a number of people who said, "Yeah, I called Apple or wrote to
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   you Apple."
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:10.600]   One guy said, "The thing to say is that when you're transferring to your new Mac and something
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.520]   went wrong and all of your iTunes songs were lost," he said, "They flipped a switch and
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.160]   they were all available for download from iTunes."
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.400]   Now this fella says one of the reasons iTunes doesn't want to do this, Apple doesn't want
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:29.800]   to do this, is they pay the record label for every file that's downloaded regardless of
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.440]   whether it's a redownload.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   Wow.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.400]   So it's actually costing the money.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.480]   Excuse me one second.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.120]   Apple, this is Merlin Mann.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.920]   I would like to get all my music.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   I'm going to read down a little on my music.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.960]   Yeah, I got all kinds of traction with this guy, it's believing.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.400]   But now I've said this before, but I mean, obviously if it's the record labels that
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.480]   are driving that deal or that particular piece of the deal, then we're at SOL.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.040]   But I think this is something that would be a terrific feature for them to offer, which
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   is...
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   Well, Apple does.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   Well, almost like, "Oh gosh, dare I say," back in the days on mp3.com when you could basically
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.160]   emulate your collection wherever you were.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   I mean, to me that's powerful to be able to say, "I'm on whatever, let's say I bought
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.400]   a new Mac and I'm in a hotel room, I want to be able to download this record I bought
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   one time."
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   Right.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   I mean, the thing is to get into the...
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.160]   I'm allowed to say this once a month, a long tail.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.680]   I mean, they've got all this stuff sitting around on a server somewhere.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.560]   It's just a question of verifying that you're the right owner.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.360]   Well, and that's the case.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.240]   It's audible, I have an audible library of these are spoken word books.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.600]   And I can download anything I've ever bought ever.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.760]   It's all there.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   Anytime anywhere as long as that can be as offer.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.760]   I think...
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   I think...
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.760]   I think...
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   It's a great way to do it.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.760]   It's missing a subtle difference, but I think that's a huge difference.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   If they were to say, "You know what?
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   We're going to be your locker in perpetuity.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.040]   You've got the rights to this until you're in the ground and we're going to hang on to
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   it whenever you need it.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   Just come grab it.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Grab it as much as you want.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   Who cares?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   It's your library.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   I don't think that has anything to do with anything.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   I mean, anything to do with Apple has everything to do with the record companies.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.640]   That's what this guy's saying.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.560]   I think Apple would like to do that, but the record companies actually make them pay for
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   each type of load.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.480]   I used to go out with the girl whose sister worked at the Limited and she told me the
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.400]   dirty little secret of most of the stores in the malls, at least in the mid 80s, which
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.560]   was they made these really crap clothes that would completely fall apart and they had 100%
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   guarantee.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.640]   So people would always come back and bring back their clothes.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.040]   But they always, whenever they came back and did exchanges, they always bought more
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   stuff.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   And so what does this do?
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.800]   I mean, if they could find out a way to work that out, you just get people in the
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.560]   habit of coming back and downloading stuff from Apple, which is exactly the behavior
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.680]   that you want to habituate in people.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.800]   But anyway, find this guy.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.400]   Yeah, I think we're all agreed.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.200]   Apple would like to do this.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.600]   I definitely think so.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.840]   I think at this point, they're lucky that they always feel like they're lucky they can
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.320]   sell music online.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   You know, if it was...
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:54.720]   And by the way, Apple does listen because I got an email from iTunes customer experiencing.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.000]   You don't have to wait till December to Rudy, I saw all your computers will be glad to
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   help.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.040]   But I would never take advantage of my connections as Netcaster of the year.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.800]   Yeah, all we need to do is channel your email account through all of our email accounts.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.520]   We'd all be having things.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.480]   Hello, I am Leo of Leo.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.480]   I have to say.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   Please make my library work.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.520]   You know, I get a lot of email from listeners to the various podcasts, but I get the most
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.960]   interesting and nice as the email from listeners to this podcast.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.560]   And a lot of them are in Apple.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   I mean, it's great.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   We appreciate your listening.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.840]   We're glad to do this.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.200]   By the way, if you have a story for us or suggestion, something you'd like us to see for
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.560]   future shows, Merlin set up a, I think, a clever way to do this.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.920]   All you have to do is if you're a delicious user, and I know in a lot of you are, did
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   you see the...
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   It's delicious.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.480]   Michael Arrington's post that the delicious is something like 5 million users now.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   I think it's 1 million.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   I think they broke 1 million.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   They broke 1 million.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   1 million.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.720]   I'll have to look, but they went up quite a bit ever since their Yahoo acquisition.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.960]   Any event, if you're a delicious, if you have a delicious account, all you need to
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   do is tag at MBW Ideas, Mac Break Weekly, MBW Ideas, and we will be able to see those.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.040]   And we can add that to our list of things to talk about.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.200]   We're not using the four tag because although we have a delicious account, I think it's
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.600]   just easier to use the tag tag.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   Is there...
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.600]   Am I correct, Merelin?
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   You're the delicious expert.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.800]   You can do something for colon MBW Ideas as well.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.280]   Yeah, the nice thing about the four tag...
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   I mean, there's all kinds of little neat things you can do on delicious like this.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.440]   The nice thing about the four tag or the bad thing, I guess, depending on how you look
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.920]   at it, is that only that person will see it.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:44.320]   So for example, I have requested repeatedly begging, "Please, don't email me links.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.360]   Please, please, please make them four colon 43 folders."
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.800]   But then it's private to you.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   It's private to me.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.160]   I mean, that's why I like this little ad hoc tagging way.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   I like the idea.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.640]   We talked about a whole bunch of different ideas for getting listeners to Mac break more
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.400]   involved in the stories that we're going to do before and after the show.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.320]   But for now, I think this is a good first step.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.400]   It makes it easier for people to hop in and say, "Hey, go check this out."
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.880]   And we absolutely see them all.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   We do, guys agree?
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:16.400]   And if you want to see the tags that people are saying us, you can just go to delicious
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   /tag/mewid.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   So that's what your point is, is that it is in fact open to anybody who wants to see.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.800]   And you can see, so you get a good idea of the stuff that I'm nicking off a dig to talk
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.520]   about for the next episode.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.280]   That's pretty much what we get.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   But I do credit.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   Well, that's good.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.960]   It was on dig, I guess.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:42.720]   It was a tech, I think it was a tech crunch post about the new site, about how big delicious
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   it got.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   Yeah, I think it's your right.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:51.240]   It was 900,000 new subscribers in the five months since Yahoo bought them, something like
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   that.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   Yeah, I think they just broke 1 million.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.120]   I'd love to see the curve, though, on the number of people, number of posts versus how
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.480]   many times that person has posted and so on.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.360]   I bet that's a, I'm not going to use that word, I've already used it for the month.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.080]   But I bet it's way past 80/20 in terms of the number of people.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.880]   I think about dig or delicious.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.480]   I was thinking of delicious.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.680]   Just to see the curve of the number of total entries from the total number of users.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.040]   Because I bet there's a pretty small group that's getting you in.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   That does most of it.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.320]   And outsides and out of the actual.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.120]   I think delicious is not as easy to use.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.080]   It's not as transparent.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   It's a little opaque.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.240]   Once, like a lot of the things that you tell me about Merlin, until you tell me about
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.320]   him, I know about him, but I don't get how useful they are.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   And then you have a knack.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.160]   And that's one of the things I like about your blog, about 43 folders, is you have a
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.040]   knack of saying, "Oh no, we'll see what you can do with this."
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.200]   And sewing it into.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.520]   You're the king of spackle.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   You sew it.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.160]   I would love to become the king of spackle.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.080]   That would finally get me a little bit of lumber over in Cupertino.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.680]   You know, another nice thing that just toss us out real quick, something that I started
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.840]   using, is something called Only Wired.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   Onlywire.com, one word.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.200]   I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it lets you set up if you have multiple
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.840]   bookmarking services, like say you like to use Magnolia as well as Delicious, any of
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.280]   the other popular bookmarking sites.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.160]   You basically enter all your login data for all of those and you get one bookmarklet to
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   rule them all.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.360]   So, just something to know about if you're in one place.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.360]   I need that.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.200]   I need to be able to do that to multiple delicious.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.840]   Well, do you want to hear the hack for that?
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   Yes.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.160]   Here's the hack for that.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.040]   Set that up with, so let's say you've got Alex one account.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:32.560]   Set up your Alex one account using Onlywire and then log out of Delicious and set up your
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   Alex two account using regular Delicious because it's the API that handles the Delicious
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.840]   login for Onlywire and therefore you basically have access into two different bookmarklets.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.720]   So you'd have two bookmarklets and both of them would be both of them.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.120]   That's how I do my own man stuff versus my forty-three.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.560]   That's my big problem with Delicious.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   I would like to have multiple accounts with Delicious.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.760]   That's why I do this problem too.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   I had to move my stuff over.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.800]   I mean, because I'm actually, this is something that they're supposedly working on is the
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.840]   ability to pull out by, this is so not about Max, but the ability to pull out.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.400]   So my problem was I didn't have an easy way to present the links on my site for just
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.960]   one tag, which in my case was forty-three folders.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   And I think that's something they're working on.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.600]   We can get a little bit more granularity.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.520]   Wouldn't it be great to be able to say, "Show me everything that's Leo Laport plus Mac
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.080]   Break out of a feed?"
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.960]   So I think that's not working on.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.040]   You can't do it.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.080]   You can't pull it into, to my knowledge, you cannot pull that into a daily post easily.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.200]   I've wangled it using Feedburner and a little bit of Spitt and Bailing Wire, but I don't
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.280]   think it's an official canonical trick.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.320]   I have a request.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.820]   Yes.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.840]   I want to know if there's any of these sites that will allow me to put in all my grocery
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.560]   store numbers so that when I go, I can just give one.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.240]   One number and still get my checkout stuff.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   Kind of.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.760]   There's a site you can go to that will let you create one.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.240]   Why are you less than set up?
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.640]   There's a site you can go to.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.040]   I think I got the self of Life Hacker or maybe Boing Boing, but you can go in and enter in
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.720]   or scan, I guess, all the barcodes for all of your grocery stores and generate one code
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.600]   that you can put on a card to take it with you everywhere.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   And then just...
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   I do eat have the answer, Leo.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   That makes sense.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.560]   You just have one card with all these little stripes on it and you say, "Scan the third
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   one down, please."
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to a tattoo parlor and have that put
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   on my forehead.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.560]   That is hot.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.720]   I just get a chip.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.560]   Mine is mostly Safeway.com.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.320]   How long before Safeway gives you a little implant in your arm?
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.440]   So you just walk right through the store, right?
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.360]   I got an RS-232 port in the back of my neck.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.360]   Ah.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.320]   I know a lot of people who like to swap their Safeway cards with each other every month
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   or two, they'll swap Safeway cards.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.880]   Oh, they're card swappers.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.200]   You still get the discount, but you kind of...
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   All of a sudden he's buying so many diapers.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.720]   The diapers and whiskey.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.720]   This is confusing.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.640]   Now, I love that kind of stuff because that's really what do they call it?
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   Monkey Wrenching.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   Culture jamming.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   Culture jamming.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.000]   It's just a great idea.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.960]   Should we talk about the fact that the...
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.200]   Well, see, I hate to...
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:00.360]   One of the pitfalls of a show like this is you end up doing a lot of rumor stuff.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.440]   And most of this stuff, as we know, having covered this for so long is bogus.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.600]   So here's another rumor, Apple planning to update the MacBook and Mac Pro lines in time
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.160]   for the holiday shopping season.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.520]   This is according to Apple Insider.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:20.000]   Core 2 Duo in the 13-inch MacBook, the 15-inch Pro, and the 17-inch MacBook.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.240]   I guess that's the only thing you could do.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.400]   And Leo, we're going to figure out if this is true based on your purchasing decisions.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.520]   Yeah, I bought a MacBook, so it's probably true.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.520]   I'm screwed.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.680]   And if you bought one, then I'm putting in my order for the new one.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   You know what?
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.000]   I'm loving my Mac Pro.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Yeah?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Oh.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Oh.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.200]   So aren't you glad I told you to get one?
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   Beautiful.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   I'll tell you one thing, beautiful design.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.680]   Go to the Apple Store and just open it up.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.440]   You know, it's got the same latch as the old G5 case.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.360]   It's pretty much the same case until you open it up and look inside.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.760]   There's all this room, first of all, because you don't need so much cooling.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.000]   And then, you know, there's four or five, I think five drive bays.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.560]   I added a drive today.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.800]   You don't need a cable.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   You don't need screws.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   You don't need anything.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.120]   I got a bear drive.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:13.080]   You flip the latch, the same latch that opens the hatch also unlocks these slide out drawers.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.400]   The first drawer is the drive I came with.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.720]   I slid that out.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.240]   I got a Western digital Raptor because I'm a fan of these 10,000 RPM drives.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   Slid the Raptor.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.920]   You know, it has a bracket thumb screws.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.280]   You screw the Raptor drive in.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.440]   You don't need a cable because when you slide it in, it connects with the SATA cable and
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   the power cable.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.760]   Just boom like that.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.120]   So the other one over, it was the easiest drive upgrade I've ever made.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.440]   I mean, just mind blowing.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.040]   And the machine is very, very fast.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   Beautiful, beautiful machine.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.000]   Did you get the 1900 card, Leo?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   I did.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   And how much noise does the card itself make?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.960]   Well, it's got big old fan and big old heatsink, but you know, it's much quieter than the
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   dual G5.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.840]   I mean, that was a very noisy machine.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.400]   This runs much cooler and much quieter.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.200]   Well, you know where I'm going with this?
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.600]   You want to put it in your studio.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.120]   Is that something that would be doable?
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   I think so.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.560]   You know, it's running right now.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   You don't hear it.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.360]   I have to admit, I'm just about to invest in one of those ice-waters for a box to put
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.360]   it in.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   And they make them somewhere actually not too far away from here.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.480]   I use, you know, these high old mics I use are pretty directional.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.280]   I get more noise from the fact that it's a worn day in Petaluma and I've got the windows
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   open.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.760]   You probably hear cars going by and trucks going by.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   Then you hear the machine.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.920]   The machine's quiet.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:30.720]   And let me tell you, World of Warcraft on a 30-inch monitor...
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   It's awesome.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:37.600]   In fact, frankly, I haven't been paying attention to a word you guys have been saying.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.920]   And then I put doom on here.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.600]   You turn everything up all the way.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.880]   Finally, I've never been able to do that on a Mac.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:50.040]   Andy Ailey is saying everything all the way up and the thing is 1,600 by 1,200 just gorgeous.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   Just gorgeous.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.640]   World of Warcraft actually runs at the native resolution of the monitor, which is kind of
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.160]   an outrageous resolution.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.160]   It's very realistic.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.360]   I feel like it's my new home.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.360]   I am an undead priest.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.400]   Do not mess with me.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   What level?
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   What level?
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   Oh, I'm only a level 19.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   I'm such a wimp.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   You should hire someone in India.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   They'll bring it right.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   I know.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   I need somebody to level me up.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.840]   Who's going to level me up?
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.680]   But then you get there, you're level 60 and you didn't go through all the trouble and
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.400]   trial and work to get there.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.360]   It's kind of like hitting Nirvana without going through all the lives.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   You're just not rooting for it.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.600]   It's like rolling your characters and then starting out at the 9th level, dude.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   Can't do it.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   It's cheating.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   Can't do it.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.360]   Yeah, but I've gotten to level 67 in Pac-Man.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   So there.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.600]   You know, at level 40 you get a steed.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.360]   That's another game.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.360]   Anything else?
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.520]   You know what we did last week and I thought it was really fun.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.960]   I didn't warn you ahead of time, Alex, we were going to do it, but we asked everybody
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.320]   for a tip or a program they're using or something they like a lot.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:00.080]   I've kind of just done mine, which is my new love of my life, which is the Mac Pro.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.280]   Who wants to start us off?
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.920]   Any recommendations?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   I got mine.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   What's that, Scott?
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.080]   I'm going to stick with iTunes again this week.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.640]   I gave a tip last week for the new iTunes and I'm going to give another one that I once
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.880]   again stumbled on and it's intuitive.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.720]   It's something you would probably expect, but I just found it by accident.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   I think it's really cool.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:25.040]   You can use the scroll wheel on your Mighty Mouse or for that matter any other mouse to
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.840]   page through your album art in CoverFlow.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.160]   You have to go in and adjust your scroll speed if you want to be able to slow it down to
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.920]   one album at a time.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:39.240]   But what was really cool is one of my buddies got a vertical mouse.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.480]   It has a vertical scroll wheel and even though CoverFlow is a horizontal experience, the
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:48.280]   vertical mouse works and you can scroll through all your stuff really cool.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:54.520]   While you're playing Warcraft, Leo, I'm spending hour upon hour just gazing at my CoverFlow
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.280]   thing as it whizzes by me.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.000]   It's unclear who's actually wasting more time at this point.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.120]   Yeah, but it's very cool.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.840]   You can use your little Mighty Mouse and I got the new wireless one, which works very
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   well.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:05.840]   I can just scroll through.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.920]   So just try your scroll wheel to look at your CoverFlow art.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.400]   I like it and I do, I have to say, cover flow.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.640]   I hadn't used CoverFlow until iTunes 7 and it's a great application.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.520]   I did a nice job with any reading that.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.920]   Merlin, what are you using and doing and liking these days?
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.760]   Well, I used to be embarrassed to talk about this, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.160]   I love an application called Pizziz.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.160]   I'm embarrassed to hear it.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.880]   Yeah, I was hearing you say it, embarrasses me.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.520]   You guys can be very unconscious.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.520]   Pizziz.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.520]   Pizziz.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.520]   Pizziz.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.520]   Pizziz.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.600]   I need an old priest.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.920]   Talk more about Pizziz.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.480]   Pizziz, I've talked about this on the site.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:52.040]   It's a terrific little application that does the seemingly dork task of helping you take
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.600]   a nap.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.280]   It lets you, so if you're like me and you go, you know what?
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   Let me just spell Pizziz.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   P-Z-I-Z-Z.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.440]   Let me finish the thought because here's the problem.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.360]   If you're liking me and you lay down, all of a sudden you wake up, all things considered
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.080]   is on and you haven't done any work all day.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.560]   So Pizziz is this terrific program.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.520]   It costs, but what you do is you get this great little program and you say, okay, I want
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.840]   to take a nap of this length.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.200]   I want the little helpful new age voice to be this loud and I want the little music to
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.920]   be this loud and it generates a custom nap of the amount, exactly the amount of time
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:22.920]   that you want.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   I mean, 20 minutes.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.280]   You're saying you use software to generate custom naps?
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.960]   Okay, now here's, now, you might want to go ahead and put in an order for crow because
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.120]   I know how you enjoy that.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.840]   I have a deep fry tonight.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.040]   Tonight, when we get off, I'm going to send you a 20 minute nap.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.040]   Pizziz.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   You can send people naps?
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.880]   That's why I need to finish the thought.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.880]   Sorry.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.560]   You, you, no, it's totally dorky until you try it and then you go, you know what, a 20
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.320]   minute nap completely changes my day.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.400]   And so what this does is it walks you through this very simple, like, you know, you just,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   you go to sleep, you're like, oh, this is so stupid.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.600]   I'm never going to fall asleep.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.760]   You're totally asleep.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.720]   And then it gently wakes you up.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.560]   And then if you can, just in case you miss it, there's an incredibly annoying buzzer at
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   the end.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.440]   But it's, there's, I think there's some growing research from what I can gather about
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.880]   the benefits of taking a nap in the middle of the day.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.200]   And if you don't want to risk, you know, losing your job because you're, you know, asleep
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.960]   for four hours, this is a great way to take a real, from 10 minutes to 60 minutes.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   You can take this really blitz of a nap and they have a free demo you can try.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.280]   I'm confused about the pricing.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.320]   So the Pizziz software and the energizer plug-in is 40 bucks.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:32.120]   Do you need to then spend 20 bucks on a sleep plug-in?
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.600]   See, this is why they should hire like, I don't know, adaptive path or somebody to explain
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   this.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   The, the energizer plug-in lets you take what's called an energizer nap.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.960]   I can't believe I'm talking about this.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.400]   It sounds dorky, but it's not into the energizer.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.480]   If that's an energizer nap, that's where you grab it.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.320]   The energizer is a kind of nap.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   That's right.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.440]   The sleep module is to like help you get to sleep at night.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.360]   So if you're in a hotel, help you.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.280]   And what happens when it's Pizzizzing?
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.640]   When it's Pizzizzing, it goes through a series of, and I think it's incorporating, I don't
[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.840]   know all the scientific details.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.080]   It's on your iPod, we should mention.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   So it can be.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   It starts out, here's the cool part.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.400]   It starts out as an application on your Mac.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.080]   Then you can generate as an AC or as an MP3 any of the naps that you've generated and
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.400]   put them on your iPod.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.840]   And everyone is different.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.680]   So each one you generate has slight differences to it.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.200]   So yeah, anyway, I'd recommend just before you completely scoff and I do understand,
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.000]   like everything on 43 folders, I understand the scoffing.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.680]   But have a look and, and try it.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.760]   And I'll send you a demo nap tonight.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   And you're-
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   Hey Leo, I'm going to send you a link to RadioShack's website where for $2 you can buy an alarm
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   clock.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.360]   Somebody sent me a Buddhist alarm.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.560]   No, somebody sent me a Buddhist meditation thing.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   Aren't those awesome?
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.160]   Is it the one with old dong?
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.520]   Yeah, it's like a little box.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.520]   It has its own speaker.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.240]   You could plug it into a speaker system.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.200]   And it's got, it was all in Chinese.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.360]   I don't know what it does except that you flip switches and all of a sudden it makes
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.040]   sounds and you get very meditative and relaxed.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.280]   So this must be like a hard one.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.320]   But it doesn't do a meditative like a wake up.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   I don't know.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.840]   I haven't gone through the whole process.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.240]   I just have this box.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   I don't know where it came from.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   Nobody labeled it or anything.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.720]   It just arrived on my doorstep.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.200]   They have these alarm clocks that will do typically when you come out of it.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.000]   It looks like it's just like a green thing with a speaker.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.480]   There's no, there's no readout or anything.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   No, I mean-
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   This sounds kind of scary though.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   I mean, you've got to find my way that came from.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.320]   There was no return address.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.760]   You might have become some kind of a zombie killer and not know.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.280]   But you're giving your ex-septant speech Friday night.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   Don't be surprised if you hear that your mouth say, "Scott born, come up and accept this."
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.400]   I would be nothing if it weren't for Scott Born.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.280]   We're all net radio.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   Thank you.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.320]   My little minions have sent these little green modules to people all over the world.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.800]   I'm sorry I came from.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.720]   So anyway, it's PZIZ.com and your mileage may vary, but it's worth looking out.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.280]   Dateline IP Clinic Marin County, California.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.240]   Researchers announced today the results of a 25-year study on the effects of napping in
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.760]   industrial and post-industrial nations.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.280]   The study's outcome was clear.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   For 92.5% of workers, an afternoon nap increases their productivity, their creativity and their
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.760]   problem-solving skill.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   That's right.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.680]   There are these people who enjoy more of them, their grand vitality every day with NACS.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.480]   You guys realize they probably are going to take this and turn it into a spot.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.720]   NACS states an afternoon nap increases productivity by 35% and decision-making ability by up to
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   50%.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.360]   The scientist says, "I was sleepy and then I wasn't."
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.400]   "I make up and I feel better.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400]   I am awake."
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.760]   "Now here's Guy in a bottle."
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   Okay.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.560]   That actually is from the PZIZ website.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   PZIZ.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.480]   So you know it's true.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.400]   PZIZ is a personal life.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   You guys laugh.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   Coaching.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   You guys have all the fun you want.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.280]   You're little small world collapsing on itself, but just try it.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.200]   I have to say, I really want one that does a Zen wake-up, which is like if you're doing
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   Zen meditation-
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.200]   Yeah, the bomb.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   You get the-
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.000]   You guys go up by not waking you up?
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   No, no, no.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.440]   What it does is it's not just that it bongs.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.920]   It slowly pulls you out of it.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.320]   So what will happen is that when you're coming out of meditation, if you're not careful,
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.040]   if you don't have an alarm clock and you're good at it, you can stay in it.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.880]   You think you'll be there for 45 minutes and you're there for four hours and you can't
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   move your legs and you can't-
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.800]   Can we say "bong" on this radio too?
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.440]   There's a meditation timer.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.080]   I'll check it out on that guy's plate right now.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   I'm pretty sure there's a software meditation timer.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.640]   Because what it'll do is it'll go "dong" seven minutes before you finish and then it'll
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.360]   do it- it'll cut the time in half and three and a half minutes and then cut it in half
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.520]   and cut it in half and cut it in half.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.880]   So what you end up with is this kind of this "dong" and then right at the very end it's
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.600]   like "dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong."
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.440]   And that's how the- I mean, if you're at a Zen- we have lots of Zen centers here in
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.600]   San Francisco, so it's easy to find.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:54.440]   But that's what it would- it's a re-creation of that, which would be kind of cool.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   Wow.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.040]   I'm interested to see if it's there.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040]   Go- hit-neck update for a meditation timer.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.600]   It's a version of- I was going to build one with water.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.960]   So I was like a weekend project for me.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.400]   Like, you know, you fill it up with a certain amount of water and it makes all these little
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.400]   things turn around and hits the little thing just in time.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   Wow.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   Wow.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400]   I see.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   Anyway.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]   Wow, this shows you-
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.800]   I had my- I had my cool thing.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   Yes.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   Okay, so-
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   So I got two covers-
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   So I got two covers-
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   Up-
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   Ziz-
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   And now Alex.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   Yes.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   I got two, but they're short.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   Yes.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.520]   Okay, so the first one is the one that I really like is PodTube.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:38.720]   So you know, you see something funny on YouTube and you want to put it on your iPod.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   Yes.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.200]   Which- and all you have to do is you have to have Safari.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.960]   It doesn't work with Firefox, but if it's open in the Safari window and you run PodTube,
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.640]   you just go get it and it literally downloads it from YouTube, converts it to, you know,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.080]   iPod, Mingle, Video, and throws it into iTunes.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.080]   What a-
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.080]   It's free.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   That's a fantastic-
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   It's free.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.080]   You know, I don't know if it's free or not.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   It's free.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   It's free.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   It hasn't happened to pay yet.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   I haven't paid for it, so you've-
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   Tubes not.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   Tubes not.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   Tubes not does that, but it's demo where I don't think it's free.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   Yeah, but-
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080]   I can use Tubesoc, it works well.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   Tubesoc is free.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.320]   Yeah, so both of those are great, you know, because you know, you don't want to go to
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.200]   the website every time, every single time you want to watch that stuff.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.600]   And then the other one that I've just gotten into and you guys have been the victims of
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   this show is WebStractor, which I'm-
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.360]   Oh, is that how you did this?
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   Does that work for a man?
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.320]   It runs on a Mac, and so what WebStractor does is you can just surf.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   So what happened-
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.920]   What I did is I actually-
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   In the careful preparations-
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.240]   In the careful preparations for the episode.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   I did.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.760]   So I hit Mac.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.320]   I just went to the delicious list.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.480]   Oh, and you just down-
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.480]   And I just-
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.800]   And I set it, I set my-
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.960]   You know, I just pushed everything into WebStractor.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.640]   So I literally went to Delicious from within WebStractor.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.920]   And then I just clicked on all of them really quickly and it loads them all up.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.480]   And then I say, "Okay, I want to edit them after I go out of browsing.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   I have them all-
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.120]   They're all those pages that I just looked at are all loaded into WebStractor.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.280]   And they say, "Okay, I want to edit them."
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   And what I did-
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.960]   People can't see this, but I cut out all the headers and all the ads and everything else,
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   just so we can look at it.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   You know, so I just eliminated everything that I need to.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960]   So if you're doing research, it's great because you don't have-
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.320]   You know, you can get rid of all the clutter.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.040]   Because you can actually edit the pages, and then export the whole list of pages.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   You can organize them.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.640]   There's like a cool table of contents at the beginning.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   I didn't do any of that stuff.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.800]   I just hit table of contents and it just made it for me.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.480]   And so anyway, I thought-
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:32.440]   It's one of those things that, you know, I've had sitting around for a while and I just
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.720]   started to really dig into and it's actually pretty nifty.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720]   I still don't know how to-
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.600]   Did you buy it?
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.680]   I bought one a long time ago and then I got them to send me another one.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.960]   You're stuttering, Alex.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   It's kind of-
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   It's kind of-
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.120]   No, just that it's a little pricey.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120]   How much is it?
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   Webstructure 1.6.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   It's 80 bucks.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.120]   Yeah, no, I paid 80 bucks once.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   Before.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   No, I bought a car in 1954 so I can use my neighbors any time I want.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.120]   I'm holding the license up to the mic now.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   No, they-
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   No, they-
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   I called them and they sent me one.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   You know, so-
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   But the-
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   But I did pay for it in a former life.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   And-
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   But the-
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   I didn't mean it that way.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   I just meant to change the price.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see how it is.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.120]   That's a lot to spend.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.120]   But Pizziz is only a 40 dollar-
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   No, they just cheap.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   But the thing is, is if you're doing a lot of research and we do a lot of that stuff here,
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   where you want to-
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.120]   You just clip all the stuff.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   It looks awesome.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   You want to have the website.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   You want to have the webpage, but what you don't want is all the other crap that goes around.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   Do you use Devin for that kind of thing, Merlin?
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.120]   Yeah, I do.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   I've-
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   You know, it's funny.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   I run kind of hot and cold with Devin thing, but I-
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   Conceptually, it's really-
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.120]   The bottom line is if it had tags, it would be like the best thing in the world for me.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120]   But as it is, it's still really useful.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   It's just-
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   You still kind of have-
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:08:00.120]   So for people who don't know, it's kind of similar to like the Joo Jimbo or any of those things where you kind of point it at information and it sucks it all into this big soup.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   And I'm not really doing its service here, but it's an easy way to take a huge amount of information, put it into this one unified system, and then be able to search against it.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120]   And it's not-
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.120]   It's not exactly the same as WebStractor because you don't get this document.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   Oh gosh, no, no.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.120]   But what it's-
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   The thing that it's good at, and I suspect most people probably don't use it to its full potential, is in finding semantic relationships between documents that you kind of weren't aware of.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   So it looks for keyword frequency and all kinds of, you know-
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.120]   It's pretty smart.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.120]   I mean, it's kind of a interesting program.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120]   It's really smart.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   Yeah, it's really great.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   I mean, it's again this-
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   It's the costly application show.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   But it's not free, but boy, it's pretty powerful, especially-
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   I learned-
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   I got excited about it a few years ago, and then I read a piece Stephen Johnson did on his blog about how he uses it to put his-
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   Books and articles together.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   And for somebody who does a lot of research, it's a, you know, you can basically come up with Quicksilver keys or services keys to send, you know, to just basically say send this current page, you know, to-
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   Devin, think, and it sucks everything down, including the images.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   So it's pretty cool.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   I have something you might be a little interested in as my little tip.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   I know you're an iMap user.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   You use Fastmail as do I.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   And there's a problem with iMap servers.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   Because Apple Mail doesn't handle idle properly.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.120]   And so actually Apple Mail doesn't update properly.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   A good iMap server will actually say, "Hey, I've got some new mail and push it to the client, to mail."
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120]   iMap idle.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.120]   Have you seen this?
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   It's a real-
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]   No, tell me more.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   It's a report.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   I don't know how many-
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   Oh, tell me more.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   I don't know how many-
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120]   Oh, tell me more.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   I don't know how many-
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   Oh, tell me more.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   I don't know how many-
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   Oh, tell me more.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   Apple Mail, it's very early days.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   Apparently, it just got it working.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   But it works great for me.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.120]   I put it in and no longer do I have to pull my iMap server.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   It actually pushes the new mail to me automatically.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   I love it.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   Yeah, simple little thing.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.120]   But a very kind of neat thing to have if you use Apple Mail and iMap server.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   And that is it.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120]   We are out of time.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   I have asked for a demo copy of Pizziz.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:13.120]   And with any luck, as this show winds down, do you think I can play a little bit of the Pizziz Nap?
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   Yeah, I think you should.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   Okay, now if you're driving-
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:22.120]   If you're driving, please keep your eyes open at this point.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   And do you want to send me a nap or should I-
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.120]   I think the Pizziz people would mind me sending you a 20 minute mp3.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.120]   I won't play the whole nap.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.120]   I mean, this is only-
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.120]   It's a short-
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.120]   We just play a few seconds.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.120]   I'll tell you what, this conversation will do the trick right now.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.120]   If you're not asleep yet.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.120]   If this ain't looking to sleep, we'll get you something that will.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   Okay, so send me a little nap, Merlin.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   If you have one that-
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   We can pretend like you're playing it right now.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   I am playing it right now.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   Well, there it is.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.120]   Through the magic of time shifting, this is Merlin's nap.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120]   He's actually-
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.120]   Merlin, it's time for all things considered.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.120]   Time to wake up, Merlin.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   Linda Wertheimer's calling.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Daniel Shore.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   All right, thank you everybody.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.120]   We'll see you next Tuesday on-
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   Oh, I should plug everybody.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   MerlinMan43Folders.com,
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   Scott Born at-
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   What a-
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   I-Life Zone and podcast, uh, at tricks.com.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.120]   Is it podcasting?
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   Tricks.com.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   One of these weeks you'll get it right, podcasting tricks.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   There's an in.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   You're full of beans.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   He's a bad.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120]   He's because of the Thurston Hall impression last week.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.120]   And, uh, of course, Pixel Core is where Alex Lindsay hails from.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   He's the master.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.120]   They're really behind this show, a Mac break.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.120]   Uh, and-and actually we're gonna-
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   Uh, you have a-
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120]   We're adding more shows.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   A couple of new shows in- what is inside the black box?
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   Yeah, we have actually two new shows that are gonna be coming up.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   And, uh, they've actually- we have a couple of the episodes out,
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   but we really just think that it really fits inside of what, uh,
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   with the Twit and stuff.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   And that is, um, the VFX Show, which is a discussion between, um,
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.120]   uh, me and some other, uh, guys that are pretty deep into visual effects.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120]   And we're just- we just look at movies.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120]   I love it.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   So we just- we just go watch a movie and then we talk about it.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.120]   It's kinda like, you know, it's kinda like, uh, any of these shows,
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   but just talking about them.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.120]   Just the visual effects we don't really care about whether the movie was actually good or not.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   Should people as homework watch the movie first and then listen to the show?
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   Um, yeah, yeah, 'cause we don't worry about spoiling it.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.120]   So, um, uh, so like this week we're gonna be talking about, uh, Flyboys,
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   which was a- had great effects and, you know, you should-
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   It flopped like instantly.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120]   I didn't even know it was already-
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   And it- it was bad.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.120]   So, um, but it was- but the effects were really cool.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120]   And, um, so that's what we'll talk about.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120]   And it's easier to talk about-
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120]   Yeah, the trailer was amazing for that show.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.120]   It was- it was one of the more beautiful, um, beautiful movies that I've seen before.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.120]   I thought it was good.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.120]   It disappeared.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.120]   It didn't last for, I mean, I- I was flappy.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.120]   I went- I went and saw it Saturday.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   It's great.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120]   Oh, I just always sat down.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120]   Oh, was it out now?
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120]   Sad.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   Yeah, I- I just think we'll go to one movie?
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   I- I agree.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120]   It's sappy.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   But I have to admit that I was mostly there because of the special effects.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.120]   And I gotta tell you, it's some of the best flight photography I have ever seen.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   Yeah, no, it was- it was really- it was really good in that- in that respect.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.120]   So is that one, uh, that one's not up yet?
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.120]   Um, that one's not up yet.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.120]   Uh, that one's not up yet.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120]   Uh, that one's not up yet.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.120]   Uh, by the end of tomorrow, actually.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.120]   I'm actually starting to record it in ten minutes.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   So, um, uh, and then, um, uh, and then the other show is called Inside the Black Box.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.120]   So this has actually been something we've been testing on and off for years.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   And this is really showing you how visual effects get done, but really aimed at a simpler version.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.120]   So we're really showing you kind of the basics of how Matt's get created and how we have actually
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.120]   one up there with, uh, one of the stunt guys from Pirates of the Caribbean talking about,
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   you know, how you beat yourself up, you know, without being actually touching you.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   So that's coming soon to- without being touched.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   That should be- yes.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.120]   I'm very good at beating myself up without being touched.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   Actually.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   So that's- that's something I really don't need, but I'll listen to it anyway.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   Anyway, it should be fun.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   Alright.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   Uh, ladies and gentlemen, please do not attempt to close your eyes if you're driving an automobile,
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   but if you are at home while you're preparing to rest deeply, you may begin your nap now.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   It's a good idea to ensure that you'll not be disturbed.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   This is not a joke.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120]   It's comfortable.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120]   [laughing]
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   Send mer- send Merlin a stone in.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.120]   [laughing]
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   Let go of that dollar bill that you'll get as much benefit as possible if you send us money.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   Is that guy really talking?
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.120]   [laughing]
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120]   You know some advice for just a little while.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.120]   Be the rock.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.120]   [laughing]
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120]   Let's just let yourself drift off.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120]   See you.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   Good night, everybody.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120]   Wax on, wax on.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.120]   [music playing]
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:53.120]   [music playing]
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.120]   [music playing]
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   Okay.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.120]   [music playing]
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   [laughing]
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   You guys are all dead.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   [music playing]
