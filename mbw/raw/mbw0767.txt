[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Alex Lindsay's back. Renee Richie, Andy Inaco,
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   Apple and Epic lay it all on the table. It was the last day yesterday of the
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.520]   Fortnite trial. We'll take a look, we'll look back, we'll analyze it, we'll make
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   some predictions about winners and losers. Then we're going to talk about Apple's
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.480]   new lossless audio and spatial audio, which is better. High res, no loss or
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.760]   surround sound in your ears, some strong opinions, plus all three of the guys have
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.400]   their brand new iPad Pro. We'll talk about the screen and the camera. How good are
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.880]   they? It's all coming up next with Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest Apple news. And we've
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.760]   got the full team back in studio. Alex Lindsey has returned although he wants
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.160]   to apologize for his desaturated lookup table. I'm sorry. You know, Alex, you
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.240]   had a is apparently boy, it's got to be hard at the Lindsay household. When
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.600]   somebody checks out the 6k black magic and you're forced to use the 12k black
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.240]   magic. And then there's a lot. It just goes all the way.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.000]   The 6k is normally what I use for my webcam. And then I was testing this 12k.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.120]   We're doing some tests with high frame rate 8k 120 frame per second. And so it
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.400]   was sitting in the and we needed one more camera for something else I was
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.840]   shooting last week. And so I took out the 6k and then I was like, but I still need a
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   webcam. So anyway, Logitech tells some pretty nice webcams or inexpensive.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.060]   Leo Leo. I just feel bad because I'm using a 10 year old Canon
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.160]   Vixia camcorder for my camera. So now thanks to Zoom, which you recommended,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.000]   and we have 1080p for all of our contributors. I have literally the worst
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.760]   pots. My frame rates worse than yours. It's ridiculous. Anyway, it's nice to have
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.520]   you back. Welcome back to Alex. Andy and I was also here in stunning 1080p.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.860]   Yeah, hand tuned. Don't don't feel bad. Just describe it as like you're using
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.060]   like the apology video like lighting. Like not the campaign video.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.100]   It does look like the one where you sat your to feel more like cozy. I would
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.220]   just like everybody to know that I regret my actions. And I was only looking
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.340]   out for the best for my community and for my constituents that I felt that the
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.600]   retirement funds of the Union, you can concrete business was just better placed
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.080]   in hiring people to put in a new pool at my third compound. I've learned from
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.440]   this mistake. Yes. And I'm not going to make that again. That's the apology
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.520]   lot. I think that's a good one. Keep that around. Yeah. You might be using.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.240]   No, you're never going to need that. Maybe me. Not you. Andy, it's great to have
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.800]   you and of course Renee Richie, who is probably in stunning 4k. I don't know
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.420]   how Renee. I'm not hanging an area off my computer like Alex Lindsey. I've just
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.140]   got 6k down sample to 4k down sample to 1080p and it's only in measly
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.060]   sea log to I'm not doing anything in raw like Lindsay is. That's right, Alex. You
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.500]   have you care about your video and we're giving you crap about it. We're your
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:25.700]   friends. I am just tell us. I have purchased a $100 1080p camera from from
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.800]   me Amazon. It'll be arriving tomorrow. Is it a low rent area? Did you just go
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.140]   low rent area? Very low rent. I thought it was an but it's actually an
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:43.440]   Al a loisius. I don't know. I don't like that. Micro. Actually, it's funny
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.580]   because I wasn't going to say anything but yesterday or Sunday on the on the
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.340]   radio show. I guess it was Saturday on the radio show. Dickey Bartolo was talking
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.500]   about how cam you know remember during the height of COVID at Logitech C920 was
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   going for you know hundreds of dollars over list. He says, Oh, now there are plenty
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.220]   of cameras. Look, here's a 1299 1080p HD webcam. Don't I look great? And I wasn't
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.940]   gonna say it didn't have a camera inside it but you didn't have the heart to tell
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.540]   them that it wasn't gonna say. You know, it's not bad. It's not I mean for 1299. It's
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:28.460]   not that it's amazing for it has a video image. It's a little soft at the edge is a
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.540]   little bit. It's a lot cheaper than actually like making 3D printing your own
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.740]   like camcorder prop for your cosplay. Yeah, so you know, yeah. And it and and on
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.660]   the bright side, it doesn't need a lot. But we're better with a lot. What you see
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.980]   is what you get. It doesn't it does need RS 2, RS 2 32. It does need it doesn't
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.820]   need a serial port. It's got the analog. It's got a video analog output. Aren't we
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.300]   happy that serial ports are gone and parallel ports are gone. And now we have
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.420]   the wonderful. It's because he now we have the one almost hype see which works sort
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.380]   of with no my gosh. You have to write you try to be crazy. Oh my God. I'm just like,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.660]   why is this connecting? Oh, right. It has to be a thunderbolt instead of a USB
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.980]   C and it's just. Oh, this has no delivery. Lisa has a Dell or has no data delivery.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:26.980]   The Dell 49 inch monitor that for five minutes, there was a standard called USB
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.500]   video, not thunderbolt. It won't work with a thunderbolt cable because it's got
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.420]   too much too smart. And so it is a Dell shipped it with this cable. But of
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.100]   course, it's too sure I give her my iMac Pro and it's too short. So we had to find
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   and you got to be careful a USB C. But it's a USB video cable. It's a weird cable.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.820]   And of course, they stop making it after five minutes because it's crazy.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.980]   Standard standards are the best for everybody. Everything completely opaque.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.020]   And I went through every cable in the house. I have hundreds of types of cables,
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.260]   none of which have USB video over USB. Anyway, let's talk about something much
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.540]   more interesting. The Apple versus Epic trial came to a close yesterday.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.620]   Well, close for now. Yeah, the judge says it's going to take me a long time, a long
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:32.780]   time to deliver my judgment. They had said August, but there's 4,500 pages of
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.540]   testimony alone, thousands of pages of court documents. Judge Gonzalez Rogers
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.420]   says she anticipates a ruling to take a considerable amount of time, but refuse
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.180]   to say any update. Am I wrong or were the lawyers and the
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.580]   Tims the worst? Like everyone else was fantastic, but the lawyers were terrible.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.460]   And both Tim CEOs just they sound as stupefied on the stand the entire time.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.260]   Well, I think Tim Cook took that what Alex, Alex, your dad was a prosecuting
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.100]   US attorney. So you know this, you never answer. You answer as little as possible.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.020]   Yeah, right. Yeah, absolutely. Everything. Everything is the answer is right.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.180]   Well, he probably did what he was counseled to do, which is say, I don't know. I don't
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.620]   remember. We don't we don't calculate those numbers. That kind of thing.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.460]   Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry. Can you read the question? I don't know.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.700]   I don't recall. Can you repeat the question?
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.340]   We only know how much money we make off the App Store when it's time to write a new
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.260]   developer keynote. After that, when they they they they they totally recall me
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.180]   into a machine. I totally have no idea. Yeah, he said he said we don't
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.020]   Tom said they sounded predatory when asked when asked how much of Apple's
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.380]   significant R&D budget is applied to the App Store. Tim Cook said we don't break
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.340]   it down like that. Well, and I think there would be a question. I could say
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.940]   that it would it would be impossible to break that down because it's the entire
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.100]   ecosystem. You're asking that you're asking them to calculate the cost of what
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.180]   it takes to build the entire thing because it's that's what it that's what
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.060]   the marketplace brings to them. Not what it takes to put a button on the App Store,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.900]   but what it takes to have a secure hardware environment that does all the
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.180]   things that that the Apple ecosystem does. I mean, that is the value of the of
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.300]   the marketplace. You could reasonably say everything we've put into the iPhone
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.540]   redounds to the App Store and its success. Well, and and and and all of
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.580]   Swift and and all of the and Xcode and you know, all of the all the development
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.940]   that goes into there is the entire ecosystem is the value that's brought to
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.500]   the developers. And so it's not it's not the App Store. That's absurd. You know,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.020]   and and so it's it is a it is the entire ecosystem that makes that work. It's
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.740]   like saying that what is the cost of of the of one of the stock, you know, one
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.460]   space inside of Westfield mall. It's not I mean, there's a lot of their
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.620]   security and there's parking and there's location and there's all the other
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.300]   things that they pay for or that they've invested in to make that one little
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.780]   space worth what it is. You know, and so I think that that's the that's the hard
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.620]   part is that you can't really unwrap that accurately. Well, when you're when
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.740]   you're under oath in front of a court, you can come up with a good estimation.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.500]   No, you shouldn't. How that's me. No, I'm I'm just saying that you could, but
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.380]   you should there should not. You understand what the your attorney is saying to you,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.300]   Andy, do not do that. But you should not.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.620]   All I'm saying is that this is I do absolutely understand that that argument.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.260]   But this there's another argument that this is sort of like Hollywood bookkeeping
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.380]   saying, how can you guess how much money the the Star Wars movie make you can't?
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:49.100]   It's just not possible, but it's it's true. It's not an untruth. What he's saying is not
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.060]   untrue in certain contexts. So it's you can't, you know, Epic's attorney can't say,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:00.220]   I object your honor. You can handle the truth. It's not it's not. You can't say he
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:06.020]   he's lying. I mean, I think it's that, you know, Epic Epic already lost the per the
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.540]   the PR campaign. They were trying to get forced Apple to do something without going
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.980]   to court. They've already lost that. So they so they have to win on the merits of
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.820]   an actual case. And so what Apple has to do is not do any unforced errors. You know,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.660]   Apple's already pretty far ahead. You know, it's a very good this judge. So Apple
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.180]   doesn't lose. And we should also point out they'll be at appeal, right? I mean,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.900]   this one another appeal and then it goes to Supreme Court and then unless the
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.140]   Supreme Court dramatically changes, the chance of succeeding is very low. So so it's,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.780]   you know, I mean, Epic's, you know, playing with a five or 10% chance of winning in
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.380]   the long run. And there's probably not going to be the requirements are so high.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.260]   For what Epic's asking the chances of any kind of regear. And there's not going to
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.900]   be any junction. I mean, they're going to ask for one most likely, but I don't think
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.020]   they're going to get an injunction to force Apple to do anything.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.100]   They asked for one at the beginning of the trial and the judge kind of said no,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.940]   you know, you know, and so, so I think that that's unlikely. Yeah, I think that
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.420]   it's going to be unlikely that until all everything has been spent until it's all
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.420]   the way accepted or not accepted by the Supreme Court, it'll just keep on going
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.340]   back and forth. And that's supreme, the current Supreme Court would be very
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.780]   unlikely to, to, you know, it may not be the current one. It may be completely
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.740]   different one in five years, which is about how long it's going to take to get
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.060]   there. Yeah. So like it's going to, you know, no one's in a rush.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.900]   What was Apple's not in a rush? So then the question was, what was Epic's
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.100]   goal in this knowing that it was, I mean, initially, I think they thought they
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.900]   would have a PR they thought that they would get the peasants to rise up against
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.260]   the overlord and the peasants really liked their iPhone. You know, like, and
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.980]   they were just kind of like, I, you know, what's, what's, you know, what's that?
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.740]   Talking horse from my Christmas. It's nothing. It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.660]   Fortnite. How do you spell Fortnite? You know, like, so, so, you know, like, so,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.940]   you know, that that's the problem is they thought that they were much bigger
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.740]   than they were among them. And then Apple cut their knees out from under them by
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.060]   giving 98% of the developers 15%. You know, and so, so there's not a lot of,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:00.020]   there's not a lot of heavy push that, that Epic has anymore and they, but, you
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.060]   know, you can't back away from it. Okay, forget it. We're not going to take it to
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.180]   court. So, and then, and you know, every time you go into a court case, you could
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.940]   win. Like it is, it is, it is everything's unpredictable. And, you know, you get
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.340]   someone in there and you could win the, the, the data is not in their favor, but,
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.020]   but every judge, especially a judge, every judge is going to have their own
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.860]   proclivities. But it has to get through a series of, of, you know, Apple may not
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.860]   even have an app store by the time it gets through all the appeals, like it
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.460]   may be completely different company by then. So, so it's, you know, it's not as
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.580]   it's a little anticlimactic in general. So, Renee, you referred to something
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:44.700]   Apple suggested that Epic was really a stalking horse for Microsoft. The
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.460]   Microsoft didn't want to file this suit. In fact, Microsoft's been very quiet
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   about the fact that they can't get X Cloud in the app store. But Apple
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.580]   believes that really it was Microsoft who was using Epic Games as a front.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:03.020]   You think that's credible? Yeah. I want X Cloud in the app store. I want
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.740]   Stadia. I want all those things. I think they're, they're non, there's no
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.340]   difference between them and having Netflix. It'd be, it'd be synonymous with
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.900]   not allowing Netflix on the app store back in the day and insisting every
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.060]   single movie they had be individually listed in iTunes. So, I think that's
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.540]   just Apple being myopic about the future and that's a little bit. I think
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:23.780]   it's, they said Microsoft avoided by, by meaningful discovery by not appearing
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:29.020]   as a party in it or sending a corporate representative to testify. And so,
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.460]   Apple was saying, you know, Microsoft is keeping this hands off approach to
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.260]   this. But honestly, they're, they have, they're just as much to lose. And I
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.500]   think actually, Alex, your point is well taken that what one of the outcomes
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.820]   of this is probably going to be a win for Apple. But one of the outcomes of
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:50.820]   this, and maybe this was Epic's long game, is that a lot of other companies may
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:57.100]   get the ammunition they need to put some pressure on it. I mean, Apple has
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.060]   to figure out, here's the problem is the marketplace is inefficient, is too
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.700]   inefficient at 30% for you to have a peer to peer exchange. So, you can,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.420]   someone puts something up that someone else buys. If that interaction loses
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.380]   30%, it becomes inefficient. And it's not, that's what, that's why Epic's
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.940]   fighting this. And that's why, you know, a lot of these companies want to build
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.500]   their own marketplace where people can buy and sell, not just, they're not,
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.340]   you know, if you're just selling, if you're just putting up an app, then
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.060]   you're paying Apple 30%, that's one thing. But it's when you want people to be
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.500]   able to put products on your, in your store and other people to buy those
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.660]   products. Now you want to build a marketplace inside the marketplace,
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.540]   you're basically double taxing the process. And that is the, that, that
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.580]   double taxes, the problem that Epic is trying to solve because they want that
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.820]   they, you know, that's a big piece of theirs. And the problem is they don't
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.620]   have another platform to use, you know, other than that, you know, other on the
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.860]   mobile platform, the mobile platform is a small percentage of their income,
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.140]   but they know where it's going to go. And they want to be, they want, they're
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.940]   trying to establish a way to control that or a way to lower that inefficient
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.260]   cost on, on their end.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.180]   This isn't a jury trial judge guns. All as Rogers has to be, is the deciding
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.460]   factor, at least at this stage in the trial. So everything is being delivered
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.500]   to her. Isn't it possible that she can cut through all of the BS? There was a
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.060]   lot of extra information. She's so smart. Yeah. And should, and should just
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:30.500]   judge the merits of the case on whether Apple puts Epic at a disadvantage or
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.180]   others, like Microsoft at a disadvantage by not allowing them in the app store.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.260]   And that maybe Epic should get some relief in that regard. But, but,
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.380]   actually, it's not that Apple won't say they can't be in there. They just want
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.100]   30% and Epic doesn't want to be it.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.060]   It was interesting what Alex mentioned is that the app store doesn't leave any
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.140]   room for two middlemen, like Apple, a lot of apps want to aggregate content and
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.380]   then sell it to you while they take a cut and Apple is aggregating apps and
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.940]   want to sell them to you while they take a cut. And there's no room for double
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.340]   aggregation because it's like 30% plus 30%. There's, there's not enough
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.420]   percentages in a hundred to make that work. And we saw that with Twitter this
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.860]   week where they announced their paid spaces and, you know, they get, they
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.460]   have to give Apple 30%. They have to give the host 30% or 50%. There's nothing
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.220]   left for Twitter in the end. And that's not tenable. And it seems like she is so
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.700]   smart and it seems like she did a better job. And a lot of people are saying
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.260]   that she did a better job cross examining Tim Cook and Tim Sweeney or Tim
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.380]   Cook, especially then Epic's lawyers were hugely disappointing this whole thing.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.380]   But the crux of what she got to, and I think what, what did set people on
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.300]   the edge is that Apple believes that they have a right to the money on the
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.860]   app store, not through like contributions by itself, but just through divine
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.060]   right. And one of the questions she asked was what if we remove like what if
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.140]   there was external payments and Tim Cook's answer wasn't, you know, like that
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.580]   would be different than them. It was like, well, it'd be harder for us to collect
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.940]   our 30%. And I think that part is resonating with her. And we, yeah, yeah,
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.660]   all right. See her say, well, you have to allow those payments.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.020]   Elizabeth Lopato writing in the Verge said this. She said throughout the trial,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.580]   Epic's general strategy appears to have been stuffed. The record is full of
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.020]   evidence as possible. Yeah. Just in case it's needed on the inevitable appeal.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.340]   And to do that, they sacrificed telling a coherent story. She says Apple, on the
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.060]   other hand, was very on point. It had a clear story. And it's spent the entire
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.380]   trial hammering at home, which is Apple controls the app store because the
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.380]   alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Do you think Judge
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:35.820]   Rogers, Gonzales Rogers, bought that Renee, that it's a security and privacy
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.860]   nightmare? I don't buy that.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.780]   I think she's savvy enough to understand that it has tremendous consumer benefit.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.940]   And one of the things that gave me that indication is when she made a remark,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.180]   and I'm going to forget the exact wording along the lines of, you can't change a
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.060]   thing and keep it the same, that there is a, the conditions around the app store
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.500]   may or probably contribute towards the success of the app store. And if you
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.820]   change those things, it may not be that successful for everybody. But I think
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.700]   she was nuanced. And what I like about her questions beyond there just being
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.060]   smart is they are nuanced. It's not black and white to her. It's not, it has to be
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.900]   this way, or it has to be completely open. And that's why I think she sounded
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.020]   like she was gravitating towards doing something like, just let them pop up a
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.700]   web view, which I think would make so much of this kind of stuff.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.020]   That's why it was heard Apple's profit prevents that, you know, famously, you
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.780]   know, you can't buy apps in the Kindle. You can't even mention that for games
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.220]   too, because it's so much money. It's so much even mentioned that money.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.140]   You can't even mention it. You can't say you could buy the cheaper, you get your
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.540]   Spotify cheaper online. You can't even say that. I think you're right, though. She
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.460]   did. She was smart. She got Tim Cook to vary a little bit from the company, the
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.420]   party line that it was about privacy and security and admit, well, it's kind of
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.380]   about profits.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.500]   Really savvy take on it, where he said that, you know, it almost sounded like
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.020]   casino people arguing with the government over how much of their ridiculous
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.500]   casino profits they have to tie it to the government. And I think she also saw
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.460]   that these are like V bucks. V bucks is zero marginal cost. They make billions
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.100]   of dollars on them. Apple wants a piece of that billions of dollars of
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.700]   in like, like non valuable V bucks that all these kids, I think there's a
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.580]   whole thing about kids, you know, making it easier for kids to transact,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   which Tim Sweeney is the super happy about. She's seen borderline appalled by
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.980]   and I think that's the part where it starts to get where she starts to show
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.500]   what she's going to do. Do you think Andy that she sees through the greed on both
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:34.460]   parties? And is there a clear way forward for her to kind of do the judicious,
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.620]   the Solomon like thing and say, well, we're going to find a middle ground?
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.100]   Yeah, Renee is absolutely right. She's very, very sharp. She understands these
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.340]   issues. She's also doing good work of a judge in that she understands the law,
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.700]   but also understands common sense and the intention of law. I think that the
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.660]   path that she has forward is to not do something as dramatic as saying,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.420]   guess what you can. Apple, you now have to allow third party app stores on your
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.540]   devices. But as simple as guess what? You've made very, very good very good
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.140]   arguments about why you have one solitary app store, you have not made good
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.820]   arguments about why you have policies where you are not allowed to, as you say,
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.420]   open up a open up a web view for for for third party purchases, or you're not
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.140]   allowed to say you're not allowed as a developer say, oh, by the way, we if you
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.500]   go to our website directly, you can save so much money as opposed to having to
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.180]   give will get will give apples cut to you or most of apples cut to you as opposed
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.380]   to giving it to apple. All these things are things that apple absolutely can do
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:43.220]   does not undercut any of their arguments about integrity or security. They only
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.740]   undercuts apples preposition that every opportunity that they have to collect
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.780]   the money off of the app store is something that's absolutely necessary for
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.100]   the app store survival, which is not something that in any of their testimony
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.580]   they ever defended not with numbers only with the only with the idea that
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.500]   I think the problem is the chaos that will occur with the developers if for
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.980]   the user if if you say that developers on to pay 30% if they go to the web
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.820]   page, then what all the developers will do is that you know, and then users
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.340]   don't have to deal with us, you know, like and then in the users have to go out
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.500]   we have to go out to the stupid web page. I mean, half the reason I don't buy
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   certain books is just because I'm like, it's a good point. It's a lot easier for
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   us to just use apple pay and you know, it's just automatic. And so the thing
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.020]   is is that it'll it'll create chaos for the user, you know, it'll it'll really
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.420]   stink, you know, to do well, will that be will it be more chaos than force of
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.660]   them to leave the app and go to another app in order to buy a damn comic book?
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.340]   Probably not. I don't know the thing they could do. They could simply say that
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.620]   you have no you you you can't justify apple can't justify that the purchase
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.500]   of a comic book is something that they helped to enable by virtue of the fact
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.700]   that of allowing that comic book with the arm content to be read on that
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.900]   device. That's again, another one of those arguments that very hard for apple
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.820]   to really defend and I have not read all the testimony, God forbid. But it's not
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.780]   something that I think that they address during during their testimony.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.300]   Yeah, I just I when I extrapolated, I just go, well, you know, the my experience
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.220]   as a user would be varied graded if every every time I mean, I at this
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:24.820]   point, almost not. I mean, the one exception is audible. So but outside of
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.780]   that, I will not buy anything that requires me to go out of the out of the
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.100]   app store. And I won't even buy anything on app on the apple TV that requires
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.900]   me to go out of my thing.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.700]   I think for the few apps where you do that, the Kindle app, audible
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.580]   app, it's okay. We we we we we we know, oh, yeah, I have to buy this
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.660]   on all of them. I actually don't anymore, but you don't even for a while.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.260]   You had a long time problem, by the way, is that Amazon's getting some sort of
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.780]   special treatment. But let's say you did it was I would that was tenable, but
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.500]   you make a good point if every app did that maybe that's not so tenable.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.620]   Well, and the problem is that the solution.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.860]   The solution is for apple to start doing what they're doing with games.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.220]   You know, like to just start buying things up, right? You know, like that.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.260]   And that's the original problem.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.820]   Developer thing Jeff Bezos, I'm really excited about the Apple Apple's doing
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.900]   that because the the experience for consumers of free to play games where
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.780]   there's all these in at purchases is crap and Apple knows it and does and and
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.500]   that was something Apple created.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:30.020]   You know, in its app store, but not offering demos, but you know, in effect,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.580]   Apple created this free to play problem and they're trying to solve it with
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.060]   arcade. Go ahead, Renee. I was going to say, yeah, the original.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.260]   So they had to try to navigate all this when the app store was first starting
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.060]   and especially when they started introducing more like originally, like
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.340]   free apps had to stay free. That was the basic rule.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.140]   And they were very careful about paid apps because they were basically taking
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.660]   on all the costs for free apps.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.620]   And then they changed the policy to allow in app purchases for free apps.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.020]   But then you had to do the in app purchases through Apple.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.220]   And my understanding is one of their big concerns was if they ever just made
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.780]   it a free for all, everybody would take all value out of the app store.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.980]   Like everybody would just move to web transactions.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.660]   There'd be no money flowing through the app store anymore.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.420]   And they still, I don't want to say burden because that's the wrong word for it,
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.860]   but they still be paying for everything, which is a non trivial amount of money.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.780]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.460]   They're making record.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.660]   On the Mac, we have that option and still many people and myself included
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.980]   prefer to buy stuff in the app store because it's just simpler and we get the
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.860]   updates and stuff.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.180]   Yeah, it's a more mature market now too.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.980]   But that was that was like they were operating off a fear response that they
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.860]   were going to just basically lose everything.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.220]   Like their mentality was if we if we let kids eat free, because we're going to
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.020]   make all the money off the parents and then the parents start insisting on
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.020]   cooking for themselves.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.860]   Now we're paying for all their kids.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.300]   And it's not a rational thing.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.620]   It's just like some of all fears.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.820]   And I think that I think it would be easier.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.540]   I personally think it would be easier for Apple to say, we'll let you, you can
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.380]   build another marketplace within our ecosystem, but you can't use our security.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.340]   You can't use, we're not going to pay for the bandwidth.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.420]   You get to pay for that too.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.940]   You know, like, like, so that's kind of what's the Mac OS is.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.020]   That's really what's going on in Mac OS is if you if you want, you still have to
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.060]   get through the security, but if you want, you can have your own store, but it's
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.300]   all on you at this point.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.980]   And I think a lot of users opt for the Mac App Store for that reason.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.820]   I won't buy anything under 50 bucks on outside of the Mac store because I just
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.980]   I don't have to install it again.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.260]   You know, it's, you know, it's pain.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.460]   I have to, I have to say that I do agree with, I think Craig Frederiga put it
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.980]   really, really well in his testimony about the big zappy headline was,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.580]   Craig Frederiga admits that there's a malware problem on the Mac store.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.820]   When actually the comment that he was making was that we have a platform in
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.900]   which if you do, I think the, I think the algorithm made is that this is, this is
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.220]   the Mac is an off-road vehicle.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.980]   If you want to go off the highway and start bouncing off of, off of
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.180]   ruts and trees, you're perfectly free to do that.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.860]   Whereas the, whereas iOS is designed to run on more consumer type devices.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.460]   I, I do think that it's a benefit to the consumers.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.740]   That's not an unreasonable defense from Apple to say that we don't want to have,
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.060]   we don't want to allow outside app stores.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.260]   We don't even want to allow a sideload of apps because it would be a bad
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.540]   experience for the consumer.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.820]   And I do think that's a, that's a verifiable argument.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.180]   What, what I'm very much in favor of though is for Apple to loosen the handcuffs
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:16.820]   on again, apps like, like, like the Kindle app, like the Comixology app,
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:22.260]   like any other app where I just, just the virtue of having to fork over so much
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.100]   money just to get the latest Usagi Ojimbo comic means that it's much more,
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.900]   it's much more attractive to make me go to another website in order to do that.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:37.860]   Same thing for, for annual subscriptions to, I, I'm very, very happy to pay for
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.660]   my annual subscription to Ulysses.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.700]   I would be happier if they got to keep more of that $40.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.620]   And if I, I think that if
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.940]   the argument to the, they just price it 30% higher so they get the amount of money
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.380]   they want Apple gets it's cut and the people who are really paying for it are the users.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.980]   See, that's, that's the other problem that do you want, do you want them to suffer
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.860]   because of a bad usage model or do you want them to suffer by increased prices?
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.380]   And then that, I think that's part of, to, to, to, to Alex's point earlier,
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.900]   I think that's part of what, what, what, what Epic was sort of counting on that.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.620]   Look, if you want to pay 30% more for all of your, for all of your content,
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.980]   don't blame us, blame Apple.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.180]   And as I said, that was not, that didn't really, that didn't win the hearts
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.900]   and minds argument.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.820]   Well, and I think that, I think that the, the issue is it's all relative to,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.140]   I mean, the reason that we're paying as little as we pay for these apps is because
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.780]   we're no longer subsidizing piracy.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.740]   You know, when, when you build software outside of this, I mean, when I was building
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:39.380]   software, you know, we were calculating somewhere between one copy we sold was
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.740]   something between one 10th and 100th of what was actually being used.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.860]   You know, and so you have to charge a certain amount to make up for that because
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.180]   you're trying to become sustainable.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.540]   And so we're buying incredibly powerful apps for $5 or $10.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.100]   And we're complaining that we're paying 30%.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.540]   But it's the secure architecture that Apple has created and, you know, in a known
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.980]   way that's easy for the user as well as easy for the developer.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.260]   And yeah, there's a 30% cost on top of that.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.860]   You know, and that's, that's the cost of thinking.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.020]   It's a 90% cost you were suffering.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.580]   Actually, I have to say that's a really good point.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.420]   Is it developer?
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.500]   Is it the case?
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.740]   You don't have to worry about piracy?
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.340]   I guess it's all.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.780]   It's, it's all just, it's all.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.260]   I mean, you have families sharing it or whatever.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.980]   And there's that type of thing, but it's so much.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.780]   Turn that off.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.620]   I think you don't have that.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.540]   And it, yeah.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.940]   And it's so much simpler than it used to be.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.140]   I mean, and I think that part of the reason I'm a little, you know, I get a
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.940]   little tweaky about this one specifically is because I lived in the age that I had
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.380]   to sell all the stuff and I had people, you know, pirating my software.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.060]   I go to pirate stuff and see my stuff everywhere.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.780]   And, and then I had to pay, you know, horrible percentages.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.260]   And it was, it was a bad experience.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.300]   And then you have to figure out how to do the updates.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.420]   And then you have to figure out how to get back to the, you know, there's so
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.020]   many things that we have to do before.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.100]   It's interesting that Apple focused on the users experience, not the developers
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.780]   experience.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.260]   Yeah, I would never, I mean, I would only develop for these stores, even with
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.100]   the 30% because it's just so much easier.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.260]   You put it up there and it just works, you know, and then on the other side of
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.180]   it, though, is I think that if this actually got close to something that, that
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.060]   became real, especially became political, if it goes to the house, I mean, I think
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.260]   a lot of users are going to start speaking up because, you know, if they
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:15.820]   realize that, you know, all of these things are a something working.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.620]   And I think people underestimate this all the time is like lightning in a bottle.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.900]   You know, and you don't know exactly what makes it work.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.340]   You know, every time something's working, you know, like I do office hours
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.140]   every morning and there's a lot of things I don't change because I don't
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.020]   know if that's the thing.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.220]   Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.740]   You know, like, I don't know what, I don't know what part of this, I mean, I
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.860]   know that all of this works together really well.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.060]   I don't know if I changed this one thing and so everything is cranking.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.420]   So if people just say, oh, well, that it'll just, it'll be this anybody who says
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.940]   it won't affect the store.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.340]   It won't affect the user experience is lying, you know, or they're, or they're
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.940]   naive, you know, because you just don't know.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.740]   We don't know.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.620]   We don't, and that's what to say the truth is like, well, we don't know, but we, but, but
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.460]   we want what we want, you know, so they'll say, oh, it won't, it won't have any
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.180]   fact because what they should say is we don't care what the user experience is.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.980]   And we don't care what Apple's experience are.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.940]   We want what we want, you know, and they'll tell you that it's not going to
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.540]   change anything, but they don't know, you know, and, and because if it was, if it, you
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.020]   know, all of these things, it's a, it's this very complex calculation of what makes
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.740]   all this work.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.780]   And, and the thing is we start pulling at it and it's the best marketplace that's ever
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.900]   existed, you know, and, and so I'm not saying it can't get better.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.660]   Absolutely.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.580]   I don't want to complain about it, but, but the, but the point is, is it's, there's
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.500]   nothing else has good, you know, and, and we have to be careful of just starting to
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.940]   disassemble it and decide that it's, it's just going to be the same as it was.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.860]   And then when it goes away, putting it back together will be almost impossible.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.780]   As usual, the biggest win for me is that Apple is being forced to defend in court
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.300]   their policies, as opposed to simply saying that this is why we're this, we
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.780]   know what's best and we have evidence that's best and I haven't told anybody
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.100]   about it.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.780]   I don't necessarily think that changes are have to happen.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:03.540]   However, if it is determined that the, if, if the society of iPhone users more
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.500]   than the law more than these corporations decide that this is an untenable situation,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:13.940]   this is an unaffordable situation, then I'm not afraid of Apple having to make
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.220]   changes because sometimes that's just what has to happen.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.060]   You have to, if, if again, if that society believes that we're being treated
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.460]   unfairly and we're not going to put up with this anymore, that's why that's when
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.140]   unions come to renegotiate and that's when changes actually happen.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.300]   They don't happen because of the largesse of a company saying, well, we're
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.260]   making $2 trillion, we'll, we'll, we'll toss a few coins through way.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.580]   But I do, you, you made a really, really excellent argument there, Alex.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.300]   And I agree with really pretty much everything you're saying.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.740]   But again, I think it's important that companies like Apple, like Microsoft,
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.980]   like Amazon, like all these companies are being, have to be forced to actually
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.580]   come in and answer specific questions without having to dodge it and having to
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.740]   ask, having to deal with follow up questions.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.100]   The biggest advantage of the suit not is not to be for Epic.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.860]   It is going to be for this treasure trove of testimony that people like all three
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.100]   of us, all four of us are going to spend like the next months just pouring through
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.020]   looking for that piece of email that says that, oh, we didn't know that this,
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.660]   well, there was this problem that they had to deal with and that's why they had
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.300]   this policy.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.380]   We thought that they were just being dogmatic jerks or on the flip side that, oh,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.620]   so they acknowledge that the only reason why they're not making this product is
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.940]   because it would help the people who buy this product, but it would also help them
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.340]   to not buy iPhones and we can't have that.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.820]   Well, and I think that's nice to me is I have this conversation over and over again.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.940]   And too many times to count where a developer or a user will come up to me and
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.060]   say, I just want the iOS app store to be more like the Android store.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.820]   And I just say, well, why don't you use the Android store?
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.740]   And they say, well, I hate it.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.340]   And then I have to start this whole thing about like, right?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.620]   What like, what do you think if you change the absolute, even with the Android
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.940]   story that you'll still like it?
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.980]   And right now we have these two consumer alternatives.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.940]   And again, like Alex, I want so many changes, especially for any
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.380]   developers on the app store, but you have the option of the console model,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.860]   which was clearly what Steve Jobs wanted and established from the very
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.260]   beginning.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.700]   It's irrefutable that it is that you can argue that it shouldn't be, but that is
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.060]   how it was created and an open compute model.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.220]   You have those two choices.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.540]   And I'm not sure it better serves everybody to take those choices away and
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.460]   make you choose between different flavors of an open compute model.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.340]   I don't think people use Android because they don't like or don't use
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   Android because they don't like the Google Play Store experience or they
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.380]   don't like Android.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.620]   I think maybe they don't like that.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.460]   It doesn't convert as much or it doesn't.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.940]   They don't like freedom.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.780]   They're afraid.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.140]   They're afraid to shut their chains and raise the red banner of revenue.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.580]   No, I hear you're talking about developers though.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.780]   You then that might read.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.100]   I can understand if developers said, Oh, no, I'm much rather developed for the
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.860]   app store than for the Google Play Store.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.740]   I could see that, but I don't think you don't know where the value is.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.100]   Apple because they don't like the Google Play Store.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.260]   Well, you're right.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.660]   And I think that's a very good point.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.260]   You know, and then I'll vouch for that.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.860]   You never know when something's working exactly what it is or you would or you
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.420]   would, you know, that would make life easy.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.660]   You'd be a hundred IKEA's, a hundred like
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.500]   an Apple store.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.140]   Exactly.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.900]   Ben Thompson's article, as you as you say, Renee is very good.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.420]   He says that it doesn't mean the trial has been a waste of time.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.940]   It has casted his stark relief.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.540]   The different arguments that pertain to the app store.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.140]   And I think if if nothing else, the conversation we've had and others have
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.300]   had about what you could do to make the app store better has been a
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.180]   very valuable conversation.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.300]   And I'm glad that that at least happened.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.660]   And I don't know if we've come up with an answer.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.220]   I mean, there's everything on the scale here from Alex saying, don't change a thing.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:42.500]   You don't know what what works to Danny's and he's saying, well, you should just open it up.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.940]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.460]   Is there is there is it easy to say what should happen?
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.820]   I think you could give people a way to sideload a marketplace onto it.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.980]   I don't think that's so bad.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.860]   I mean, that checkbox on Android that says, I want to buy from a third party store.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.540]   That doesn't ruin the experience.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.180]   Gatekeeper and web views gets rid of almost all the antitrust.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.260]   Those just those two things.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.340]   Like it opens up a lot of problems, including the piracy Alex mentioned about,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.300]   but it would get the EU off.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.100]   And I agree with Alex.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.660]   It is a better user experience in general on the Apple side.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:19.260]   Part of the thing I think that's going on in general right now is is people see these
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:25.060]   companies making an insane amount of money and they just say, well, we can't we got
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.060]   to do something about that.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.380]   It's a lot of it is just you're too successful.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.340]   It's the back of the Leo last night.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.260]   They announced on Forbes that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have been surpassed by the
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.380]   Louis Vuitton billionaire.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.140]   He's got more money than everybody now.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.460]   He's the richest man in the bag.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.100]   Yes, they exploded over the pandemic.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:41.780]   This sales.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.540]   I forget L H V M or whatever the company's called.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.220]   So yeah, tech Titans can eat it.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.900]   It's fashion.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.860]   I'm going to fashion.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.220]   Let's let's remember that.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.820]   That when we buy our eyeglasses from just about anyone, we're paying probably 90% margin.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.420]   Because of Luxautica.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.500]   You know, like, because Luxautica, you know, and so.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.540]   So when we talk about the real monopoly, that's not the Apple level monopoly.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.700]   That's a real monopoly.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.140]   So in a they own, you know, pro big, they own stores.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.220]   They own the stores.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.500]   They own the manufacturer.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.140]   It's like they are approaching.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.700]   They're approaching like Krups level, you know, vertical integration.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.100]   And so you know what happened with Krups.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.540]   Go ahead.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:16.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.300]   Bad things, bad things.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.900]   It's the coffee makers now.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:29.260]   So anyway, so the, you know, but but anyway, but but I think that, you know, we talk about it like 30% is huge.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:36.060]   But in many industries, 30% is like the minimum of what you want to make as as margin for retail.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.980]   It's typical for 50, right?
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.220]   You know, way more than that.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.860]   Way more.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.100]   It's 50 for it.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.180]   They make 50% margin when they give it to you on sale.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.940]   You know, those this weekend sale, you know, like the shirt that you're buying from from from, you know, the actual sale on
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.500]   that shirt is closer to the 50% 80% 75 80%.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.620]   And so the and so the thing is is that they they're they're they're paying.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.780]   They're getting these huge margins now.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.860]   Operating margin is much different.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.820]   And now in physical, in the physical world, it's a bad place to be.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.260]   But the point is, is that is that these margins, you know, a lot of people work on very, very large margins per sale.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:18.900]   And so the thing is, is that 30% is actually not that high for anybody who actually does business math that isn't trying to make
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:25.580]   a point that that's that's kind of the way most of what we buy works is especially in the high end.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:33.740]   You know, when you're talking about the expensive watches and expensive bags and expense in any eyeglasses that are more than $150.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.940]   You know, the, you know, it's just pieces of plastic.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:45.380]   As Thompson points out, and I didn't know this, but there is a 2004 Supreme Court decision in a Verizon case that says, essentially,
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.860]   there's not a problem having a monopoly and capitalizing on it.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:57.340]   The mere possession of monopoly power, this is from the opinion of Verizon versus Trinko and the con commit and charging a
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.580]   charging a monopoly prices is not only not unlawful.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.420]   This is the Supreme Court.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.900]   It's an important element of the free market system.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.220]   That's what attracts business acumen in the first place.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.660]   That's why people create successful companies.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.620]   Because they hope to get that.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.420]   That's one billion.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:23.260]   Those sweet where to get antitrust is when you use that monopoly to go into another market, you leverage it.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.460]   Right.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.580]   That's what that's what they do.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.620]   And in fact, they say a monopolist has no duty to deal with any other company either.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.460]   They don't have a duty to make life good for Epic.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.580]   That's not that's not how it works.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.580]   So that's important to remember.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:44.500]   And that's probably why Apple will win this case, even if it even if it goes to the Supreme Court, especially to Andy's point, to Andy's point.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.420]   It's a lot of great, a lot of great testimony.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.700]   Like looking at the internal conversations is fun.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:48.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.780]   It's like popcorn.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.420]   It's a little bit of popcorn there.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.820]   You know, I'm so impressed that they're so polite with each other, even when they
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.220]   vily disagree.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.780]   It's like it really is like arguing with Mr.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.380]   Rogers.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.940]   It's like I just don't understand how that would fit in with our business model.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.100]   And I have these five specific reasons why I believe that way.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   And these are these are internal communications.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   I know that they know that this could be subpoenaed at any time.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:26.420]   But we've had others lawsuits in which we don't get that same sort of thing with the old emails, with with Steve Jobs, when there have been subpoenas like, OK, I would request a transfer to the Apple capitalist cafeteria, please.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.220]   I don't want to be developing on iPhone infrastructure anymore.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:34.140]   It's it is there's a lot of arguments on both sides.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.100]   A fascinating thing.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.460]   I can't wait to read Judge Gonzalez Rogers opinion.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.620]   But I don't think it's the end of the line on this by any means.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.980]   And the EU is going to come back before she does, which is going to be super interesting.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.500]   It's funny.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   And maybe this is just me.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.580]   But I kind of ignore the EU because I just feel like their laws are so different.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:59.700]   And their their kind of attitude towards America is particularly towards American tech companies seems slanted.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:06.660]   And so they do so such harm sometimes or think they can change things so broadly because the companies have to like the well, I'm still salty about that.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.060]   Got the browser.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.100]   And the browser ballot to me like to me that destroyed so many rendering engines.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.420]   The end result was that everything runs off WebKit or Chromium.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.140]   Yeah, that's exactly what you didn't.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.060]   It was the exact reverse of what you wanted to have happen.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.780]   So yes, they didn't increase choice.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.180]   They decreased it.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.020]   So I'm not.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.180]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.300]   I know the EU will rule first.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.820]   I I doesn't doesn't get me excited.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.660]   It's going to hurt you.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.180]   It's going to hurt.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:41.780]   No matter very quickly that this is part of this is part of the the uncertainty that oftentimes US and EU regulators are
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:53.940]   creating regulations that that are designed to limit the power of large tech companies, but they're creating rules that only the largest best funded tech companies can possibly comply with.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.660]   So it's going to be it's going to be wild right for the next two to five years.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:04.460]   I mean, the fundamental problem with all all legislation is you have people who don't understand the technology trying to legislate it.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:10.180]   That's the and they just they're just they're just shooting into an area that they just have no they don't have any skill set in.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:16.140]   And that's the that's going to be the problem that we're going to keep on running into because it's going to become more nuanced, you know, and more complicated.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.660]   And sometimes that pulling knife, I was like trying to fix it might be worse than letting it do its thing.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.140]   All right.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.140]   Well, let's take a little break.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:29.980]   We have lots more to talk about, including brand new versions of iOS, Mac OS, iPad, OS coming out today.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.260]   We'll get the low down on that.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.580]   There is a security issue there fixing among other things, lots of new features to.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.340]   But first, I want to show you my ultra smooth package.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:39.940]   Do you mind?
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:47.580]   I'm talking about I'm talking about manscaped here.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.820]   Father's Day is coming in.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.340]   I know a lot of you are casting around for something to give dad grads to.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:43:00.740]   This is a great choice from the folks who pretty much own below the waist grooming, manscaped.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.660]   They just launched their lawnmower 4.0.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.100]   I do love this.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.940]   I had the 3.0 and I've upgraded.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.860]   This is a very nice choice for dads and grads.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.140]   It's a fourth generation of their term or they've just gotten better and better and better.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.380]   They brought back.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.300]   Thank you, Burke.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.260]   Would you use this?
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.820]   Just once.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.140]   OK.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:22.940]   And if we.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.780]   We have fun with this.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.580]   We have fun with this.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.980]   You know, you smell like you did use it.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.500]   You smell fresh.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.180]   I just want to say, have you been using the crop exfoliator?
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.220]   I think he has.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.460]   I think he has.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.260]   This is advanced skin safe technology.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:46.780]   This ceramic blades are so sharp and move so fast that there's never any pulling,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.900]   nicking or cutting.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   It is incredible.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:54.380]   And the new lawnmower 4.0 is exactly as you'd expect a refined version.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.420]   Every time they do another one, they've they get better and better and better.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.180]   This one has a multifunction.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.380]   Oh, look how slick and it's just it feels nice in the hand.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.220]   It's got a multifunction on off switch that can engage a travel lock.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   Because, you know, there's nothing more embarrassing than when the TSA is going
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.180]   through your luggage and there's a little little buzzing sound.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.060]   This this lawnmower, actually, if I had to hold up pretty close to the microphone
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.660]   to get it to you to hear it because it operates super fast.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:32.700]   You also can turn on or off the 4,000 K LED spotlight.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.140]   So you can shave in the dark.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.460]   Which, you know, there may be an emergency.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.300]   You never know.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.740]   You can customize your trim through additional guard lengths with sizes one through four.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.260]   I don't like the bear as a baby's bottom look.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.860]   I like to have a little bit of a manly
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.020]   that's probably too much information.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.940]   But so I like to use the guides to make sure I don't overdo it.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.540]   The new wireless charging system now uses electromagnetic induction
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.780]   that helps battery length last longer.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:10.660]   And wireless, of course, is a must because, well, you don't want to have to run a wire
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.740]   all around you.
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:17.500]   The new wireless charging system is fast, is effective, and I just love this.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:24.060]   Oh, by the way, I want to also recommend the weed wacker because this is a problem.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.700]   Many dads experience.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.180]   It looks like they're growing a forest in their nostrils.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.020]   The weed wacker knows in ear hair trimming is the best nose hair trimmer on the market.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.020]   It's fast.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.020]   It's effective.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.260]   It's all of the technology.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:43.460]   Manscape has perfected, built into the best ever nose and ear hair trimmer.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.740]   There's also, and I swear, I think Burke was wearing it.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:52.140]   Some fabulous cologne, the crop mop, the ball wipes, the crop reviver,
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.660]   the ball toner, the crop preserver, deodorant,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.860]   manscapes products always cruelty free, not just to you, but to the little animals.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:07.020]   They don't test them on paraben free, die free, vegan, even if you've got a vegan dad
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.180]   who doesn't want to look like a Sasquatch.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.540]   This is a great father's day gift.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.740]   Highly recommended 20% off to you.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.420]   You don't have to tell dad you got a deal.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.540]   Get 20% off and free shipping by going to manscaped with a D at the end.

[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.420]   Give your dad a gift.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.020]   You know they will use.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.220]   Thank you, Manscaped for your support.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:36.220]   Thank you, Twit listeners for using that special address so that they know you heard it here.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.300]   Manscaped.com/twit.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.860]   Our reward to you free shipping and 20% off.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.380]   Nice gift for dads and grads.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.700]   How is Alex's LUT?
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.980]   He ran off to re... Oh!
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.980]   Tommy on trip.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.540]   Good question.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.180]   Look at that.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.860]   His colorist has come to the rescue.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.940]   Now we're just going to have to get him a Manscaped.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.020]   Clipper because I think you need to shave.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.860]   I hate to say it.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.900]   We can see it now a little more clearly.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.740]   That's 12K.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.340]   You're muted.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.820]   That's what happens there.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.700]   12K starts to see the scene.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.940]   I can see the polygons again.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.300]   I don't know.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.300]   Lots.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.980]   Lots of detail coming through the old camera.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.580]   The spline paths are visible.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.460]   All right. On we go with the show.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.980]   Big updates to iOS.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.620]   We're now to 14.6 on the iPhone.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:41.460]   And this one, at least on the iPhone, is an important...
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.540]   what they call mid-cycle emergency security update.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.020]   Does...
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.660]   Apple says it doesn't look like anybody has exploited these yet.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.540]   And we don't usually get much detail about the security fixes.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.660]   Renee, have you been able to get any information about this?
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.420]   It's a WebKit vulnerability.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   I think a little bit of you.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.660]   Which are what a lot of them have been lately.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.620]   And I think that...
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.660]   I think people probe and look for the soft targets.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   And for a while, it was messaging because of all the Unicode...
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.180]   Right.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.420]   Issues of Unicode.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.340]   And now they've got Blastor on there.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.060]   So they're probing again at WebKit.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.180]   And because that's one of the few things that does just in time compilation
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.700]   and code execution, it's treated very differently than another app.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.780]   Web browsers have always been a vector for attack.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.580]   Absolutely.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.180]   There's also a kernel arbitrary code execution issue.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.900]   You don't want to hear the word kernel and security at the same time.
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.100]   That's been fixed.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.900]   CVE 2021 307 37, the ability to execute code...
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.300]   Now this was creepy via a certificate.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:44.180]   So we've had problems with stolen and bad certificates before,
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.460]   but you can actually put code in the certificate.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:52.100]   And all of these aren't by themselves necessarily problematic,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.780]   but when you chain them together, you can...
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.220]   Yes.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.980]   You know, you can always cause some problems.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.460]   So do get iOS 14.6.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.700]   I updated immediately this morning.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.820]   iPadOS 14.6 also came out.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.460]   And there are also some bugs fixed.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:11.060]   The unlock with Apple Watch wasn't working with a new mask friendly 14.5.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.220]   They fixed that.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.860]   Anything else.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.700]   And it sets up the groundwork for the Apple Music Lossless and Spatial Audio.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.860]   It's not active yet, but all this stuff is there now so they can turn it on with the server.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.180]   It's Twist of the Server Key come June.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.740]   And then I think it's Apple Pay, Apple Card Families and...
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.980]   Oh, yeah. Families came out.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.900]   Yeah, they talked about that last...
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.060]   Podcast subscriptions.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:38.100]   They just say June for lossless, right?
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.460]   They didn't say when in June, like early June, late June.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.060]   Maybe June's...
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.780]   Maybe they said June's for Spatial Audio.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.940]   And then, oh, by the way, nerds, here's your loss list.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.460]   Doesn't mean anything to us, but fine.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.180]   Be happy with it.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.340]   And then the world exploded.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.780]   So now I think they're busy reassessing how all this stuff...
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.300]   Oh, really?
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.020]   They put out a tech support note on a Sunday.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.660]   They thought the surround sound was going to be the selling point.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.060]   100% Apple engineers have been saying this is stupid.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.540]   Don't do this for a decade.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.020]   Like you can hear the old iTunes engineers.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.060]   They put out white papers saying, you know, at a certain level, at a certain age,
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.660]   they're like the level of human hearing.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.180]   You're sending this over wireless.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   Like this is just nonsense.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.060]   It's pure marketing BS, but then every company started doing it.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.220]   And I guess they got...
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.540]   They said you have to do it too.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.740]   And they're like, OK, we'll have eight paragraphs on how amazing spatial all the audio is.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.540]   And then at the very bottom, we'll say, here nerds, here's your loss list.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.340]   I know you're going to pump over Bluetooth anyway.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.780]   And then, but they didn't put any work.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.900]   Like they didn't explain any of it because they didn't care about it.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.100]   And then it just came back and bit them for a week until they got the tech support article up like two days ago.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   So are they right?
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.660]   Is it is it?
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.580]   An important high res audio is nonsense.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.140]   I think you'll find almost every engineer explain that high res audio is nonsense,
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.180]   but everybody is doing it.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.140]   So they did it.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.940]   Lossless audio is debatable.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.900]   Some people say they can hear it.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.380]   Other people can't say vacuum tools and vinyl.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.260]   It's great.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.060]   Yeah, I'm not going to go that far, but I do want CD quality.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.260]   That seems to be the problem was they said no, they didn't explain why.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.900]   Like they said, no, it's only wired.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:02.260]   And they didn't explain that currently all of Apple's headphones use a very lossy
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.180]   Bluetooth codec that it makes zero sense, sending a lossless signal over.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.540]   And they didn't have a wire that was ready for it.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.340]   They didn't have a new codec that was ready for that would make it less lossy,
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.980]   still lossy because still Bluetooth.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.980]   And then it just became a nightmare of bad messaging and and was it rage baiting on the internet?
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.420]   Yeah, well, a lot of that was justified.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.180]   When you spend when you charge $550 for a pair of headphones and you say, no, by the way,
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.780]   by the way, you will never be able to get uncompressed audio with it.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:37.260]   And that's I don't think it's I don't think it's it's who do that lossless is better
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.420]   quality than compressed depends on the audio quality.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.380]   Excuse me, depends on how it was mastered.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.980]   Depends on the source of the audio, of course, but that is one.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.940]   That is one thing where that's table stakes.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.620]   You absolutely have to be able to provide lossless audio.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:58.340]   But one of the things that I've been of the three different times on three different radio shows I've had to explain is that the when the
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:03.820]   in this when the recording industry came up with the CD audio format, they absolutely knew what they were doing.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:17.300]   This is this is lossless audio and they developed an audio format that would exceed human hearing enough that nobody would be able to tell the difference between this and the source material, you know, digital digital arguments, notwithstanding.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.700]   And so therefore anything that is CD quality, it's almost impossible to improve upon that.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:29.620]   So absolutely, it's it's it's no good for people to argue that you need to have high res audio to be truly audio file.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:44.220]   But this is again, I don't think that Apple should be railed over the over the coals for this, but they have to take their lumps that I have a $550 pair of headphones that can't even pass through like plain copper audio for because I do believe that.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   I mean, I trust to I don't trust my own ears because again, I'm not 22 years old and I was perhaps not quite as safe with my hearing protection as I was as a lead.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:07.780]   But when I when I listen to audio files, actually audio engineers talk about it, they do talk about how for $550, you can get so much better quality audio along so long as you don't value spatial audio, of course.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:18.060]   But most of the reviews that I've seen that compare on an audio file basis don't seem to absolutely love the Apple's $550 option.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:28.740]   And that could be something that could have mitigated a little bit by simply saying, Hey, if you don't like the the Apple with the Apple Wiffle dust, we can just simply give you really good reproduction, whatever signal you pump into it via copper.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.220]   Yeah, they made a couple of big mistakes.
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.700]   They're like, one was that the cable they sold initially was not good.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.780]   Like it doesn't give you anything.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.540]   It can't even transit lossless audio.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   And if there's one way you want to transit lossless audio.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.940]   Why can't the other white can?
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:40.940]   Because they don't understand.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:47.260]   So the the the the problem with the airpods and I'm saying, problem in quotes is that Apple designed them for a Bluetooth world.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:52.100]   Like the whole goal of those products was to take crappy Bluetooth audio and make it sound amazing.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:59.620]   Like they weren't imagined for a lossless world when the HomePod is going to get lossless because that uses Wi-Fi and they can send a lot of signal over Wi-Fi.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.260]   But Bluetooth is just the data doesn't have the capacity for it.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:11.900]   Like a copper cable, why if I buy that because it's a really low quality, not like it's not designed like they should they need to make a better cable and then firmware update.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   Could they do that?
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.660]   I'm sure they're going to do.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.340]   They just didn't have it.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:19.820]   There are some rumors that they're going to try to make these work with lossless.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:26.420]   But that's the other part that I hate that the part that really bothers me and I don't know if Andy feels the same is then you have the higher level audio files going.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.340]   Oh, you're $500 HomePod.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.180]   I spent $500 for my cable.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.340]   You're not listening to anything but garbage on those.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.340]   If you don't have $10,000 headphones, why are you even complaining?
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   That's not the answer.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   Although I'm going to do that.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   That's not the answer.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   I'm with you.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.140]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.340]   I'll answer this quickly.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.940]   I'm absolutely with you on that.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:52.140]   The difference though is that I think that Apple is definitely trying to sell a high-end consumer headphone as opposed to a mid-range or low-end audio file thing.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:55:01.140]   So it's kind of, I'm also bummed out that the reason why it has these limitations is as far as Apple has been forced to testify thus far,
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.140]   just a matter of dogma that everyone uses wireless.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.140]   Nobody uses cables anymore.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.140]   Nobody wants cables anymore.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.140]   And they don't talk to each other.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.140]   The teams don't talk to each other.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.140]   It's frustrating.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:21.140]   And the other thing is that, okay, so if you really are investing in a wireless, the convenience of wireless, look at what Sony did with their 1000s, which is, it's made out of plastic, which means it's lightweight.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.140]   It folds up into a nice compact little package.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.140]   It comes with a really nice case.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.140]   You can toss it in your backpack.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.140]   So here's our wireless future.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   Here's a completely metal pair of headphones that is going to be painful though to wear, like for three or four hours a day.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   It doesn't fold really neatly.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:47.140]   The only case we're going to give you is, again, this foundational support garment that sort of protects, basically the only thing it does is put it to sleep.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.140]   Otherwise, you're going to get all that nice metal scratched up.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   It's just, it's one of those Apple devices that I wish that the engineers would have a really good, just honest conversation about,
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:06.140]   here is what our philosophy was behind it because I don't understand what the, I don't understand what their inspiration board looked like when they were designing these.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   I think the lots of times we have to think, again, what will 90% of people do 90% of the time when we think about a good product development in general, you know, for whatever your target is, but also, you know, for Apple, so like the kids, the kids that could hear the lossless are listening to MP3s, you know, a whole more worse.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:31.140]   You know, and so the thing is, they don't have any sense of what they're listening to for the most part.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.140]   Yeah, there are some.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:38.140]   There's always some of something 1% or 0.5% or 0.1% that are actually listening to it.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:50.140]   The folks that are talking about lossless most of the time can't hear it, can't hear the difference between lossless and 320, you know, and so, you know, or can't hear it very well, especially in the environment that they're listening to.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   You know, so we have to remember that, you know, when you talk about lossless, you're talking about a pristine environment, you know, maybe not an anticoagt chamber, but you're thinking about something that's really quiet before you can start hearing the difference between all of those things.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:07.140]   And yes, some people have that almost nobody, almost nobody, but not nobody.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.140]   Like there are people out there that can listen to that, but you have to have an entire environment around you.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.140]   And I grew up as an audiophile.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   I mean, I spent insane amounts of money on stuff that didn't matter.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.140]   That's what you do, you know, and so, and so the...
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.140]   Is that the definition of audiophile?
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:29.140]   I'm a recovery, not a file.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:36.140]   I mean, back, I remember back in the day, we used to take sharpies and we'd run a sharpie around the outside of the CD to keep the light from...
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   You call yourself an audiophile, it was a green sharpie.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.140]   Only the green sharpie worked.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.140]   It was a green sharpie.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.140]   It was a green sharpie.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.140]   So, so the thing is, you know, I've lived that life.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   And I'm just saying that it's a...
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:52.140]   It is the thing that is going to be the big thing.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.140]   And we kind of pass by it.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   We're like, you know, if you think spatial is a thing, spatial is going to be the thing.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.140]   Like spatial is going to be a massive thing.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.140]   So, I listen to a lot of spatial and I work on spatial.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:11.140]   There's some confusion between what Apple's calling spatial and 3D sound.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.140]   So, I want to... and I think only Renee Richie knows.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.140]   So, I'm going to ask you Renee.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:23.140]   But when you first explained spatial to me, you said it's not what you think it is.
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.140]   It's the TV's there and you turn your head.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.140]   The sound continues to come from the TV.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.140]   Also, that's the two kinds.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:33.140]   So, that was spatial audio in the first instance, yes?
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:37.140]   No, the first instance, they call that spatial audio a dynamic head tracking.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.140]   Okay.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   So, that's like the superset of spatial.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   The spatial audio by itself is a 3D sound stage.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.140]   It's their generic name for Dolby Atmos.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.140]   If they have Dolby Atmos, they'll just use that.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.140]   So...
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   If they don't, they'll computationally produce like a flavor of the atmos.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.140]   So, if an album is mixed that way and, you know, in the... there have been like Quadrifenia,
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:59.140]   the who had a joystick and they would make the music go around in the auditorium.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.140]   There was quad sound for a long time.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.140]   That was kind of silly, went away.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   And then we've had SACD and DVD audio with surround.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   And movies are routinely mixed that way, but music is not routinely mixed that way.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.140]   They're doing it now, yeah.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   But it's been picking up speed and what it's been waiting for is a distribution pipeline
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   that would actually support it at mass.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.140]   And that's what we now have.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   So...
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.140]   And that's why what they did is so important is because Apple opened up a gate.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   Because to see that...
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.140]   Because the volume Apple can do huge scale.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   Yeah, before all you had was title.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.140]   Is... is...
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:36.140]   Well, no, I'm... and Dolby, by the way, had a headphone surround system.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.140]   Remember Alex, we recorded...
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.140]   It's a reference.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.140]   ...to make it to industry.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   Like 23 in surround.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.140]   But nobody... they never shipped it in the US.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.140]   Nobody had it.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   And...
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.140]   It was a reference.
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.140]   It was a reference to figure it out.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.140]   I mean, I don't think it was designed to be the mass market tool.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.140]   I think it was a...
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   My concern is the market has rejected this every single time.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.140]   I mean, we've tried this for years.
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140]   Apple's a huge scale though.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   They're really good at priming a market.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   Okay.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   I mean, the...
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.140]   So if I had a choice between lossless audio,
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.140]   I have some very fine headphones that cost me a lot of money.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.140]   And I could listen to lossless audio through my Apple TV, for instance.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.140]   Right.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.140]   Or...
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.140]   But they don't do spatial.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   Although it wasn't there... there is a standard for a bi-noral audio that does this.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.140]   Is that's not the Apple standard?
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.140]   So is it...
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.140]   Which would I prefer?
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.140]   It's...
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.140]   Lossless audio or...
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.140]   Or spatial.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.140]   The easiest example I can give you is like, if you're on a web browser
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   and you're looking at a JPEG versus a TIFF,
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   you know, you're probably not going to see too much difference.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:43.140]   And if you're trying to push raw video over the internet compared to MP4,
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.140]   you're probably not going to have a good experience.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.140]   Yeah, every bit of audio and video you see on the net is compressed.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.140]   Lossless.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.140]   With this, with the spatial audio, people are like 80%, no...
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:56.140]   Actually, 90% of people are going to put this on and suddenly feel like doing a movie theater
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.140]   or a concert hall and go, "Wow, I've never heard anything like this before."
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140]   The other...
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   The lossless audio is like going from 16K to 17K.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.140]   On your 1080p TV.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140]   Well...
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   For most people...
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.140]   And I would say that...
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.140]   You know, I would even say that it's...
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:14.140]   I mean, for someone who works in this and you listen to it all the time and you get used to it,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.140]   you know, the quality...
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:24.140]   The quality, the lossless, is like having a black and white image that has...
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.140]   Is a TIFF or a JPEG.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.140]   And then the spatial is adding color to that.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   So color to that black and white image.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:36.140]   Because it is so much different than what you're looking at.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:41.140]   And the thing is, is that when you really listen to these, and I've had the opportunity to listen
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   in theaters that have, you know, 80 speakers, you know, that can do that stuff.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.140]   But also our home one has...
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.140]   And I have 7-1 at home, right?
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:59.140]   And so when you start listening to those in those spaces, even in a home theater that has enough to have some surround or in the AirPod Pros,
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.140]   it's the difference...
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   You know, a lot of time when you're listening to music, it's in your head, right?
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   You feel like you can hear it on either ear and it's in your head.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   Spatial is your inner space.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.140]   So your head is in a space as opposed to the music being in your head.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   And so it pushes it all out.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.140]   And suddenly you're able to hear it all around you rather than feeling like it's just bouncing around inside your head.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.140]   And that's why it's so much different than...
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   Like the difference between stereo and spatial is 10 times the difference between mono and stereo.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   And so, you know, and so as you start to...
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.140]   When you start to listen to it and you start understanding it and you start really hearing it,
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:40.140]   and part of it has to do a well-designed spatial because you have to...
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   The spatial designer has to create the space with the sound.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:48.140]   Yeah, 'cause when I'm at a concert, all the music's coming from in front of me, unless I happen to be playing in the band.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   Well, and now there...
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   I mean, when you see a concert that's been done in spatial, it is...
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.140]   I've seen a lot of those.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:03:00.140]   And I would never go back to it.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   I mean, unless I was front turning...
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:08.140]   If you gave me one of the front 20 rows in the center with a backstage pass, I'd go.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.140]   Otherwise, you can't even pay me to go to a concert.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.140]   Well, there are... I believe they're modeling...
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.140]   And they're actually...
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.140]   The audio is not notoriously terrible.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   I believe they're like going to where Andy would go to opera and they're modeling the acoustical qualities of those performance venues
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   and then recording them so it'll sound like you're in that particular thing.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   What happens to...
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.140]   What happens to...
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.140]   I know SACD and DVD audio kind of failed.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.140]   But some of those were mixed in Dolby surround.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.140]   What happened to Binaural?
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   'Cause that was another attempt to do 3D audio.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.140]   Is that still around?
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.140]   Is that still around?
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   Yeah, you still do.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.140]   We've done Binaural through Zoom.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.140]   So we can do...
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.140]   If you said the numbers all the way up, Mickey...
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   Because the trick...
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.140]   The trick in all of this is you have headphones on or a left-right stereo.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:57.140]   I mean, it's easy to do surround sound in your home theater 'cause you have a 5, 1, or 7, 1 surround sound system.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.140]   But if you're wearing headphones, you have to do this all in computer simulation.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   The trick is better at that?
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.140]   Yeah, the trick with Binaural is time.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:10.140]   So the way we figure out where audio is coming from is when it gets to our ear.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.140]   So Binaural is basically coming to this other ear slightly slower than it's coming to the front ear.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.140]   Here's an example of a...
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140]   Your mind...
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.140]   Tells you where it is.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.140]   KU-1000 microphone, which is used to record Binaural.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   It actually has microphones where the ears are.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.140]   It's actually...
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.140]   And ahead, when you record it, you usually put a head in the middle to block out the audio from the other side.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.140]   So it's not just two mics that are separate, but they need something to block out.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.140]   So is this...
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.140]   This is not a computer model.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.140]   This is just recorded that way.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.140]   Well, that's recorded that way.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:44.140]   But what's at most, what happens is that when you do it in at most, you basically have...
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.140]   I can't remember, 128 channels to work with.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.140]   And so some of those channels are basically put into the bed.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:54.140]   So that's the five one bed or the seven one bed.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.140]   And so many other beds.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140]   But the point is, is there beds.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   They're coming actually out of speakers.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   So they're saying, "This audio is coming out of these speakers that are coming around me."
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.140]   Then there's objects.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.140]   And so those objects don't have a speaker.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.140]   They have a place in space.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:14.140]   So when you design them, you say, "I want to hear the flute floating around, and I can animate where that object is that is the flute."
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.140]   That's what worries me.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   Inside the space.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.140]   So...
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   I don't want to hear floating flutes.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.140]   Well, a good designer isn't going to go...
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.140]   Like everything else.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:29.140]   No one should use the diamond transition in your switcher, but people do it when they first start because they're like, "Ooh, look at this.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.140]   I have diamonds and stars and everything else."
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.140]   But then we go back to crossfades and cuts for a while.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:40.140]   But the point is, is that you can start creating that space where you have...
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   And what happens is those objects all sit out there.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:49.140]   Now, that means that if you've created it in that most, what you end up with is a situation where if I've got seven...
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:56.140]   If I've got seven one four, which means I've got speakers above, or seven one two, or five one four, all of those things I have...
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   If I change that to 16 channels, let's say 16 one or something else, I don't have to figure out where those speakers go.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   I just know that those objects were there, and with more speakers, I have a better resolution of where that object is.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   And so it allows the music to keep scaling up and down.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.140]   Now, the key is, is that it scales down as well.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:22.140]   So instead of being able to scale up, if you go down to stereo, it will fold down the atmos into stereo tracks.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:28.140]   So it'll build a stereo track from the atmos, or binaural, from the atmos track.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.140]   And most audio designers will admit...
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.140]   Not all of them, but this is where the religion comes in.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:45.140]   Is that oftentimes the stereo mix from atmos is better than the one done by hand, because it took that 3D information and just created it into a stereo.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.140]   A lot of people will be really upset with me on Twitter after I said that.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   But it does sound really, really good.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:07:00.140]   And so the thing is, is that what happens with music is that as you start to create, your mind will start mapping things up when you're listening to them.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:04.140]   So as you start hearing music around you, the music will start to...
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:10.140]   As you hear something behind you, your mind creates a space for that thing behind you now.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.140]   It's actually opened it up.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.140]   And when you hear something else behind you.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:21.140]   So what happens is sound designers will build this thing where you start hearing little things around you that are very subtle, but your mind is mapping them out.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.140]   And it's creating a larger space in your head.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.140]   And when the singer sings, usually the singer is right in the center track.
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.140]   It's right down the middle.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.140]   And when they sing, they are actually more present.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:35.140]   Like they feel like they're right in front of you in a way that doesn't occur in stereo audio.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:44.140]   And so the thing is, is that because you've created this huge space that your mind is kind of wandering around in, now there's a place for that person to be sitting right and singing right in front of you.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.140]   And I was watching this video where it was...
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.140]   For four minutes there was no one singing.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   And suddenly when they started singing, it was as if they were standing right in front of you.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.140]   And that's the power of what's going on.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.140]   And the problem is, there hasn't been distribution for it.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:05.140]   Should I apply a pair of the AirPod Pros?
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.140]   Oh, I like that transition, by the way.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.140]   That was a quadrofoam.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.140]   I was really hoping for stars.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.140]   I was hoping for stars somewhere in the middle of that.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.140]   But the, you know, the whole piece of figure hit the...
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.140]   Where's a wipe?
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.140]   Where's a circular wipe?
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.140]   There we go.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.140]   There we go.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.140]   Ta-da.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:26.140]   So the thing is that, you know, it is...
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:32.140]   I don't think that every major release will be in, because of what Apple just did.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.140]   Not because of anything else or the technology or anything else,
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   but because of what they just did.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:41.140]   And because I bet you that they're going to pay to take a whole bunch of old catalog and make it...
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.140]   Somebody just has to remix it.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.140]   They had Marvin Gaye, I think, came out of the...
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   You know, one of his albums.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:53.140]   But I mean, I remember Giles Martin's remix of, you know, The Beatles' Songs for the Love, Cirque du Soleil Show.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.140]   And that was really remarkable.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:09:00.140]   And if you saw it in Vegas, it had speakers everywhere and it really was truly surround.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:06.140]   And the only thing should I buy a pair of the $550 AirPods Max,
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:10.140]   even though they won't have lossless because they'll have spatial?
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.140]   It's much less than just Apple.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.140]   Who cares about the lossless I mean?
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   It's all about the spatial.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.140]   I want to point out there's a...
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.140]   Here's a...
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   If anybody wants to see if lossless is worth it for you, and it's nice that Apple doesn't charge.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   This is a six-year-old article from NPR.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.140]   You have to do it in a browser, not Safari, that will play back lossless.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.140]   Safari will not.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.140]   How well can you hear audio quality?
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.140]   And it's actually a test.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:43.140]   They give you songs, three samples of Jay Z's, Tom Ford of Harvest, Neil Young.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:50.140]   There's a World, Caridy Perry's Dark Horse, Classical Music from the English Chamber Orchestra,
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:56.140]   Suzanne Vega, Tom's Diner, which is great because that was the song that was originally used for MP3,
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.140]   testing with Human Voice and Coldplay's Speed of Sound.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.140]   So you can vote.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.140]   This is a test.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.140]   Did they show us what the results are?
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.140]   Like how many people were...
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   I don't know.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.140]   Let me see.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   I don't think so.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.140]   That would be really interesting, wouldn't it?
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.140]   Maybe after you took this.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.140]   Maybe after you.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.140]   Maybe after you.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.140]   Maybe after you.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.140]   There's not a final vacuum tube option here, Leo's actually amateur.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.140]   But I think if you have a browser that can play back, again, not Safari, Chrome can do it.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.140]   Can play back lossless.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:27.140]   And you have a good set of good headphones and maybe even use a DAC so that you really get
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.140]   a nice quality digital to analog conversion.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:35.140]   If you can't tell the difference with all of that, then you probably shouldn't worry about
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.140]   any of this.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.140]   And again, I think that your DAC after that.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.140]   Yeah, I know.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.140]   We can be absolute about these things.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:44.140]   And obviously, I'm coming to you on a 12K camera.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.140]   I can be very absolute about things.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.140]   But we have to be very --
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.140]   By the way, this image is lossy.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.140]   This image is lossy by the time you get to it.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.140]   You're not going to be able to tell the difference.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   Literally doing lossless over here to pay air pods right now.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   So the thing is, in the reality of how people are going to hear it and the environment they're
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.140]   going to get very important.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.140]   Spatial is more important.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.140]   Their ability, spatial, and it's just when it's done well, it is stunning.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.140]   You know, I can grok that because HDR is more important to me than 4K.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.140]   You know?
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.140]   Yes.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:23.140]   I can understand that it's not the amount of bits that really matter.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.140]   It's how it's reproduced.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.140]   You know what?
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.140]   I'm going to do this NPR test as best I can.
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.140]   I'm going to see if I can tell the difference.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:35.140]   If I can, I'm going to -- I will spend $550 on the pros.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140]   You go.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.140]   Just because I can't get spatial, right?
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:43.140]   Even though, honestly, it's just a pair of headphones.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:47.140]   You should be able to get it on almost any set of headphones eventually.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   Eventually.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.140]   So when will that be?
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.140]   Yeah, I just don't know.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   It might be at launch.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.380]   I haven't spoke to every vendor, so I don't know if every one of them has everything set
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.460]   up the way that it should be, but they're pumping a signal that you should be able to
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.460]   hear.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.700]   Oh, interesting.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   So maybe I won't.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:09.340]   Because I have a very good DAC connected to my Apple TV, and I have my electrostatic
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.060]   high-fi man headphones.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.660]   If I could get spatial that way, then I'd be happy.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.900]   No, I say that because people have been saying that, but Apple has a -- like they have a
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.060]   12-core processor in the AirPods, and I don't know if every headphone is going to be able
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.780]   to handle that data initially.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   But I'm guessing --
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   Well, Binaural did not require --
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.420]   I'm sure Sony will be super fast with this kind of stuff.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.540]   Binaural did not require special headphones.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:33.260]   It was recorded specially, but the headphones could -- would be standard headphones.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.340]   So how much of this is post-processing?
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:40.940]   I mean, is decoding -- is it difficult to decode this?
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.380]   No, it's atmos.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.380]   That's not that difficult.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.340]   Well, and it will fall down to Binaural.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.260]   Like if you don't have a way to hear it, it will fall down to that.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.060]   And so it is --
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:56.260]   So if I had an atmos decoder in a receiver, that would be sufficient.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.260]   That's what Apple TV solution is.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.300]   If you have an Apple TV, you need the decoder, and then it will play the spatial audio for
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.180]   you and the losses for you and all that.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.020]   Even on two speakers, or no.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.340]   I'd need five ones surround.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.140]   You know you need the atmos system.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.140]   And for someone who --
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.140]   Okay.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:17.020]   Well, and for someone -- for those who have a 7-1 or a 5-1 or something like that, you'll
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.780]   hear me watch concerts or videos or, you know, listen to it, listen to that music and just
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.500]   sit and listen to it is going to be much more impressive than it was before.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.420]   I'm more -- I'm more excited about what it's going to sound like in my living room than
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.420]   I am in my headphones.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.420]   I think so too.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:36.540]   And I got -- I bought Roger Waters, us and them on Apple TV specifically so that I can
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.620]   hear it on my surround sound system.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   But that's already --
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.980]   What's the other thing that you have for you?
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.740]   Not everybody, but a couple of sites are saying Apple told them every headphone.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.700]   So I'm curious how this is all implemented.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   Okay.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.700]   I guess I'm going to have to buy those pros just --
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   Well, again, know what the difference is.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.780]   If it will fall down to binaural, it'll -- you'll be able to hear it and it'll sound like it's
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.780]   outside.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   But it won't be as good.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.780]   And you have to opt into it.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:01.780]   Yeah, it's not.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:05.420]   But it will be much better than this for you.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.380]   That's why I'm not quite as bullish on Spatial Audio.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:12.340]   I think that it'll be a great format that a lot of people who have the hardware to appreciate
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.060]   it will absolutely love and will not want to go back.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:20.140]   But the reason why 4K became so widely adopted is because there came a point in which 4K
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.660]   became table stakes and became a commodity.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:28.540]   If you go into a store to buy a 4K monitor or 4K TV, that's basically what they have
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.140]   for whatever amount of money you want to spend.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:39.820]   I'm not sure that if Spatial Audio requires a 12-core processor inside the headphones,
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.700]   if you have to spend $100 extra to get Spatial Audio, I'm not sure that people are going
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.380]   to see that big advantage in order to say, yes, I will -- I've done these $50 commodity
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.740]   headphones that I've been using and enjoying for the past five or 10 years.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.260]   Yes, I'm going to spend $150 on now a pair of headphones that I don't want to have to --
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.380]   I don't want to risk losing or sweating into.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.420]   That's the limitation here.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.180]   I think the biggest thing of every single technology that improves audio is just simple
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.500]   remastering.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.540]   That when you have the biggest improvement that the Beatles ever made to their catalog
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:19.820]   was when Abbey Road, when it's not the high-res version, not the lossless version, but
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:24.660]   the simple fact that they've remixed it so that elements that were limited by whatever
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.820]   console they had back in the 1960s are now being remixed in a modern console by people
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:34.020]   who have a great sensitivity for that particular material.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.220]   Time for a little break.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.220]   We'll have more.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.980]   Actually, I want to talk about the new iPad Pro because of some of you.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.580]   All of you, except me, have it.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.740]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.420]   First word about our sponsor, Cashfly.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:54.380]   This show is literally brought to you by Cashfly, our content delivery network.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.900]   We've been using them for more than a decade.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.300]   They've actually been around since 1999.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:04.020]   Cashfly is the reason you never have a problem getting our shows.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.940]   They're delivered from a server near you quickly, easily, painlessly.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.780]   You probably never even noticed.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.940]   That's a good thing.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.620]   Now, Cashfly is offering ultra low latency streaming.
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.420]   I'm not talking about WebRTC.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.940]   That solution that I have let you down and certainly has let us down in the past.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.260]   In this case, stream delays are less delays.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:27.020]   Latency, less than one second.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.740]   But there are more perks.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:34.460]   They have an HTML5 player that's easy to play anywhere and they have an SDK for better mobile
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.460]   support.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:40.660]   Whether you need to run on a website, applications, a mobile device, whatever platform, you can
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:43.860]   easily embed this and it works beautifully.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.020]   You get global delivery because Cashfly is truly global.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:53.820]   The fastest CDN for global throughput, 50 points of presence all over the world.
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.820]   They just added a bunch of them in South America.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.140]   They've really got it covered on their low latency network.
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.380]   Your video streams will be streaming quickly anywhere you have viewers.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:06.860]   Regardless of the continent they're on, you can deliver video to more than a million concurrent
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.860]   users.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:12.780]   At the same time as you're ingesting thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.340]   By the way, that injustice is awesome.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.180]   It transmuxes all those streams simultaneously with live failover.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:26.700]   They can ingest RTMP, RTMPS, SRT and more to deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.820]   streams at the same time.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.420]   And by the way, they are great for support.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.540]   They will tailor a solution that fits your unique needs all built on top of their reliable
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.340]   robust global network.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.300]   With ingest and delivery anywhere you need it.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.780]   The support team is so great 24/7, 365 days a year.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:48.020]   They're always there for you when you need them.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:54.620]   So if you need more than a million concurrent streams or low latency less than a second
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:18:00.300]   streaming, if you want to be all over the world, 50 plus points of presence you need.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:06.860]   The world's most reliable CDN backed by their 100% 100% SLA.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.100]   Cashfly has been a great community member too by the way.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.340]   I just wanted to mention they've been donating to World Central Kitchen with a goal of serving
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:18.980]   300,000 warm meals so far over $50,000.
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:24.980]   They pioneered the first any cast CDN infrastructure back in 2002, their best top technology automatically
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:30.380]   finds the fastest route to and from customer origin across that global network for best
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.300]   performance and reliability.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300]   We love them.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.460]   You will love them.
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.660]   Find out what cashfly can do for you.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.900]   Find your current CDN bill if you've got one and your usage trends.

[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.540]   Thank you, Cashfly, for making Mac Brick Weekly.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:55.300]   And all of our shows, everything we do possible.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:19:03.780]   Even the video, we spend a lot of, I think it's a petabyte of data every month thanks
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.060]   to Cashfly.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.060]   Really fantastic.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:11.700]   All right, so my iPad Pro, I maxed it out.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.640]   I didn't pay any attention to delivery dates.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.620]   It said June 2nd.
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.300]   I think it's going to come this week.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.820]   That's what UPS says.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:22.660]   They shipped it on May 22nd, but you guys already got yours.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.300]   So, oh, you got two.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.860]   Is that the 11 and the 12?
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:30.020]   Oh, you got the white magic keyboard.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.820]   I can never eat Cheetos again.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.620]   I can never not ever eat Cheetos again.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.620]   I'm so petrified.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.380]   Some pictures of it, it looks beautiful.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.180]   It really actually looks pretty, but you're right.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.460]   It's going to be a real cheetos.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.100]   That's why you think ahead.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.100]   If you buy the orange one, you're going to begin with.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   Already all the cheetos.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.100]   Cheetos.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.100]   Enteritos that you want.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.100]   It's the Cheetos Save Edition.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.820]   I actually, I'm going to use my old magic keyboard because I've heard now from a number
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   of people it works okay.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.820]   Yes, they work fine.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:58.060]   But I did order the Logitech Combo to Touch just to try it.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.180]   So they just started shipping one for 12.9.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180]   That comes tomorrow.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180]   For the audience, you have to.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180]   I have to.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.180]   I have to.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.180]   You know what?
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.980]   When you see me with iPad in a couple of weeks, you'll know which one I like because
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.620]   that's the one that will be on it.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.100]   But let me ask Alex because you've got the 12.9, Alex.
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.260]   I do.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.620]   What do you think of the mini LED screen?
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.420]   So far, I've really enjoyed it.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:21.780]   It's not super bright.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.860]   It's about 600 nits, I think.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.420]   But the specular highlights go up to 1000 nits.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.660]   So it's really HDR.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:28.660]   1600 or 1600.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:29.660]   Wow.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.260]   Yeah, 1600 is the brightest.
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:36.980]   And we've Charles, who we were talking about earlier.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.780]   Your colorist, yes.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.620]   He says that he's comparing it to $11,000 monitor and he says it's a little yellow.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.060]   He says it's a little, but I think.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.020]   So it's not perfect from his point of view.
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.260]   And this is a guy who does this for a living.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.700]   This is all he does.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:57.780]   And so, but it's like he said it's just super minor.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:03.540]   And I think that because we're doing a lot of delivery in HDR, I think that where we're
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.260]   kind of going with it is that we think that this is going to be the one that a lot of
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.820]   us have as like, okay, look at that and make sure that it makes sure that it's a bit of
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   a different spot.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.620]   It's our portable reference.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:20.580]   Right now we're still having trouble getting it to basically connect back out to, you know,
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.780]   we can't do Sidecar right now from Resolve yet, which is real.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.020]   We're just hoping that that'll get sorted out.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.820]   That's just, you know, it's brand new.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:33.780]   So we think that eventually, you know, Blackmagic will give us some way to just have a direct
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.180]   link to it.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.580]   Right now you can render stuff out and then look at it, but it's not, it's not a direct
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:43.060]   feed and you can mirror over to it using Sidecar, but you're not, it's not flipping the bit
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.820]   for, you know, for the HDR.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:51.260]   So, so we're working on that, but it's, I have to say it's, you know, as Apple often
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.380]   says, it's the best iPad ever.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:58.860]   It's the question is not whether it's the best, but if it's how much better than last
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.740]   year's model is the biggest.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:01.740]   And I didn't have last year's.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.060]   I have two years ago, which is now one right relegated over here to a control surface from
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.060]   my ATEM.
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.500]   So, so the, it's good one.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.300]   Well, that's a good use for it.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.300]   That's a good one.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.220]   Well, there's the, on the ATEM, there's a, there's a piece of software that we're testing
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:22.900]   called mix, the mix effects pro that basically does all the super sources inside of an ATEM.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.300]   And so we're going to, I'm going to use it as a control.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.580]   Do you have to have the ATEM pro to do that or will it work with the original ATEM?
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.580]   Any ATEM.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   Any ATEM.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.500]   Oh, no, no, no, you have to have the mini.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:35.380]   Sorry, no, you have to have the, the streamer mini extreme because we need something that's
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.380]   going to do.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   No, but it'll run.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.020]   There's a bunch of iPad apps.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:43.540]   There's strata, there's mix effects pro and it'll do other things, you know, for that with
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.820]   the mini, but it just gives you a lot of the control more on touch surface.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.620]   I still like having the physical surface, but this is one we're looking at.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.620]   I'm not ready to recommend it yet because I haven't tested it enough, but there's an
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.060]   awful lot of people in our office that are, I don't think it's an office hours free to
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.060]   try.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:00.220]   So you can pretty excited.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:05.180]   You can at least get a sense of it and it's $50 if you don't want to add is just like a
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.220]   lot of people, almost all the coverage is like, should you upgrade from the last year's
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.580]   model, but like 90% of people don't even think about year over year upgrade.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.940]   It's four to four to seven years.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:20.260]   iPads, even pros like architects, like it's, it's, um, enthusiasts, but it's not pros that
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.260]   upgrade.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:27.220]   I think the target market for this is 2015, 2017 iPad Pro owners were, or I think that's
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.220]   who Apple anticipates will upgrade to this one.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.620]   And I have to say it from a first.
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:35.060]   I upgraded from a first generation iPad pro 12.9.
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.660]   So this is exactly what I would, this is, this is exactly what I was waiting for where
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:44.940]   everything is almost a revolutionary improvement and that it creates more opportunities, more
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.700]   solutions, uh, the then just simply, oh, the camera's a little better.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:51.220]   Oh, this number in this chart last year is slightly higher than this number.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   And this chart this year, yeah.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   Actually, I'm very excited about the, the better camera.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:01.580]   Uh, is this the same camera now as in the iPhone pro max or is it, it's pretty close.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   Do we hear cameras?
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.580]   We're cameras are always lagging behind us.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.580]   Like a pet peeve of mine.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:09.900]   I just want to, I just want to, I don't know, but no, no, no, they've never been.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:15.260]   It's, I was taking selfies with it on Friday and they're, they're not, yeah, it's not,
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:19.020]   it's not a camera camera, but it is a, they are advertising the front cameras as a, as
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.460]   a pro camera.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:26.780]   So, and it's, and it's good as the, as the iPhone 11's cameras Renee.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.820]   So they don't, they're, the individual sensors aren't as good and there's not as many of
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.820]   them.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.340]   It's like, so like the white, like it's fine.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.620]   It's probably like an iPhone 10s fine, but like to me, it's like, this is a pro camera
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:39.260]   that a lot of people are going to buy for the viewport.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.260]   It's a cost thing.
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.780]   Like putting those camera systems in raised the price significantly and they're like,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.620]   ah, we're going to, we're not going to, it's the same reason the 11 inch doesn't have
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:46.620]   the mini LED display.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:50.180]   It adds a hundred bucks to the bill of goods and they don't want to say, oh, iPad pro 11
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.180]   inch starting at 9.99.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:56.500]   And I totally get that, but like have like a pro max version that, you know, if you really
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.540]   want the cameras or something, you can do it.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.660]   So I was excited to step in module.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:07.140]   Hey, light is shipped a version for the iPad of their, a halide software.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.700]   And so I was kind of hopeful that this would be, I mean, not like I want to go around using
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:16.420]   it as a camera, but, but when I've got it, yeah, exactly.
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   And taking pictures with it is a very interesting experience.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.980]   It really is like a view camera.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:24.420]   And for, and for me, the big upgrade, one of the, one of the other little, they're like
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.780]   11 to 12 different features that came out in the, in the presentation, the keynote that
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.020]   really, really got my attention.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.760]   One of them was that it is, it is a LIDAR camera.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:37.740]   And so Alex has been, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm, look, I can't remember what was the app
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.380]   that you, that you were doing for, you were recommending for a light camera based like
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.380]   him.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]   Poly cam.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.380]   Poly cam.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   Right.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.500]   And so it's like, as soon as the Boston public library opens up again, I'm going to steal every
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500]   single bus they've got in there.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.540]   It's just the things you can do with this.
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:57.860]   And I can't do with my non-LIDAR based cameras that I have.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:01.420]   And I, it, of course, I've, I've got the iPhone.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.700]   So I've got a good, I've got the better camera, but it is nice to have that viewfinder as you
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.700]   say, Andy.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.700]   It's like a view camera.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.300]   How about, like, if you want to use it for a video, you're fine.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.300]   I was going to ask.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.700]   So for videos, for video, it's good.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.700]   Okay.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:16.700]   And that's what Apple is pushing.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.700]   Which is like, again, like why can we tell, I have so many complaints.
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.140]   You got an M1 in there for crying out loud.
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.260]   You got the image signal processor, but you don't get like the pro raw.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.860]   You don't get the, yeah.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:29.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:30.860]   That's a little disney.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:31.860]   I'm getting salty again.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.020]   I'm not, I'm not over the lack of the headphone port.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.900]   If only Apple had this, the sort of caliber of engineers who could somehow shoehorn the
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.980]   wheels of a headphone port, because that, that is a, that is a real bummer for me because
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:52.140]   I have to buy the dot, the travel dock that I buy for it has to have a headphone check
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.580]   because otherwise I'm not going to totally, I'm not going to totally obliterate that port
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:00.100]   that could be used for image capture that could be used for power that could be used
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.100]   for everything.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.580]   It just seems like, again, table stakes.
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.260]   Why is that such a silly thing in the eyes of Apple?
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.940]   I don't get it.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.940]   I did.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:08.940]   I didn't believe it.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:09.940]   I didn't believe it.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.980]   I agree that, that a lot of us would just wish that they just turned the dial up on both
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   the phone and the iPad.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.300]   There's, just turn it up.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.860]   Like how, how, you know, like, let's make something really, really great.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.460]   I think that you'd find that there's an awful lot of people that buy it.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.300]   I don't want to go old version.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.860]   I just want, yeah.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:32.780]   One of the, one of the most fun, one of the most rewarding things I did during my first
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:37.700]   like night of testing was as, when my former picks of the week is the CalDigit Thunderbolt
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:41.820]   hub, which I've got plugged into my M1 MacBook right now.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.580]   It's going to, I've got a screen plugged into it.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.380]   I got like three drives plugged into it.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.380]   I got a card reader.
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:47.380]   I've got my keyboard.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.900]   I've got my mouse plugged into it.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.980]   And then I thought, well, I wonder if this is a, they say this is a Thunderbolt port.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:56.660]   I wonder what would happen if I were to unplug this from my MacBook and plug it into my iPad.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:01.420]   And well, golly gee, my iPad now has a keyboard and it has a screen and now it has access
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.420]   to all these drives.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.380]   The only thing that didn't work for some reason was this Microsoft mouse, but then I discovered
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:11.660]   that even when I just put like a regular, just standard USB, A to USB C adapter, it didn't
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.660]   work either.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.060]   Maybe I just haven't updated the settings yet.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:20.460]   But that is some pretty, pretty sweet performance there.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.780]   I'm pretty happy with it so far.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:28.500]   And again, I'm really anticipating some surprises at WWDC.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   This is not a platform that Apple put together to make sure that Apple Arcade works better
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.500]   on an iPad.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.940]   This is a platform they put together with.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.980]   We have some things that we're not ready to talk about yet, but we want to make sure that
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.620]   next year you don't have to buy a whole new one of these in order to get the stuff that
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.620]   we're doing.
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.540]   We're two weeks from WWDC.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:55.260]   We'll be covering that live to NAM Pacific on Tuesday and Micah's going to join me, which
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.340]   will be fun.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:57.700]   And Alex, are you going to come in?
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:00.540]   I can't remember if we talked to you about that or not.
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.420]   For WWDC, I'm actually doing.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.420]   You have some.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.420]   Okay, never mind.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.420]   I'm actually not even something I'm doing.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:06.420]   I have to work.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.380]   So I have a shoot on that day.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:13.980]   Oh, and you're not vaccinated, so you're not allowed in the studio.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.980]   Sorry.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.660]   Get your shot, man.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.100]   I got a great studio.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.380]   You don't need to go anywhere.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.020]   I'm driving to go.
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:25.020]   I don't like getting the car anymore.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:30.580]   I really am like, we had a little miscommunication.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.980]   Someone showed up at my office to meet with me.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.900]   I was like, I don't do that.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.540]   You know, like I don't like I don't.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:44.020]   We have a lot of stories about things that Apple might or might not announce in two weeks.
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:49.660]   I really like John Prosser's Mac Mini.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:51.060]   That's pretty cool looking.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:53.660]   But again, these are all these are all rumors.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:58.820]   But I love the rumor of a higher end Mac Mini with a plexiglass top.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:01.420]   And so we'll just have to wait and see what Apple's going to announce.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:03.940]   It's only two weeks off.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:07.420]   We need to get Alex out of here in about 10 minutes.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.540]   So I'll tell you what, let's get to we'll just save all of that for next week.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540]   How about that?
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:17.700]   We'll do a preview of WWDC next week.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.060]   I'm very good at doing nothing.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.220]   I can do this for you.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.580]   There are a lot of rumors next week.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:26.380]   But let's get to our picks of the week next.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.220]   Alex Lindsey kicks off the picks of the week.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:32.740]   That way, if we can't finish in time, you can run.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:33.740]   That's your picks.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.500]   So I'm going to pick Unity Coms.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.380]   So Unity Intercom is the website.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.380]   I apologize.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:46.460]   I didn't get into the notes there.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:52.500]   When you're doing production, Coms turn out to be really, really important for us, especially
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500]   remote productions.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.740]   We're now doing productions where the productions we do on Saturday, we're doing these test productions
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:59.980]   right now.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.740]   Really our technical director is in Salt Lake City.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.740]   The production is happening in Seattle.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:09.260]   Some of the audio engineering and planning is done in the Philippines.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.580]   Some of it's done in San Francisco.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:15.300]   There are people, there's people literally working on it all over the world.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.220]   And the way we tie all that together is with Unity Coms.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:24.460]   And so what it does is it works, whether it's on a iPhone, Android, PC, Mac, all of those
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:28.380]   things, you can basically build these teams that you can all chat with.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.220]   And a lot of people start with things like, "Oh, I'll use Discord audio," and that's great
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.380]   when you want to get started.
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:40.140]   But what if you want six or 12 or 14 party lines that you can set up groups of people
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.660]   that you want to talk to?
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.780]   Then you also want to talk to one person individually during the show, maybe even talking to the
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.180]   ear of the talent.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.580]   All of those things are there.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:50.340]   And for a long time, we've used Clear Com.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:54.020]   And we still use Clear Com for some of our shows because it is more robust, but it's also
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.220]   an $80,000 of hardware.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:57.980]   And so that's where we had a tech TV.
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.980]   Those are expensive.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.980]   And it's really, really powerful.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:06.540]   But when you're talking, in Unity, you're talking $100 for, I think it's $100 a year
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.540]   or something for...
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:08.540]   I like it.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:12.940]   It looks like the CSPN guy is using the Streamcast as his Unity.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:19.580]   So basically there's a really tight integration between Stream Deck and Unity.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:23.460]   So a lot of people, what they do is we have a lot of Unity.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.940]   You can put all the keys in there.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.180]   So now you're just pushing on a Stream Deck.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.700]   You're not pushing on anything else.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:31.460]   And one of the big advantages is that it will just sit on a laptop or a...
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.140]   So it's not just something external.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.140]   And so...
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.540]   But you can also put it on your phone and you can carry it around.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.820]   And so it is...
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.420]   It's a really, really interesting platform.
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:46.060]   And again, it's not replacing some of the bigger ones, but as people start to think about
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.140]   how do I do these productions and how do I tie all those things in, we have it all set
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.140]   up with a little bit of hardware in our office that we can...
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:57.020]   I can talk into the ear of every person that's in them as you guys do.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.900]   You guys have that type of capability through the Axia.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:04.820]   But this is something that you can buy relatively easily.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.220]   It's really Mac-centric.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.660]   I think one of the things that's important is that it's built for the Mac.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:15.260]   There are PC versions, but it's really a Mac-centric app.
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:20.820]   So it's grown incredibly since the...
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   Since COVID.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.820]   The pandemic has really...
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:23.820]   Everybody needed it.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:24.820]   Change things.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:30.460]   And it's so interesting because these consumer price tools suddenly are going to become used
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.540]   everywhere thanks to pandemic.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.380]   And even when people go back to work, I really think it's been a great opportunity for companies
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.380]   like Unity.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.380]   So it's...
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.380]   Anyway, it's great.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.160]   If you're looking for something that's cost effective, that you can really organize your
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:47.300]   teams and if you're trying to do virtual events or even just regular events, it's really powerful
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.180]   and highly recommended.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.420]   Unity intercom.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.180]   And it's unity intercom.com.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:54.180]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.660]   We'll let you go so you can get to your meeting.
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:56.980]   It's nice to see you.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.460]   We'll see you next week, I hope.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.460]   All right.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.460]   See you next week.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.460]   All right.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   Absolutely.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.460]   Take care.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.460]   All right.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.460]   Bye.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.460]   Bye.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:07.460]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.260]   So mine is an old favorite that is, you know, again being updated and in an interesting way.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.820]   So this is from Flexibits.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.020]   It's called CardHop.
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:15.020]   It is...
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:18.140]   If you're familiar with Fantasticow, that's probably their main application.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.740]   But CardHop is the address book version of the...
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:25.860]   You know, it's funny, I bought these both separately in years gone by.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.860]   But I guess...
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.860]   That was how you had to buy them.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.860]   Yeah, I guess I get it now.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.820]   It's part of my premium subscription, yeah.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.620]   And it's, again, it's another one of those very typical Flexibit updates where you can
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:39.460]   now establish relationships between the various people in your contacts.
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.220]   But there's also a really high level of integration.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:45.580]   Like you can invite people with Fantasticow in the context and manage all the context through
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.540]   Fantasticow.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:48.820]   You can scan business cards.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:53.100]   It's just widgets because they're a very design focused company.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.900]   And to your point now, you can still, like if you already have CardHop, you can get it
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.100]   and use the same features.
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.340]   And it's not a problem.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:02.700]   But to get the new features, what they're calling premium features, if you have an existing
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.900]   Fantasticow subscription, you just get them.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.700]   Otherwise, you can subscribe and you'll get essentially both of them for your subscription
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.700]   price.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:13.700]   And they are so, so much better than the Apple versions.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.780]   It's like a lot of people talk about Apple's Sherlocking companies, but there are a few
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:24.060]   companies, a few developers like James Thompson and Flexibits that are just so good at Moriarty
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:29.140]   and Apple, like just making a version of an app that is so far better than what Apple
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.140]   does.
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.140]   And it's typically the apps that Steve Jobs never touched.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:35.740]   Like, you know, he never did his own calendaring or contact management.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.820]   So nobody ever got yelled at for those apps.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:39.060]   And they just next level it.
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:44.100]   And so I always tell Michael from Flexibits that I hate him because he made a calendar
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   app that's so easy.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.820]   And he can't refuse to use it on principle.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.860]   And now I have all these appointments I have to keep.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.300]   But it really like, I don't subscribe.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.820]   I don't pay for a lot of subscriptions because I feel like they creep a lot.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.100]   But there are apps that I use all day every day like Tweetbot and like Fantasticow.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.620]   And I really want to support their ongoing development.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.620]   So this is one of the ones that's like really courting.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.580]   Big fan of both and I use both.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.100]   So yeah, that's great.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:10.300]   And by the way, don't send me an email saying Renee's popping his piece.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:12.340]   I know his pop filter broke.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:14.220]   We've got to figure out a way to get you.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.020]   I could like a big like a Mandarin because then there's no there's no
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:17.860]   expirated con.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:18.420]   Is that true?
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.900]   There's no put in Mandarin.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:20.740]   Yeah, there's no.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.140]   Yeah, pull you.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.300]   I just have to remember how to do it.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:23.820]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.900]   Well, sure.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:25.540]   Renee Richie.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.780]   What I mean, so I should.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.580]   We should know my pieces.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:32.860]   I think I'd be yelled at though.
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.620]   Yeah, I learned from a Shanghai teacher though.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.540]   So maybe that's why maybe well, so Tom will put on.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.980]   It's pretty good to me.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.060]   Renee, was it like a particularly explosive P that caused it to explode or was it just
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:45.860]   to be prepared?
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.700]   He blew up.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.780]   He got that in video.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.500]   No, the whole thing fell and I thought at first the microphone was broken and I told
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.420]   that to Leo and he's like, we got to get another one and then I'm like, oh, it was
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.900]   just the interface that broke.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:59.660]   So I got a new interface, but I didn't repair the pop filter.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.460]   So I'm going to get another one.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:06.260]   Just there's I guess there's issues shipping you stuff because you're in some
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.100]   other country.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:10.100]   Oh, I'm just ordering it from this other country that I know of called Canada.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:10.620]   It'll be fine.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:11.860]   OK, we have stuff, Leo.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.740]   We just don't crossboard.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.700]   We'll reimburse you.
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.660]   You don't have to, you know, that's very kind.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:19.220]   You don't have to do anything special.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.980]   It's for the Mac, very quickly.
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:21.940]   Listen, it's for us.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.660]   It's for all of us that you're doing it.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.020]   Yes, I agree.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.620]   Flexibits.com.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:32.580]   So I do I don't have to do anything because I'm already a few.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.100]   You have to download a new version of Card Hop.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:34.700]   That's it.
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:35.780]   And you might have to log in.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:36.340]   I'm not positive.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:36.900]   I think I do.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.220]   But I don't have to pay anything extra because I'm already paying.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.540]   No, fantastic.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:42.940]   I'll premium.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:43.900]   As far as I can understand it.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:44.540]   Yeah, part of the deal.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.420]   Yeah, that's the only thing is all confusing.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:51.860]   All of these structure, but they did it so that people who don't are upset,
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.980]   don't have to worry about it.
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.460]   Basically.
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:54.060]   Oh, yeah, it's right here.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.380]   If you're a current Flexibits premium previously, I was fantastic.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.340]   I'll premium subscriber.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.700]   You know, how full access to card.
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.100]   I was complete features that enjoy at no extra cost.
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:02.460]   Enjoy.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.740]   I'm a big fan.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:04.060]   Yes.
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:05.340]   Me too.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.260]   All right.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.540]   Mr. Andy Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:15.500]   This is one of my favorite apps, particularly one for people who have both an iPad and a Mac.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.660]   It's called graphic by Picta.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:20.900]   And it's an older app, but they keep updating it.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:25.380]   What I love about it is that this is something for people who've been in them into the max for a long time.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:36.540]   I think I think for both Mac and for iPad, it's the only app that is as fun for me to work with, to draw things with as the old Mac draw was because there are a lot of really great.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.980]   Art apps for the iPad.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:43.820]   A lot of them are just here are 500 different tool icons and good luck to figure out how to use them.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.620]   Graphic really brings things down to simple elements.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:52.140]   So if all you want to do is design a sign for the for the break room, it's really easy for doing a sign for the break room.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:39:02.380]   If you have an idea for a user interface or for a layout that you want to do for either graphically or just here's how I want like the pictures in my living room to be there.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:02.860]   Be hanged.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.940]   It's really easy to do simple drawings like that.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.380]   It's even easy to do.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:12.340]   Not easy, but the tools for doing vector graphics are very, very easy to do.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:20.100]   It is a vector based graphics program, but it's almost as easy to use as a, I don't know what you call a pixel based.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:24.940]   So it's like illustrator, but illustrator has always scared me off because I don't understand.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:31.980]   Yeah, it's not exactly illustrator tries to be a very professional for professional trying to do professional results.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.660]   Graphic, I think you can do professional results with by.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.260]   I think the ease of entry is much, much, much lower.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:47.660]   You can just start drawing with it, start getting like a vector pen and just start making pen strokes and you can really start like you're working with a pen brush or a pen nib.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:53.900]   And when you don't have to say anything up, you don't have to figure out what mode you're in or what sensibility you're in.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:57.460]   What was the app that I was playing with the other day, which was like, how do I, how do I crop?
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:00.020]   Oh, you need to be in the crop environment.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.220]   Like, I don't want to go to environment.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:04.060]   I just want to like make the picture a little bit more square.
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.580]   That's all.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:10.820]   And it shares if I iCloud between your iPad and your Mac very, very easily.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:18.980]   So it's really just trivially easy to be on the train home and be starting work on some little idea that you wanted to show to some place else.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:22.020]   And then by the time you get back to your Mac, it is already there.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:37.980]   Way ready to be opened or printed or shared or turned to a PDF or whatever. It is, it is one of my most often used apps, both on the Mac and the iPad, chiefly because most of the most of the drawing that I do, most of the diagrams and signs that I do, they're just quick.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.300]   I just have this idea in my head.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:43.420]   I want it to get into some sort of tangible form of as quickly and easily as possible.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.580]   And graphic is almost always the best solution for that.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.100]   I am going to buy this.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:47.780]   How much is it?
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:50.540]   It's only nine bucks for iOS.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:51.500]   It is.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:52.580]   I think 20.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:53.420]   I think it wrote it down.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.500]   It is the 30 bucks for Mac OS.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.580]   And that is a one time purchase, I believe.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.900]   But seems like you want to get it for the iPad.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.100]   I mean, it's really, yeah, it's really, it really does shine with the iPad.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.340]   But we're using it with a pen.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:11.500]   It kind of, the Mac OS version does make you miss having multi touch on on an iPad on the Mac.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:12.940]   Very nice.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:17.380]   Graphic, in this case, graphic for iPad available on the Mac as well.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:19.860]   From Picta, right?
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:22.980]   P-I-C-T-A.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:24.740]   I was loving.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:25.380]   Go ahead.
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:28.540]   You both love and hate app names that are that simple.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.180]   Oh, graphic.
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:29.940]   I can remember that.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:32.980]   But also means that if I search for graphic, I'm going to find it.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.620]   I can remember it.
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.580]   But I can't find it.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:37.860]   That's why I had the picked.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:43.420]   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap this sucker up.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.580]   I was going to pick halide too is my pick.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.860]   But now that I know that the iPad camera sucks.
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.260]   Oh, it doesn't suck.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:49.980]   It doesn't suck.
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:52.740]   No, it's just the best iPad camera they ever made.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:53.660]   Exactly.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.460]   I might maybe I'll, you know, I have another one.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.900]   I'm going to I haven't played with enough to say it's going to be great.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.500]   But I love this idea.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.780]   It's called pop a Razzi P O P a Razzi.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:09.580]   It's a it's a photo app that for your iPhone that bans selfies.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.860]   In fact, there isn't even a selfie camera in this.
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:16.060]   It's only for Elsie's.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.900]   It's it's just for shooting pictures of your friends.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.380]   You can't reverse it.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.420]   And then the idea is you question Leo.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:23.780]   Yes.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.020]   Is it fun or is it a way to date a harvest?
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.420]   I mean, creamly clever way to date a harvest your social graph.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:32.540]   Well, you can't really do it without adding your contacts, right?
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:32.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:37.180]   So it sure feels like it's an app designed to harvest your social graph.
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.500]   They'll find a mirror.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.580]   They'll they'll get around this.
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.940]   Addicts addicts will always find a way to score.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.540]   But you just show yourself in a mirror.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.740]   I just love the idea because I think there are four too many selfies in the world.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.460]   So they use haptics a lot.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:56.820]   Your phone is very busy because the whole idea is that you tag your friends
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.700]   and then it buzzes you and then you have to tag them.
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:05.740]   And John Constein writing about it on a substax as it encourages men to have friends.
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:11.860]   So OK, anything we're not very good at Facebook app where you had to respond
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.140]   before you could read the message.
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.020]   Oh, wow.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:14.860]   Same idea.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.700]   It almost is brilliant.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.260]   An idea.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:21.500]   An idea kind of, you know, just harvest all of that social social network.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.940]   Well, if you don't like my advice, though, yeah, I just I like the idea of not having
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:30.580]   selfies banning them outright, but you're right mirrors.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.100]   There's always mirrors.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:39.620]   That's P O P A R A Z Z I paparazzi and it's free on the app store because they're
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:40.620]   harvesting so much data.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.460]   They don't need to charge you.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.220]   Thank you.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.300]   I guess maybe there's an app purchase.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.220]   I don't know why didn't check.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.740]   Thank you, Renee Richie for being here.
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:53.100]   Everybody should follow Renee's YouTube YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:56.900]   He, of course, does the great Apple talk with Georgia Dow.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.700]   Anything you're working on, you want to tell everybody about?
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:05.780]   I went through all the rumors about all the new M1X and M2 Max yesterday.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:10.060]   And today I'm putting up sort of I'm I'm I'm reading the tea leaves and all the
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:11.700]   WWDC announcements from yesterday.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.260]   Perfect.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.540]   Save that for next week.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:15.500]   Cause I really did want to get to that.
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.220]   But but after all, two hours show probably is enough for anybody.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:18.860]   I just need more.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.860]   So I need to call it well videos.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.300]   If Apple keeps one thing from last year, it needs to be more.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.380]   So I already called all videos.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.540]   Are are there been any yet?
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.060]   No, she did them last year though.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.860]   Yeah, she does around the daily roundup last year and I loved it.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.220]   Oh, I hope she do.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.220]   We know if she's going to do that this year hosted by her.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.660]   No, anything.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.100]   Yeah, her emoji hosted it.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:36.700]   That's right.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:37.100]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:40.180]   I'm excited and I hope they announce.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:44.340]   Well, at least laptops, if not other hardware.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:45.940]   Sounds like Rosalie.
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:46.900]   I'll get your wallet ready.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.500]   People are loving the new iMacs that M1.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:55.180]   I think the M1 is so amazing that even what I consider a low end iMac is just
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.660]   surprisingly speedy.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.900]   So I would love to see a kind of a Mac mini.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:01.660]   I get that 55 inch monitor.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:03.740]   It's running windows now.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.500]   I would love to put a Mac.
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:09.260]   I want more RAM and more SSD, but the performance is fine.
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:13.220]   I just I just need a chip that let me get to like 32 and 8 terabytes.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.500]   I just need that.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:19.180]   You ask me questions why at this point I can hold off and wait for like my dream
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.940]   desktop Mac that's not a $80,000 Mac Pro.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:25.540]   But as soon as they come out with the one that they're not proven not
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.540]   proving anything, this is the one they designed to make for the next five years.
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:31.420]   I'm really ready for a super powerful desktop Mac again.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.340]   It's it's it's time.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:36.020]   We will be doing it live in two weeks.
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:39.620]   And then of course we'll have Mac break weekly immediately after you all get a chance to.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.420]   Roar.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:43.700]   Thank you, Andy and Akko.

[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.340]   It's just time to do it, but it's all about production.
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:14.340]   But then now it's about cooking and Raspberry Pies and any other thing that he gets.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.660]   Is a very vast is the progress around.

[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:10.300]   through the viewfinder.
