[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   This is not Leo.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I know I don't even sound like Leo.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Leo is out.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   He is gone.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He's out of the country.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And so of course we've decided to take over the playhouse.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   This is Alex.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And we have of course Andy Naco.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Hey Andy.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hey Ho.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hey and we also have a couple of new guests.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Scott was not able to join us today.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And I filled his place with Fred Johnson.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hey Fred.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And also Ron Brinkman.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Hey guys.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   How you doing?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And Fred and Ron are on on Twitch fairly often this week of photography.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And also you guys you know had a little bit of history with Apple.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So I've got some some background there.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So so I thought it'd be fun to have have these guys on the show.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And we have a special this is going to be a bit of a special episode where we're going to be talking for the first half hour or so about news of course this typical Mac Break affair.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And then we're going to bring Paul Kent on from from IDG to talk about the Mac Mac world Expo.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   There's a lot of changes a lot of stuff coming up and it's only a couple weeks away.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So we wanted to really get the skinny on what's what's available there.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So so stay tuned for that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And so anyway let's get into it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The have you guys seen the ads the new Mac ads?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Has anyone seen these ads?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So these these just came out today.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   These are animated ads.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So so you have you get it's basically the standard Mac ads except that they are you know animated as if it was the you know the Christmas you root off the red nose reindeer style animation although I don't think they went through the trouble of stop motion.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You know it was you know I looked at it and I was like that's 3D.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   But but really really really a lot of fun so I'm definitely check that out.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So if the if you let me I don't think I can see I'm not as I'm not as rigged up as as Leo is to start playing them over over video here but the bad with the band.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So I can I can do that but I you know and I really should have figured out some way to do the to do to stream because I can build things in a fast motion.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well we lost I lost it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So we said gives a nice flavor of nothing.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Alex that that was so high tech I can't stand it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But I'm looking at it so it is is sort of the like the rank and best style like the Rudolph the red reindeer style thing but with your typical Mac PC standing around the Christmas tree.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's very cute.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Definitely worth checking out and worth checking out online given that you know I haven't seen American TV for a month.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So so I don't know if I'd ever see it otherwise.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So definitely actually I haven't seen it for a couple years.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So so anyway so definitely check that out also in the news Mac releases of course 10.5.6.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Who's done the update Andy have you done the update.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I Tuesdays and Wednesdays are big deadline days for me so I ain't coming anywhere near an OS update until Thursday Friday.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I did it it didn't work.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It didn't work.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It did it again.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   There's apparently a very well known problem that's happened to a lot of people including me where if you just do the basic update it will hang partway into it.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   You just have to reboot and then so what every suggestion I found online said download the full size combo up there it's called.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's like 600 gigabytes of something I don't know but it is big but it it seemed to work okay.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah I downloaded Alex and it you know it coincidentally I ordered a MacBook Pro the 15 inch and it arrived yesterday.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So it was it was a combination of a new glossy computer and you know let's just make sure she's brand new and put the new OS on there.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So and I'm installing software on it right now and it's it's it's fine for me.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah I you know I was telling handy before the show in Japan you know it's a 300 300 megabyte it's big it's a big update you know it's a 300 meg update for the basic not for the combo and here in Japan that it told me when I when I hit it it would say it take it will take about a minute to download.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I was just like I don't want to go home I got to figure out some way to have this connection at home so.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah look at what it fixes what what all is in there.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It is so there's a there's a bunch of fixes in it it improves Safari compatibility better printing under CS3.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's supposed to really make a big change to the mobile me sinking service so you know the there's a there's a pretty good update a couple good updates on on Macworld.com.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   But it is a you know I'm talking talking about what's in the update but it is within a minute supposed to be able to any within a minute of changing anything it's supposed to be able to sync that to to mobile me so we'll see how that that actually works.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But but that that that's what one of the pieces that is there go ahead my favorite I'm looking over the list of things in there here's my favorite one addresses inaccuracies with calculator when Macworld.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I think it's just set the German or Swiss German.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's why I updated German.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   That's they're good eyeballing things those Swiss just you know.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I think I think I think the German users the German users notice that the round off air at you know eight decimals in was you know there was an issue there and they knew they knew it in their heart they didn't they didn't know exactly you know where the problem was but they knew there was something wrong here.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They knew they were they were an email to Apple saying I was measuring my drapes and they were point oh oh oh one centimeter off and it wasn't the ruler because I have that recalibrated three times a day.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Exactly what what nationality could you drive the most crazy by having an inaccurate calculator.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Exactly exactly you know it couldn't have been near the French or the it had to be the Germans the Germans would would definitely notice it now there's also there's 21 bugs are updated in the patch.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   There are some security issues that are updated in the patch so definitely is it's worth definitely checking out and making sure to download mine worked well but you said no Ron you said that this is a pretty this is a common issue.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Apparently from what I saw there's a very common issue where if you just do a regular update it hangs on I think it's you know some configuration step and it's pretty obvious after a couple minutes it's not going to go any further.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You just have to reboot and like I said download the combo update which I think is about 650 megabytes.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Very good fine.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The now the the rumors are continuing to swirl around the idea that Apple is going to release some kind of netbook this is this is now in computer world they're talking about that they think that there's going to be something coming out and do you guys think that we're going to see a netbook.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Andy do you think that there's netbook coming.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   As a matter of fact I hedge my bets a little bit I have a call is going to be running in Macworld UK three days after the keynote and basically I just don't think that it makes sense for Apple to do anything that would remotely be recognizable as a netbook.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   However I really think that the possibility would be there for them to make a computer that is has the same relationship to netbooks as the iPhone did to a cell phone.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Meaning every time every time we heard about oh Apple's working on a phone Apple's working on a phone Apple's working on a phone we always thought well we take an iPhone you put a keypad on it and boom you got a phone no one was able to guess at anything close to what they had up their sleeves.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   If Apple were to produce if you try to think of Apple producing like a MacBook that would cost less than six or six hundred or five hundred dollars that's not possible that's not something that Apple would be willing to do.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But if Apple would be willing to build a brand new computer that's not necessarily a Mac not necessarily a PC just like the iPhone it runs OSX but does not run Macintosh software just like the iPhone it's as attractive to Mac people as to PC people just like just like the iPhone.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Upon its first release it came in hardwired with certain basic apps that everyone would find useful and then later on down the road Apple made it open to developers that I can certainly see.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And given that Apple has been able to build iPhones for less than two hundred dollars I'm also confident that they could build something that we can't quite imagine for less than five hundred dollars but if you're thinking about I shouldn't buy a MacBook because Apple's going to come out with a Macintosh netbook I don't think that is anywhere near possible in the next two or three years.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Now do you think that they would just use the iPhone OS to run this netbook?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That's certainly that's really likely I think it might have a difference it's just like the iPhone OS is again it's OSX with all the Mac stuff taken out and phone stuff put in.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I think that it would be OSX with but it would be iPhone OS with all the phone stuff taken out and keyboard control put in just like with the iPhone.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Apple doesn't have to create a big complicated development environment they can just give us a text editor you have Safari great put that on you have iTunes great put that on there.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   All this basic core core collection of applications would work just fine with everything that Apple's developing in house.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I would not see it as an iPhone plus I would see it as a brand new device that Apple's just creating on its own.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I do think though that anybody who's been developing for the iPhone when the opportunity arrived to finally write software for again a theoretical Mac netbook they would find it as easy a transition to make as they made when they started going from Mac development to iPhone development.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   All of this wraps back into Xcode which would be the key to the operation there.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It really is cool because I think we all know some serious Mac developers and I just keep coming back to a conversation that one of them had with Apple because they were one of the few major developers of Mac software that still was sticking to code warrior or whatever else they were working with.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   They just resisted Xcode and resisted it and there were an important enough house that someone from Apple had that sort of Don Corleone moment with them and said it would probably be in your best interest if you started the transition to Xcode.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I wish I could describe how he describes me but he said I just knew that if I did not they made it very clear to me without threatening, without saying anything that couldn't tell me that my company would be dead in two years time if I didn't make the switch.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   We have a reason to believe you want to.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Why do you disrespect me so that's a total years ago than the other developers that would feel you.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And the reality is is that by doing that it is really given Apple developers an incredible amount of flexibility being able to develop for a phone and for the OS without with relatively very similar code based.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Yeah I mean it's not like you can simply click a button and re-burn your code for a new device but it means that it's like building a different sort of toy in the exact same workshop that you've always worked in.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   All the tools are there, all the procedures are all very very familiar.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   You can just focus on exactly how you want to articulate this idea that's inside your head.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I mean I'm starting, I haven't touched Coco in a few years but I just picked up a really interesting book on iPhone development and I'm finding that the good news is that I find that I can pick up my cocoa work exactly where I left it off three years ago.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   The bad news is that I left it off at.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Hey look if you press this button it plays this sound file but now the button is stated and it's translucent.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Awesome.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Hey guys I just want to stop for a second and thank our sponsor Drobo Drobo is of course more than just a sponsor.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I think I have six of these things.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Drobo of course is an intelligent automated storage device for your digital needs.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   People you're using this thing for all kinds of stuff.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   People like me primarily what I put on my Drobo's are digital photos, videos and music and I got a lot of all of those so I have been putting a lot of stuff on my Drobo's.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   People use them for external drives for time machine and also even bootable backups.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Now the thing you're going to get out of a Drobo is of course performance.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   The new one the Firewire 800 is twice as fast as the USB safety.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You know you got four drives in there.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   If one goes bad you just simply swap it out and it'll heal itself and that is that's feeling droopy when you actually see that happening.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Also it's expandable so you can keep on changing drives up and you can start with 500s and slowly move to 1.5 terabytes.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   All of that stuff you can do incrementally not all at once.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   You don't have to pull everything off and put everything back on.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You can simply change it drive by drive.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Most importantly you're going to get this price safety and expandability with ease of use.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So this is the way I back up the stuff that's important.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We've even started to deliver large assets to clients on Drobo's just because we just wanted to be safe.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So definitely check it out.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   If you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak you can get $50 off your own Drobo.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   So it's $50 off.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   This is only good until December 21st of this year.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   So don't wait.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Go to Drobo.com/Macbreak and get your Drobo today.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Now this is a netbook that might make sense given that Apple, the desktop sales have slowed dramatically.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This is in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The Apple's overall sales have dropped 1% from a year ago while PC sales have rose 2%.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   An analyst says that 35% drop in sales of desktop Macs.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I think that's just a big drop.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   What were we saying Ron?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   That's a big drop isn't it?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It's got to be a little bit worrying to them.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   They've got to figure out some way of capturing.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I mean the problem is a laptop is something that you kind of want to show off a little bit.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You carry around and it's the sexiness factor of it is a bigger part of the equation I think.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It's part of this connected to the issue that there seems to be this kind of yoyo that goes back and forth between laptops being fast enough where you feel like you can really do hands.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   You feel like you can really do heavy work on them.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I think that there was a time when our laptop in 2000 or 1999 or whatever the laptop was as fast as the desktop was.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   But the issue is that you get into the situation I think for a lot of people that a laptop does everything that they needed to do as fast as they needed to do and it's portable.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Is that part of the issue is that they just don't feel like they need it?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Yeah, I mean there's a philosophy of just good enough that is that we tend to overlook.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I mean for the past few weeks I've been looking at these little pocket HD cameras and of course I mean I have the nice camera and I have friends who have nicer, nicer, nicer cameras than that.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And I'm amazed that I can see defects in some of these videos that to me are glaringly obvious but when I show to my sister or when I show to my aunt they're like,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   "Oh wow, that's great. That's better than I've ever seen video before. This is great. It's only $179."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Yeah, but don't you see the purple to red fringing in the highlights?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The what to what to what?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Well, again, if Apple wants to simply say we're going to make computers that are fast enough for just about everybody and we're not going to care about people who want to melt their faces with renders, that might be okay.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I know my wife has got one of the Flip HD cameras and it is the simplest camera I've ever seen in my life and she just pulled it right out of her pocket and boomed she's shooting video.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And then there's not a lot of settings, there's not a lot of figure.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Now I noticed in low light how bad the grain is.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   That's what drives me crazy.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Alex, speaking to what Andy was talking about, computers being just good enough, for me, the iMac has just come along so far in the past couple years that at some point, I think even when I was macking Apple, it was this iMac, this beautiful piece of machine that I could just sit on my desk and have nothing else around it with a little wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   The ultimate in minimalism was almost the holy grail.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Half of our computers in the office, we have a Mac Pros, we've got 2G5's that are acting as servers, that's about it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Half of our machines are Mac Pros and the other half are iMacs and we're doing production work.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   The amazing thing is earlier this year, I replaced 3 different desktop, typical mailbox size machines, Macs and PCs with 1 big screen iMac.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And because I just did the usual upgrade which is I don't have time to really pack up the old Mac, I'll just take this new Mac, I'll put the old one on the floor, put the new one in its place and just get to it when I get to it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And I just, over the course of the next week, I realized that I don't need this other one, I don't need this Windows machine because I can dual boot this very nicely.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I have another, to this day, I have one machine in my office that's on 24/7 and it's the iMac.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I have two others that are just standing by, but the amount of power, again, that's also a testimony to how powerful iMacs are, but it also is again a testimony to the fact that again, there's such a thing as just powerful enough.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Yeah, and I think that for, I think that's the issue is 95% of the population or more, maybe slightly less for the Mac population because there's a lot of video, folks, you know, the iMac is plenty to do that.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Now, do we think that we're going to--
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   That's your Alex, unless you're Alex and you're rendering things or some at-at or something.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   We were just talking about that, there was some stuff that we need to do here at Tokyo and I was like, "Well, I really need the Mac Pro because it's got a-- the Mac Pro has two raids, one that does 300 megs a second, the other one that's 450 megs a second, and eight processors and 10 gigs of RAM."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And there's a handful of things that I need to do with that, but I'm sitting here happily working 90% of the time on my laptop here, in my hotel room, and I don't really notice it that much.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Now, do we think that we're going to see there's some rumors that are bouncing around?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Do we think we're going to see a Mac mini update?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You know, the Mac mini has not been updated for a very long time, a couple years, right?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Yeah, is it-- are they going to update or are they going to kill it?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   That's the question.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It sounds like it's going one way or another.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Both updates.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Yeah, it's going somewhere, or that's the rumor is, is that we're going to finally see some kind of update.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   I love my Mac mini.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Do you guys have Mac minis?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   No.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Yeah, I've got one sitting on my bookshelf.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   It's acting as a book holder right now.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   That's no good.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   The good book end right now.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But it's the old one.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Doesn't even have Wi-Fi in it.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Yeah, what's the point of the Mac mini?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   You know, I don't think it ever found its market because it wasn't, you know, where they tried to hit the ultra-low-cost PC platform, or, you know, what was it supposed to be?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I have to admit, we have a couple Mac minis and what they're used for primarily is key servers for VPN stuff that we use within the Pixel Core.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And then also, my Mac mini is primarily an entertainment system.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   You know, it's basically the-- for me--
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   I think that's part of the Mac mini is--
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Go ahead.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Yeah, I was going to say, where's that line between Mac mini and Apple TV?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Well, I feel like--
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I feel like if you just want a real simple thing, you throw the Apple TV on.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   If you want the Apple TV on steroids, to me, the Mac mini is like the perfect solution for that.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Andy, what were you going to say?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Oh, I was going to-- I was going to underscore what you're saying because most of the people that I know that are--
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   there are two classes of people at polar opposites of the usual market that are using Mac minis.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Every time I see them, it's either exactly the way that you use it.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It's right there next to the Blu-ray player, plugged into the HD TV, which is a really important use.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I mean, we're going to see more and more machines that have to be designed that way because more and more people are getting their entertainment from Hulu, from Netflix streaming.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I mean, I've upgraded all my entire house to copper instead of Wi-Fi chiefly because I shuttle so much entertainment over my home network.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   So in a way, this is going-- in a way, the Mac mini is going to be one of the most important machines in the product line if they decide to really step it up and behave as though they think this is a serious computer.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   But the other thing is that if they-- Apple has the choice between either revamping the Mac mini or getting rid of the Mac mini entirely and just putting real resources into making the Apple TV into the definitive home media computer.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   If they were to get partnerships with Hulu, if they were to get partnerships with Netflix, they say, "Look, we will support any protected protocol you want.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   We just want to have that menu item in our top menu saying, "Show me NBC programming. Show me CBS programming. Show me full episodes.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   We are willing to work together to finally get-- to make people really have to think hard about whether they want to spend $150 on a Blu-ray player or $200 on an Apple TV.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Right now, I have to say that given that every Blu-ray title cost me $30 or, you know, I have a friend who buys lots of Blu-ray titles or at least they'll call me-- cost me a few gallons of gas driving to borrow money.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Or I can get an immense amount of really good content through the Apple TV. I would be very, very tempted to go Apple TV if I had to choose one or the other.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Well, and I think that that is the big thing. Like, I would love to-- now that I've been able to test and play around with a little bit of the Netflix stuff, I would love to have that easily accessible through front row.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   You know, that's the real problem right now with a lot of these things is it's still kind of this weird web-based Hulu has the same issue where, you know, the reason-- I mean, one of the reasons that I like using the Mac mini is because I can go to the web page and play it and then go to full screen and do all that stuff, but it'd be really nice if we got rid of the web interface.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You know, for that piece.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Now, that's exactly it. I think it's-- I do think that that's the sweet spot for this type of device is that, you know, a home entertainment system, but it's also a computer for the people that don't really want a separate machine.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I mean, if you've got enough people to have high definition monitors, television sets, you know, that's reasonable for doing general PC kind of things on it.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   It's just web browsing. And it gets a convergence.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I think Apple's always tried to do that with the mini. I remember-- I think I've been out of Apple long enough that I can talk about this without having people in dark suits show up on my door, but I remember one of the early prototypes for the mini had the dock on the top of it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I mean, we're really looking at this. It's, you know, it's a media station.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Right.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Right.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And now the Amazon is trying to still cut into Apple's iTunes share and not very effectively.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   The Amazon is still-- this is according to electronic-- Electronista is-- they're still as little as 5% and as much as 10% of the market, while the Apple store continues to have 70% or more of the market.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Now, what does Amazon have to do to get some respect?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Well, you know, I kind of think that they have it already.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   This is a lot like saying that CBS are foolish because Jay Leno beats David Letterman in the ratings.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   The answer to that complaint is that, well, guess what the ratings were on CBS from 1135 to 1235 every single night before they gave Letterman his own show.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   They were nothing.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Right.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   So the fact that they are rating-- they're putting up actual considerable numbers is nothing to be ashamed of.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And I think that until that they get someone to really just turn their MP3 store into an Ajax wet dream and give them-- give the people a music browsing and buying experience that is even half as good as iTunes, then that's the limiting factor that they've got.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I know.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I buy more on Amazon than I do on iTunes.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   iTunes is simply that real quick, oh, I just want to listen to that song right now.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's 99 cents.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I'll do it.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Amazon is this.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I want to keep that song.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   That's something I want to add to my library.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And I want to make sure that it's not going to get gummed up when I move computers or iPad or iPad or iPad.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   That's the thing that I notice.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And I think that we're probably in the minority of people, or I'm in the minority of people who would notice the limitations of the DRM within iTunes, but I notice it often.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I'm spending more and more time on Amazon.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I'm doing my Amazon musical advent calendar from Thanksgiving all the way to Christmas.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I'm recommending a different track on the Amazon store.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Yes, partly so that I can do all my Christmas shopping using my Amazon Associates revenues.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   But it means that every single day I spend a half hour shopping for the next track that I want to recommend and verifying links and things like that.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And the fact of the matter is that it's incredibly rare that I find a track that's available on the iTunes store that is not available on Amazon.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   There have been a couple of times when I was finding tracks on Amazon that weren't available on Apple.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But the big thing is that of the 15 or 16 tracks I've done so far, I think I've only found three that are available in iTunes Plus, where you get the same unlocked files, high bit rate that you get in every single track that's on the Amazon store.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Right. It might actually be a simple problem as we need people who can age into the system a little bit better.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Right now, the sort of people who buy music online, I'm convinced, are people who, again, are settling for just good enough.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   iTunes works great. It's a 99 cents a track. They don't particularly care.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   That's DRM because, well, all their music players are Apple anyway, so who really cares about that.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I think that as more consumers age into the system where they're no longer just downloading files illegally, they do want to just buy most of their music online, they're going to really appreciate that.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Well, and now Apple, it sounds like they're continuing this discussion with the labels to get DRM-free or more DRM-free for the iTunes music store.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Of course, the labels are pushing back. Universal wants watermarking as a security mat. This is rumored. Universal wants watermarking.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Sony is asking for agency, which means that they're considered the real vendor for the tracks, and it gives them an authority over how the music is sold.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Do we think Apple's going to actually do that?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Yeah. One thing that if you know about Apple, it's that they're very, very reasonable to other outside demands.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   They're part of it.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Especially, are they going to count out, especially to Sony?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Historically, the very, very worst company when it comes to DRM, one of the first...
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   It's very rare that I write a column where I have to read it and reread it three times, three or four times just to make sure, over two days, to make sure that, you know, Andy, you are really calling these people absolute morons.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Are you just upset with them for this point? Are they really that stupid?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And when Sony started releasing their first...
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   When they finally realized that people don't want to have their music on cassette tapes or CDs, that maybe this digital music thing was actually quite useful, they released their first MP3 players, but it used a special Sony format that would...
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   And this is almost impossible to even imagine these days.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   It would look for all the MP3s on your hard drive, and without asking you, it would DRM them all with Sony copy protection.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   There's a nice thinking right, a thinking out of the box.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Exactly, not only that, but some bizarre stupid scheme where if you copied a track that you owned and you legally had ripped from a CD, it would then check it out of your home library so it could not be played until you checked it back in again and removed it from the device.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   So I'm sure, so I think they can use some of that respect they've earned with a consumer base and with Apple to, again, hold their feet to the fire and finally do what's right for consumers because you don't want fewer lesser choice, don't they?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah, we'll see how that turns out.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Yeah, the thing is, what's amazing is that I feel like Apple's taking them this far by creating something that was easy, creating something that was simple, and they just want to muck it up.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   No matter what, no matter what.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Well, it's the same reason why the electric car, there's a documentary, What Killed You, The Electric Car, it's the same reason why the audio industry didn't really crust all those cars and stop making them just as soon as they were able to get that legislation.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   California overturned.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   It's not that they don't want to make money, it's not that they don't want to develop new markets, it's not that they don't want to be successful, but it is in the nature of business that when an outside party tells you exactly how you're going to run your business to just on general principles say, well, no, we get to make our own decisions.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It's our own money and it's our own future here.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So if you tell us that this is how we have to sell music, we're going to tell you that we want more influence than that.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I just don't think they're going to be successful.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   This would have been a great idea for them to have three or four years ago, but at this point, we talk about what would it take to get the iTunes store to lose 20% markets share.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You have to start with an asteroid tumbling through space that NASA is desperately tracking and that a ragtag group of oil engineers are unable to detonate before it hits Cupertino.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Then you're in there with a chance at least.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Fred Ron, is there any way for someone to really dig into the Apple lead as far as online music?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   I think I'm the consummate consumer here.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I'm part of the ecosystem that has bought into the iPhone, the iPod.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I've got my Macs, I've got my Apple TV downstairs.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I don't really, right now, I don't have a need to stray outside of the compound.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I'm very happy inside and the Kool-Aid is warm.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I get my music.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I can't remember the last time I went and booted up acquisition or something to go find some music.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It's easier just to pay the 99 cents.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I might be an edge case.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Well, it's fair disclosure.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   First of all, I'm sitting in an office at Amazon Incorporated.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I forgot.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I forgot.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   They have a slight...
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Sorry, that's a red fine print there, Ron.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   It's good you mentioned that.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   The thing is, is that I've known Ron for so long.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   I forgot Ron has recently started working for Amazon.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What was thinking my head was mostly that Ron used to work at Apple.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   That would be when I brought him on.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I forgot that...
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Yeah, I guess I'll say that I have a perspective.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   On both sides of it.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   That's going to go facey.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You can find out meaning slightly.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I'll say...
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I was just going to say something.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Go ahead.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   No, I was just saying you find an album on iTunes.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You can immediately get an email saying, "Ron, can you come to HR and bring everything your desk to you?"
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   No pressure.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I'm going to think just...
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   No pressure.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I will say that it is not purely fear that drives me to purchase everything from Amazon at this point.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I do.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I buy everything on Amazon because I just don't want the DRM on it.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I've been doing that prior to coming to work here.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   The big problem is clearly discoverability really.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   A lot of people still just don't know that they can get MP3s just as easily off of Amazon.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It is.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   The downloader works really well, but the search through the Amazon Web Store is atrocious.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   That's all I have to say.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I buy it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   It's like I do it because I don't want the DRM specifically.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I don't care about the price.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I'm pretty insensitive to it.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Plus or minus 10 cents.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I don't really care.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   But the DRM thing is slapping me all the time.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I go to Amazon to buy it, but man, finding something there is especially a little bit
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   of plug-in for iTunes or something that actually takes you over to Amazon, what you find it
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   under iTunes.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I haven't seen that.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I think there is something like that out there.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Okay.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Definitely check that out.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Now, before we run out of time, I know he's got a hard out.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I want to bring in Paul Kent.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Paul, are you there?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm here.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Excellent.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Paul is, you run the show over there for Macworld, right?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   That's right.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   I'm the general manager for all things Macworld conference expo.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   This is new for us, bringing Paul in to give us a little bit of a preview of what's coming
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   up in Macworld.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Now, what has changed Paul for Macworld this year?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   This is the 25th year of Macworld.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   We've been doing this since 1985 in San Francisco.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   The show, I think, does a good job of constantly evolving to be a mirror of what goes on in
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   the marketplace.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   The things that are of particular interest to people now that weren't necessarily of interest
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   to people five years ago, for example, digital photography, of course, is huge.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Videography continues to be important.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Music continues to be important.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   As Apple makes these inroads into enterprise markets, we have a very strong presence at
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Macworld Conference Expo of both enterprise exhibitors on the show floor.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We've got this thriving conference called MacIT where information technology professionals
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   come and talk about the implementation of Apple products in large organizations.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   IT's become a thing.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   The cool thing about Macworld is that it's one big umbrella where all these things happen.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   You may be a videographer having lunch next to a head of IT for a Fortune 500 company with
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   the common denominator that you both use Macs and it sparks some pretty interesting conversations.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Musicians who meet with photographers who want music created for their slideshows.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   These types of relationships happen at Macworld all the time.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   That's really what the interesting thing about the show is it's always new because as the
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Mac market is changing and new people are coming into the market, the dynamics of the relationships
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   that are made at Macworld continue to evolve.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   One of the things that I think is interesting is that you really get when I go to Macworld,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I may or may not have in the past the distant, distant past.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   May or may not have spoken at a Windows launch about visual effects.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   The one thing I noticed, they were all business folks that are running IT departments and so
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   on and so forth.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   It was funny though, that year, this was in 2000 or whatever, around the Windows 2000
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   launch, but I spoke about visual effects at one of the launches and then I went to Macworld.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   One of the things that I noticed was how geeky the average person is.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I realized that the Mac user, we think of Mac users as people who just wanted easy, they
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   just want a computer that works, you just turn the key.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   But I think that I get the sense oftentimes that Mac users are digging into their computer
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   more, especially when I'm at Macworld, than a lot of times the average PC user.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Do other people agree with that or is it easier?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   I'll tell you that that's a historical point that you bring up because if you remember
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   back when they were the holy wars of Mac OS versus Windows, one of the big points that
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   used to be trotted out was that the average Mac user used more applications on average
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   than a PC user.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I just think that Mac users, maybe because the barrier to entry is so low, and ease of
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   use is so high, I just think Mac users are more willing to dive into different types of
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   tools and we do see that at Macworld.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   If you walk through Macworld Expo, you'll see a bunch of people sitting on the floor in
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   circles with their power books open, just showing different things that they've done.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Those projects typically have a malgamation of several tools that have been used.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   That is one of the characteristics of the Mac market.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   One of the things that -- no, this has been a little -- I'm putting you on the spot here,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   a little poll.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   One of the things that -- one of the Hoobody House that we've talked about in the past
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   episodes is Adobe Not Actually Able to Come to Macworld.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   What's your take on that process?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Well, that definitely is a Hoobee House.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   It's been interesting for us because these are interesting times, I think everybody will
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   agree.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Economically these are interesting times.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   The marketplace is changing.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   There's a lot of things going on.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Let's be clear, Adobe isn't Macworld Expo.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   What they're announcement was is that the Mac market and Macworld is important to them.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   This year they decided that they needed to reallocate their resources.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Instead of sending a big booth and hundreds of people to staff the booth, they're method
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   of reaching out to the Mac market as they're going to be running a public meeting room with
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   demonstrations.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   They're going to do the user group breakfast in the morning and then they're going to be
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   doing public demonstrations and training on CS4 all day long, so a lot of first come
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   first basis.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   They're not short-shifting this at all.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   This is stuff like Russell Brown coming on and doing presentations.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   They're still bringing the best of their Mac knowledge to the show.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   They're just doing it in more of an educational way than a demonstration way.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   The show floor is, we've got, we've actually trending up about 10% total exhibitors more
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   than last year.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.000]   The total dynamic, Adobe's of course a big name and a pillar in the community.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   The total dynamic in the show floor is great.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   We're going to end up close to 500 exhibitors total this year.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Now, are you doing is it North and South Hall this year again?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   North and South Hall.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Now, what happened with the West Hall?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Was that an experiment last year?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It was actually a scheduling thing.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   A little known fact is that if someone would have looked at our scheduling three years ago,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   they would have noticed that the dates for last year were originally a week earlier.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Why did you move out in the first place?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.280]   There were several reasons and some of them were some availability of different parties
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.200]   that need to participate in the show.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.480]   But basically, it was a scheduling thing.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   We went into the West Hall and last year the halls that were available to us were West
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   and South.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.080]   I guess technically we are in three halls this year because our user conference is held
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   in the West Hall as well.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.880]   And then all of the exhibitors are in North and South and then all of our other conference
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.240]   trainings are in North and South.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.280]   So slowly we're taking up all three halls.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   Very good.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.360]   Now, have you changed any of the structure of the conference this year?
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   The structure in terms of the types of things that are going on are very similar.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   We have our two-day Power Tool conferences, we have four days of exhibits, we have our
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.600]   Mac, Mac World Users Conference, which is two days, our IT conference, which is three
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.920]   days, and our market symposium education, which is always on the Friday.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.160]   So structurally it's very similar, but there's new features to each.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.520]   All of the content for all the conferences have been updated.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.600]   So this stuff is constantly evolving.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.840]   We have added a couple of new features.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.120]   We have our new Expo Plus Pass because one of the things that a lot of Expo attendees have
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.000]   been asking for is how can they avoid the crowds that are on the show floor?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.880]   Can they get some training, these types of things?
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.280]   So we created a pass.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.640]   It's kind of a super Expo pass.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.040]   So in addition to just having access to the Expo floor, there's actually an hour on Wednesday
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.640]   morning where it's only for people who have this pass.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.240]   There's daily presentations, one by David Pogue, one by Andy Anatko, and one by Martin
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.320]   Sitter that are training classes just for this group of people.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.360]   There's a lounge on the show floor where if you want to take a break, get some coffee,
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.920]   rest your feet that you can conveniently go to.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   So we added a couple of features and this is a new pass for this year.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   That's great.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.880]   And you're doing a new presentation structure, right, as well.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.800]   This is kind of the, I know Andy's speaking, or is that what you're talking about?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.160]   Yeah, Andy's on the Expo Plus faculty.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.560]   So he'll be doing one of his sessions there.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   But I think what you're referring to is we added a new session this year that's pretty
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.480]   interesting.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:04.040]   On Friday, we've added a full day market symposium that's called Mackerel Pulse.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.800]   And the idea with Mackerel Pulse was to bring some of the really interesting creative thinkers
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.520]   in the market, whereas the rest of Mackerel is a very hand to mouth tactical thing, like
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.000]   how to be better at Photoshop, how to be better at Final Cut.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   You know, very much about tools.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.320]   One thing that I wanted to give attendees this year was kind of a more bigger picture,
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.640]   where is the world going type of thing?
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:25.120]   And so I've invited some of the more interesting presenters, some of the good big picture thinkers,
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.400]   like John Gruber, Merlin Mann, Andy will be speaking at this as well.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.440]   And on Friday, we're just going to kind of relax, and we're just going to do these brief,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.600]   but visionary, inspiring type of presentations where people can kind of see, you know, what
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.120]   is beautiful software?
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.720]   You know, what is technology driven organization?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.640]   A lot of really interesting things.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.560]   And on that Mackerel Pulse, just to kind of further the cause of this kind of inspiration,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.120]   we have two musical performances.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.400]   One, the Stanford laptop orchestra.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.240]   They'll be doing a performance.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.760]   And then we have a group coming over.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.480]   The John Lennon bus folks are flying in a group called Liana, which is a bunch of disabled
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.640]   musicians from West Africa are actually, they're on tour in the United States, and they'll
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.040]   be coming to Mackerel and it's really fascinating.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.920]   The music is, you know, it is culturally, you know, it's African style music, but we'll
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.560]   be recording it all, of course, using Macs and Final Cut, and then we'll be making that
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   available to attendees afterwards.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.280]   So performance, vision, creativity, inspiration, all this good stuff is going to be happening
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.240]   at the Mackerel Pulse Symposium.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.400]   Andy, is that the only place you're speaking?
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.840]   Or do you have a couple of other things going on?
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.960]   Well, in addition to, again, if there's a point at which I'm breathing in and breathing
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.240]   out and I have that kind of time, I haven't scheduled myself enough.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.000]   So I'm going to be doing some time at Wiley Publishing's booth doing a session just to
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.760]   talk about the iPhone book.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.160]   I'm going to be at the Mac user group thing, talking for about an hour there.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.440]   I'm going to be here there and everywhere.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.520]   I'm going to be like that fungus that they closed down the entire facility for a week
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.480]   later, so they can tent and spray.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:10.200]   I'm afraid Mackerel for me generally is the day after I go into near Comatose State for
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   about three or four days and then I kind of come out of the fog.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.880]   I know that I've done it well.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   If on the plane ride home, I take the red eye home, that's like a six hour flight back
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.560]   to the east coast and everyone's asleep.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.720]   If I can still hear like that background, static chat or a hundred people talking at
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.520]   a time, I know that I definitely did do the full immersion thing at Mackerel.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.080]   It's one of those few opportunities that you can really dive in and just submerge yourself
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.720]   in the Macintosh experience for four or five days.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.280]   That's why it always, every year I have to make that decision because CES is usually
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.880]   about the same, either the week before or the exact same week.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.760]   It's always, why would I want to go to CES when I could again totally lose my mind at
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   Mackerel.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.360]   You know, I mean, it checks in the mail.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.160]   Well, keep coming.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Keep coming.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.400]   And the thing for people to also keep in mind is that there's a lot of events that are
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.000]   happening around Mackerel.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.160]   It's typically, you know, it's in Mackerel, around Mackerel.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:19.240]   And one of the places that I know I go pretty often is the, do you guys go to Eileen's machine.com,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   the party list?
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.160]   Have you seen the party list?
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.520]   Yeah, I haven't been Eileen's machine yet.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:32.200]   She tries to be like the central focus, the center of where you can go to find out where
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.440]   you can get a free drink or free your gerve.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   Exactly.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.840]   Or at least find someone to at least talk about, talk to for a while and make your conversation
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   test deductible.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840]   Exactly.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.800]   If you're looking around for things to do, places to be, there is, if you go to Eileen
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.820]   machine.com/playlist.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.160]   S-H-T mail.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.400]   There's all these different parties, all the flock of birds of a feather.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.000]   I want to say flock of a feather, but birds of a feather meetings.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.440]   I know the one that I'm going to be going to is on Wednesday, there is, of course, the
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:11.400]   Final Cut Pro Super Meat, which tends to be usually a pretty amazing event.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.360]   I'm going to be going to that among other things.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.720]   Definitely worth checking out if you're coming into town and looking for somewhere to go.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.360]   Any last words, Paul, that we missed about the conference?
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.560]   I don't think that you didn't miss anything, but these things that you guys have just been
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.400]   saying, that's really the point of macro.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.280]   It's all about this organic social happenings.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.640]   It's just a very interesting place.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.120]   If any of your listeners haven't been yet, we've got a code here where you can actually
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.120]   do some giveaways.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   Fantastic.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.360]   We get 100 people to come as guests of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.680]   I'll give that to you in a second.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.760]   Mostly, it's really what Andy was saying.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.400]   It's a week where you do a lot of stuff.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:56.000]   You do a lot of walking, you do a lot of talking, you do a lot of social networking.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.080]   It's really that place where the face-to-face experience is a value add.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.960]   You make friends at Macroll, you make professional contacts, you learn stuff, you learn about
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.600]   new products.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.760]   It's very different than what most people would think of when they think of a trade
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   show.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.720]   Attendees who have been year after year after year and keep coming, they know it's going
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.960]   to be this crazy intense environment yet they keep coming because there's a lot that
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.200]   they get out of it.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.040]   This year's show between our art galleries and our musical performances and our great
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.760]   conference sessions and just everything we have going on, it's a really, really fun
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   week.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.480]   If you haven't been, I just really want to encourage people to use this free pass that
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.400]   I'm about to give you and see if you guys can come.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   Ready?
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   We're ready.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   We're ready.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.240]   If you go to the Macroll.xpo.com website, the first thing you'll be asked for is a discount
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   code.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:52.080]   If people use a discount code, R as in Ronald, I as in NOTCO, D as in Dan, P as in Paul,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:57.480]   1-6-4-1, that's R-I-D-P, 1-6-4-1.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.200]   First 100 people will get a free pass and then everybody after that will get $20 off
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.960]   of an Expo pass as well.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   How much is the Expo pass normally?
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   $45.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:12.440]   So you have $20 off and now people are going to really wish that they had downloaded.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.760]   This is the one advantage of having the podcast without Leo is that if it was live, if we
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.680]   were recording this and it was up on live TV, the passes would be gone right now.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.120]   You know what actually Alex gets over there.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.400]   The one thing we probably should mention is that our Thursday feature presentation open
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.240]   to all attendees is Mr. Leo Laport.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   Yes.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.680]   So Thursday and that's open to anybody coming to it with any pass, right?
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.560]   Anybody with any pass, 9 a.m. on Thursday morning can come see Leo talk and so we're
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   really happy that Leo is going to be one of our featured presenters.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.920]   I mean the other featured presenters are like David Pogue and then Mac Club Magazine does
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.240]   their best of show.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.760]   So yeah, this is open to anybody and we hope to have a great crowd for Leo as he kind of
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   talks about new media and the Mac market and his experiences in the technology market.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.520]   And Steve's presentation is on Tuesday?
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   Now we haven't made any announcement about the keynote yet.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   There we go.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.720]   So no announcement yet but hopefully we'll see something there.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.480]   Our IDP 1641 is the code.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.880]   Paul, thanks so much for joining us.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.160]   Pleasure talking to you guys.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.160]   We'll see you at the show.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.960]   All right, thanks.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   He was pretty cagey.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.520]   I bet the keynote is going to be by Brangelina.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.000]   Pretty sweet.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.800]   Yeah, you know, it's different every year.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.520]   You know, they're always throwing us curves there.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.320]   And so yeah, we'll see.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.240]   Before we go any further, I just want to thank our sponsor audible.com.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.200]   Of course, the leading provider, a spoken word entertainment.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.760]   Audible's got over 35,000 titles to choose from, including my pick for this week.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   I'm taking over.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   I'm picking this week.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.880]   Lincoln on leadership, executive strategies for tough times.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.400]   Now I have to admit, I'm into Lincoln.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.160]   I think I got that from my dad.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.520]   And I just think that in especially as we look at what's going to happen over the next
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.320]   year, two years, five years, 10 years, it's going to make a huge difference.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.600]   It's going to make a huge difference not just in the presidency, but in corporations, in
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   communities.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.360]   This is a huge deal.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.320]   And I have to deal with a lot of this within a lot of what I work on.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:20.000]   And so I'm very interested in seeing how Lincoln handled it from this point of view.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.480]   So that's what that's my pick for the week.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   Lincoln on leadership.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.440]   Now, of course, if you're not interested in Lincoln or history, more interested in arts
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.840]   entertainment or science fiction or even speeches, you can find all of that on audible.com.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.520]   As you can get a free free book, free speech, whatever you want at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:43.280]   So if you haven't gone to audible yet, go to audible, go to audible.com/macbreak and
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.960]   get your own book.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:51.680]   Now we've got, this is new, I knew for Fred and Ron, so I'm going to let, I'm going to
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.560]   let Andy jump in here.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.800]   We got our picks for the week.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.360]   Andy, do you have a pick?
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.160]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I decided to call and audible this week, given our conversation
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.640]   earlier on.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.160]   A lot of our listeners have a sling box.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.320]   And if you don't have a sling box, you need to get a sling box because it's only, we can
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.440]   have going to get more and more important as the entertainment gets more and more digital.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.000]   The sling box, just to recap, is that really, really cool looking device that you plug into
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.760]   your wired network and your cable box.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.960]   And it will allow you to access all of the content through that cable box from anywhere
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.240]   in the house or anywhere in the world.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:36.440]   So you can be in an airport lounge in Murmansk and so long as you get Wi-Fi or okay, you're
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.320]   in Japan, so basically you're getting high def video, you're streaming anywhere you want
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.040]   100 million channels.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.440]   But the idea is that so long as you have a laptop with this free sling catcher software
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.120]   on it, you have full access to the remote control, you can change channels, you can watch DVR
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.560]   content, you can set up new DVR.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.720]   Just like being parked in the sofa in front there.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   It's really great.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.680]   Now they have an application for the iPhone that lets you actually watch this content
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.480]   through your iPhone, but Apple won't let them release it.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.160]   So if you have a Blackberry, it'll work great on that too.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.640]   And they make them all kinds of different ranges.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.880]   If you want to spend a little bit of money, they can sell it to you for a little bit of
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   money.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.400]   If you want to get the really super duper HD version with its own built-in tuner, they'll
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.120]   sell you that one too.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.440]   But my pick of the week is a brand new addition to the sling line, which is the sling catcher.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:33.280]   Now the sling box is the thing that once again will send out, basically let you control
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.040]   anything you want, any video thing you want over the internet.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:42.840]   The sling catcher opens up this into a whole new exciting way, because normally you need
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.400]   to have some sort of computer in order to tune in to your sling box from wherever in
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   the world.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.960]   The sling catcher is a small, like maybe the call of the size of a fat paperback book,
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:00.240]   that plugs into your HD set, it will plug into anything with component video or anything
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   else.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:06.860]   And it will essentially again let you turn any screen anywhere into an interface to your
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.680]   sling box.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:15.680]   So that's one of the reasons why I rewired all my house for CAT6, like high-speed copper
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:21.440]   internet, copper ethernet, because I've been in this house for about three months and
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.960]   it's finally time to start, now that I've been here for a little while, now I really
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.800]   know where I want the TVs to go.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.640]   And okay, well I really want to have a set in that little common area that's shared between
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.600]   the kitchen and the living room.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.120]   But I don't want to have the cable company come by and run co-ax down there.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.160]   Also I really want more cable boxes down there.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.600]   Do I need more cable boxes?
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.880]   Given that I already have a sling box, well no problem.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.720]   I've got my new little 24-inch HD set there in the kitchen.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.960]   I just plug the sling box into it and it works just great.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.360]   On top of everything else though, it will also interface with your home media, so you
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.240]   can get your home media into the screen wherever you are.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:03.680]   It will also work with a desktop application, an application that's on your notebook.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.600]   They released it for the Windows right now, so you can download it for Windows right now.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.120]   They will have a Mac version available very, very shortly.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:16.360]   But this thing elevates it from super awesome to super wicked awesome.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:22.760]   We're all people who watch a lot of content via Hulu via online streaming.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.680]   And just like you said, the problem is that well do you really want to be gathered around
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.560]   the computer to watch that episode of House That You Miss Last Week?
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.000]   Well, with this desktop software that runs on anything, you can have something going on
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.960]   your notebook and then simply activate the software and just tell the software, you see
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960]   this bit of streaming video right here?
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.360]   Instead of being, I want to see that on the big screen TV over there and we'll just say,
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   "Can do?"
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.120]   And now you're watching Hulu, watching Hulu on your big 42-inch plasma screen TV because
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   that's where it is.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.440]   It's one of my favorite-
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.560]   How much is this link catcher?
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   This link catcher is $229.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   It's not dirt cheap, but it's one of those things that will, it's a simple device that
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.440]   will give you a whole boatload of new features that you can then exploit however you want.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.120]   And one of the cool things is that all of your settings stay with the device.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:20.480]   So if you travel, you can just stick the sling catcher in your travel bag and when you're
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.280]   at your friend's house, you can plug it into his HDTV.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   Damn.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.720]   Without really doing anything, you just pick up your remote that you also pack with you.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.200]   And now once again, you are parked inside at your sofa, back home, watching all the content
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:37.640]   that you download, excuse me, that you recorded on the DVR last night because again, it does
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.920]   all the connections for you as long as you can find the internet.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.920]   It's good.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   Wow.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.120]   Andy, did I hear correctly that you, in order to use the sling box, that you have to have
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.400]   a wired network.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.800]   You can't plug it into your cable box and have it use the existing Wi-Fi network.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.320]   It doesn't have Wi-Fi built in.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.160]   You can make it work with Wi-Fi.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:02.560]   When I first set mine up for like very simple like low definition communication, I was using
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.000]   an airport express as a bridge.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.820]   So it doesn't have Wi-Fi built in.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:13.840]   So long as you can use whatever mojo you have available to you to put it on your home
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.680]   Wi-Fi network, it will work, but it does work a lot better via copper.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:26.720]   You can actually see, I should say that's a very, very flexible, non-demanding application.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:32.200]   As a matter of fact, when I go right on Amtrak between here in New York, I actually have
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.400]   like a little sprint like wireless modem and it works just fine over there.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.480]   So right on, right even on Amtrak, I can be watching last night's TV.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.520]   But if you're, but obviously when you have a lower bandwidth connection, it sort of has
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:51.040]   to drop down into like YouTube quality with high compression and low resolution.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.960]   If you were using, if you're using copper everywhere, it is practically as good as whatever
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.760]   TV you've got it plugged into upstairs.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   Got it.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.760]   Fantastic.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.600]   Now I'm going to give Ron and Fred just a couple more minutes and give my pick of the
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   week.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   Don't take mine.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.280]   Okay, here it is.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   Here it is.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.600]   See, that's how I get in first so I can make sure that I'm safe here.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:21.080]   So my pick of the week is the new, I had an old one, but this is the new Mo-Fi Juice
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   Pack.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   Have you guys seen this thing?
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Oh man.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.440]   It's saved, it has been, you know, I'm on M in production.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   I'm busy.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:32.560]   The new Mo-Fi Juice Pack is this goes for your iPhone and it's basically like a little holder
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   for your iPhone.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.760]   So you just simply slide your iPhone into it.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.160]   Now what it does is it, it's a big battery and it just simply charges.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.560]   It battery boost, you know, it recharges the battery on your iPhone, but it doesn't do
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.360]   it in a way that you have to have it plugged in or something sticking out.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.360]   It really just becomes part of the iPhone until it's done charging and then you pull
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.720]   it out.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:56.440]   I have, especially when I'm busy when I'm, you know, I'm, we're on set 18 hours a day.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.080]   We're moving all over the place all the time.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:04.160]   It is really just hard to make sure that my iPhone stays charged and especially here.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:10.400]   I mean, if you turn GPS, I mean, I'm using GPS constantly to navigate Tokyo and GPS,
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.360]   when you turn it on, you can almost see the battery going down.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.000]   Like you can almost watch, you can actually almost watch that little, that little ticker
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.880]   go down as the, if you leave it on, like if you have Google Maps on and you're just sitting
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.080]   there with it with GPS on walking, walking to make sure you're not missing your next
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.080]   thing.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.540]   So you can just watch that battery go down.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.840]   And so I've been burning through the batteries and I keep this thing charged all the time
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:37.080]   in my backpack and it is, it is, you know, I parachuted out of no battery situations,
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.000]   at least four times in the last two weeks, $99.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.640]   So it's not, you know, super cheap or not super expensive, but it's a real hardware device.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.440]   And it is a life saver.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.880]   I mean, I just, I can't even imagine I had one from my, my first phone and I got so addicted
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.360]   to it that literally the day it came out, I, I ordered the next one.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.600]   I love the way it works.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.000]   It does, it does make your phone a lot thicker and heavier, but what I feel more solid, doesn't
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   it?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Well, I mean, if you're going to throw it at somebody, then that's a really good thing.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.160]   But, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not that kind of guy.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.720]   But what I tend to use it for is that I tend to run, I tend to run into low battery situations
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.360]   when I'm, when I'm traveling because I've got those six hours in the, I basically have
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.960]   to wake up early at six in the morning and, you know, be in a taxi or be in a shuttle
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.000]   and then airports and taxis and hotels all day long.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.240]   I'm always checking email and stuff like that.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.640]   But it's a lifesaver because those three and a half hours or those four hours that you're
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.720]   on the plane, even if you don't use your phone, you can just slide it right into that sled
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:42.400]   and it will charge the internal battery off the external battery so that if you don't
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.880]   want to carry it around inside that sled, as soon as you pull it out, basically, magically
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.400]   the battery has recharged itself because all the iPhone just sees it as a power source
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.760]   and nothing else.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.720]   And one of the things that is improved either with the iPhone firmware or with the 3G is
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.560]   that it used, the problem with the first version was that you'd have it plugged in and when
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:06.000]   the Mophie ran out of juice, you'd get these alarms from your phone constantly, like be
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.360]   being in buzzing and stuff that it was, you know, that is, that is no longer connected
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.680]   or what it would be constantly connecting, reconnecting, unconnecting, reconnecting and
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.080]   you'd feel this buzz all the time while it's figuring it out.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.440]   And that doesn't happen anymore and it's a lifesaver.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:24.480]   So anyway, Mophie Juice Pack, Mophie.com and $99.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.680]   Fred, do you have a pick for us?
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.960]   I do, but I have a feeling that since this is my first time on this show that this may
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.080]   have been talked about before because it's pretty cool, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Okay.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:42.080]   Have you guys heard of this piece of software/service called Boxy, B-O-X-E-E that we've
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   talked about?
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.640]   I don't think we've made it a pick, but we have talked about it.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.160]   I'm on the beta, but right now people just keep on adding me as friends and I haven't
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.160]   had a connection to-
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.600]   To actually play with it.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.080]   Well, someone added me as a friend yesterday and I've carved out some time in my day-to-day
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.760]   in my busy schedule to install this, to get it installed on my Apple TV.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.480]   And basically what it is, it's a little piece of software that adds functionality to your
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.920]   Apple TV to allow you to watch content or streaming content from online services like
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:22.560]   Hulu, CBS, Comedy Central, Netflix, music from Last FM, photos from Flickr.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.760]   It'll even Twitter what you're watching, which can be dangerous.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   I don't know if I know that far.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   I know that.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.640]   The Twitterverse if you want to, but for me, the UI is really slick.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.360]   It would definitely get the Apple stamp of approval if I were in that UI department,
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.040]   but it looks really, really good.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.680]   For me, like you guys were saying earlier, I consume a lot of my television through services
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.840]   like Hulu and the various other online entities.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   And it's sort of the missing gap or the missing puzzle piece and all that was, "Man, wouldn't
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.960]   it be great if I could watch this stuff on the HDTV in the living room?"
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:09.200]   You know, in granted, the Xbox has Netflix on it now and the Tivo has some of that stuff.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.280]   But to have all these services in a nice, glossy, sexy UI that I can go in and say, "You
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280]   know what?
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.840]   I feel like watching $6 million man.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.040]   I can click on it and watch it directly on the big screen."
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   Fantastic.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.640]   So, Boxy, do you need a code, right?
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   This is still in beta?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   It's still in beta.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.680]   I'm going to sign up and I would anticipate that they will send you a eventually access
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.880]   to it, but I was lucky enough to have a buddy that was trying it already and sending me
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880]   a code.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.560]   So, I was able to get up and running relatively quickly.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.240]   And that's a boxy with two E's, right?
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.240]   Go ahead, Alex.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   It's Boxy with two E's.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   Boxy, yeah.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.080]   www.boxie.tv is there your URL.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080]   Perfect.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   Perfect.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.080]   And Ron, do you have a pick?
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080]   Sure.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080]   I do.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.680]   I'm -- after what I would call a few learning experiences with backups and having files
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:13.480]   backed up, I've come to the conclusion that even having a local drive and everything on
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.600]   a Drobo is not enough.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.520]   And so, I'm always looking for what I want to do for kind of a cloud backup or some kind
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.520]   of off-site backup.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.800]   And for a while, I've been using Mozy and I've had problems with it, I'll say.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.440]   But there's a new service, I guess, at least new to the Mac, called Backblaze.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.480]   I don't know if anybody has talked about this yet.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   Have you guys heard of this?
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.280]   No, haven't touched it.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.200]   So it's similar to Mozy in the sense that it's designed to be this kind of low-level
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.000]   background process that's always kind of pushing updates to the cloud, to their service.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.400]   And what that means is that rather than every night you go back up, it really means that
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:54.120]   even during the day, you change a document or something theoretically, it's kind of watching
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.400]   that and assuming everything's already up on the cloud, it'll just update the latest
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400]   things you've done.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.760]   So it gives you an even stronger level of protection than something that's like a nightly
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.760]   backup.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.400]   Now, does it look, does it wait for you not to be using the internet?
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.400]   Is that, is it?
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.320]   Yeah, so typically it has sort of, there's a few things that it does.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   It certainly looks for activity on the system.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.840]   There's also a setting for sort of how much it throttles the upload.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.800]   So if you're on a limited bandwidth network, then you can just sort of set it low and it's
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.760]   going to go as a low-level background.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.640]   General, I've only been playing with it for about a week now.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.740]   I think it's technically still in beta, but it doesn't seem to do anything too terribly
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.740]   nasty to your system.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.600]   I mean, I turned it off to do this podcast because I didn't want it to be trying to upload
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.240]   while we were doing it, but you've got configuration control over that sort of stuff.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   And the thing I really like about it is that it's not throttled.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.680]   Mosey, if anybody's used that, has a limit that they impose for how much it throttles
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.320]   it, it's pretty low.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.240]   So when I sat down to do my initial backup on something like Mosey, it took weeks to
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.600]   get actually things in the cloud.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   I mean, literally.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.040]   I think that's sort of how they controlled it.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.640]   Whereas on backplays, they don't enforce that on you.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:21.040]   And so I uploaded 20 gigabytes in the matter of a day getting up to the cloud.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   So that was nice.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.200]   And it's kind of time machine in the sense that time machine like in the sense that it
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.480]   has a history there.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:34.440]   So you can say, download this file from a week ago as opposed to just whatever you have up
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   there right now.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440]   It looks limited, though.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.560]   I think it only goes back like a month or so.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.640]   What's the storage limit?
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   What's that?
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.880]   What's the storage limit?
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.440]   Is there how many years?
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:50.160]   So for the-- it's $5 a month, $5 per computer per month, but it's unlimited storage then.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.800]   So like I said, I put 20 to 30 gigs from my laptop up there.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.840]   I'm going to look into then back at my full library at some point, my full photo library
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.640]   of a few hundred gigs just to see how it does it.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.440]   The only limitation is that it just takes a while for it to get up there.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   Great.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.080]   Well, that's-- so what's the aim of that again?
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.080]   So it's backblaze, www.backblaze, B-A-C-K-B-L-A-Z-E.com.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.680]   So for-- I'm really liking it.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680]   It is beta.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.280]   I made-- hated after another few weeks and things started breaking.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.920]   But at this point, it's well designed.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.000]   It seems really well thought out.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.520]   And it's just that extra level of comfort of even if your house burns down and all your
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.320]   backup just go with it, you still have something that is out in the cloud somewhere.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   Yeah, very good.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320]   And they have really strong encryption.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.060]   So you're going to actually put in your own encryption key so they don't know what
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   it's in there.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.060]   Everything gets encrypted before it's sent up to their server.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.140]   So it's encrypted locally and then sent over to their backups.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   It's fantastic.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.560]   Hey, Ron, where can people find you?
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:07:00.540]   You can of course find myself as well as Fred and the-- this week in photography podcast.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.020]   People should come check that out, of course.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:09.700]   Twittering is Ron Brinkman, R-O-N-B-R-I-N-K-M-A-N-N, two Ns at the end.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.700]   And digitalcomposting.com is my blog.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.700]   Very good.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.340]   Andy, where's the best point right now?
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.740]   We'll find you.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.540]   In the human heart.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.540]   That was a given.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.700]   There you go.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   It's Christmas.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:35.140]   Which means that I haven't snocked it on rum since Tuesday.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:42.420]   The celestial waste of bandwidth is the place where I make my own personal nexus at cwob.com.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:08:02.300]   Technically, it's an
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.180]   all-around-the-end.com.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:11.020]   And as Ron mentioned, we're also hanging out on Twitter every week.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.620]   So that's a good place to catch up with us.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.620]   Fantastic.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:23.260]   Until next week, another Mac break is broke.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.620]   Hello, everyone.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:32.620]   I'm not going to start with "Hello, everyone."
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.220]   It's your trademark.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   I know.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.220]   I know.
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.220]   All right.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.220]   Hi, I'm an appie.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.220]   Go, go, go.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   I'll set up a couple.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   [laughter]
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.220]   [music]
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.220]   [music]
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.800]   (upbeat music)
