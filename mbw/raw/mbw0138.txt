[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all things
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Macintosh like that new Macintosh tablet.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Isn't that exciting ladies and gentlemen?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   The new Macintosh Mini, the little computer that you just can't stop.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And a whole lot more with us today from his laboratory
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   in beautiful Massachusetts where he is in fact testing
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   all the new Verizon iPhones and a fine kosher cola.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Mr. Annie, not cola.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Is that kosher?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I'm not allowed to comment on the contents of this class.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It might contain a new multiprocessor tablet Macintosh.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It might not.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Part of the deal that I made while agreeing or not agreeing
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   to previous technology meant that I can never comment on it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But thank you Leo, good try.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I mean good try.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I tried.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Well, I sometimes if you sneak up on one just right,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   you'll forget that in the year.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Also, your ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Picsacore.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I very much enjoy kosher pickles.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   How was NAB?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   NAB was very, it's actually a lot of fun.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   There was a lot of great, small, usually what happens
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   you go to NAB and there's...
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   NAB is the National Association of Broadcasters.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And there's a number of NAB.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I was at NAB radio a few months ago.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   This is the NAB...
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   For TV.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   For engineers though really, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Well, it really has become, I think it started out that way.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But really it's become this thing that is for people in New York.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   For people in New media.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   In fact, the busiest haul, it used to be audio.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You know, audio used to be the busy haul.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Right.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Long ago.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Then the middle where they did lots of production unit.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You know, the big lights and everything else was the busy haul.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And now it's really what they call the South Hall.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it is the, that is where all the media and software
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and all these other things are there.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And it's, you know, and you'll see everything from new mixers to
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   new mixers from like Samson that are really cool that are like
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   $399 to 8K projections of film.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Or not film, it's like its own projector.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Which is so sharp it actually hurts your eyes.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Wait, 8K is too old.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   8,000 pixels wide.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So we're right now at 2K.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's high def.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   People have been talking about the Red Former, which is 4K.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That's quadruple.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So the Japanese, yeah.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And the Japanese company that has an 8K projector.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   8K.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And you know what's interesting is that I didn't...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Is life even 8K?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I think that's higher resolution than actual living.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   All I know is that I left with my eyes were actually sore.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It was so much detail.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And I think that it's because when we look at stuff in the world...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I think it's hyper.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That's hyper real.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It was hyper real.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And it's a huge screen.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It wasn't like a little screen.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It was a huge wall.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But you see, anyway, you see the whole range.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Who's doing that?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Japanese coming?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's Japanese coming.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'll find it.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Boy, that would.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And did you think that that's going to get traction?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You know, it's probably 10 years away.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We need new cameras.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   How do they even shoot that?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Well, they have their own cameras.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Well, I mean, Red is going to come out with cameras that are higher than 8K.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Really?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah, they have a...
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Red has a sensor that's supposed to be out next year that has 28,000 by 9,000 high.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So, you know, I mean, really, one of the...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Obviously, entertainment is one big application for this.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The movie theaters have to get some way to get you back in the theater.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Or an event location, you know, that type of thing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.840]   But imagine if you had a wall with that kind of resolution, it would be telepresence.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.920]   The other side of that wall was an 8K camera in your cousin's house in Texas.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   And you're in California and you're saying hi to them.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   They're like, they're there.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.360]   Yeah, and a lot of their technology is actually, I believe, using multiple sensors.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   So what they're doing is they're blending multiple...
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   So you have a whole bunch of 2K sensors that blend into one big or 4K sensors that blend
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.920]   into one large, very, very large image.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   And it was funny, they were showing standard depth and then they were showing HD.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.920]   And HD is still like this small square on the screen.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   You know, it was like, this is what we're showing you now.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   And so anyway, but there's a lot of...
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   You know, the Mac was actually very well represented there.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   I mean, you're seeing a lot of companies that have been traditionally PC, like Autodesk announcing
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   new products like Mudbox that have been only PC on the Mac.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   And so it's interesting to see these companies starting to pay a lot of attention to that.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   And we shot...
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   I think we shot 25 episodes for Mac Break Video from the world.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   So that's...
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   Are those up yet?
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   They're all going up.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   They're half up now.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   So there's probably, I think there's 12 or so 9 or 12.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   We're putting up about three a day until we're finished.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   It'll probably be at the end of this week.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   It was taken...
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   We learned not to put them all up.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.920]   Yeah, yeah, it's overwhelming.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   Well, it's mostly cash-fly calls and says, please stop.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   So yeah.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   So, but we covered a lot of stuff on the floor.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   So people suggested...
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   That means people try to download all of them all at once.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   And then...
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   Yeah, I was about to say, Alex, you basically launch a denial of service attack on anyone
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   who's stupid enough to post your content.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   Because if you're the popularity and the size, it's like...
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   Wow.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Yeah, so it's...
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   But we've slowed it down and it actually works out well for people who are...
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   You know, you get three a day and you can kind of just see what we found interesting anyway.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   And it was Apple there at all?
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   Apple definitely had a presence there.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   It did not have a booth.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   But they were part of the...
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.920]   A.J.A. had announced a new Apple ProRes recorder that you can actually plug straight into almost any camera out there.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   So you can get...
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   You can just record straight to Apple ProRes and then immediately drop it into Final Cut.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   And so the product manager for Apple was there talking about that.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   You saw him in a lot of...
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   You saw a lot of Apple products and Apple announcements integrated with stuff that was happening in any of me.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   But they didn't...
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   You know, the booths are incredibly expensive.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   When you look at the size of these booths and you calculate flights, hotels for everyone, you're talking millions of dollars.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   And so I think more and more companies are rethinking that process.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   Andy, any questions for Alex about any of you anything you wanted to know about?
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   I have tons, but I don't have to do it on this show because a lot of it's about mixing.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   There's a lot of it's about mixers and stuff like that.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   There's a mixer there with 16 inputs with my name on it.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   Well, it's not shipping.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   This is for Leo.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   Yeah, Data Video has a 3000.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   That's the one that was alluding to.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   That's a hardware mixer that will do that.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   But how much?
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   We're talking video switch.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   Yeah, they didn't have a price yet either.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   So it's probably...
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   Well, it's probably 20,000 for the mixer or something in that ballpark.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   In that ballpark, 25,000.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   I know NewTek was there.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   They showed their TriCaster HD.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   HD.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   Yeah, and I'm still very happy.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   I don't really feel a huge need to switch.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   Right.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   And then I'm also looking at those new Axia audio boards from Telos.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   Were they there?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   Did they show it?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   You know, Telos was there and I have to admit I didn't...
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   I kind of...
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   Yeah, you need to because you're going to be wiring our studio.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   With the Axia board any day now.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   Yes.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   Anything you'd like to ask?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   X, Mr....
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   Just like when you're talking about getting these 8K digital images, how much of this is just
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.400]   for people who need to produce at a higher resolution than the display resolution of your
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.920]   audience and how much of this is really something that people are really going to be able to
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   understand.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   I saw...
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.520]   I was at the Ebertfest, Roger Ebert's Film Festival last week and I saw CETA sings the
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.840]   blues in HD cam on a screen the size of a volleyball court and it looked like just the
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.920]   most intensely silk-strained painted murals in motion.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   And I can't imagine anything possibly being even better than that.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   That's the most challenging thing I've ever seen.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   So simple stark geometric shapes that have absolutely no betrayal of their original digital
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   source.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   Well, I think that...
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   I think this is the issue.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   I mean, I'm not a big...
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   I mean, I think the 8K was something we had to see everyone says, "Oh, you got to..."
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   You know, we went over to see it.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   I wasn't left with something...
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   I wasn't left with feeling like I needed to have that kind of resolution.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   You know, I think that, you know, when we look at just going to digital projection which
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:01.680]   doesn't have any...the images in bouncing anymore, you know, when it was recorded or when it was...
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.200]   That makes it sharper by itself.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.520]   The resolution is higher than what we've grown up with with film.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.800]   Now, people will tell you that the big thing is that...
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.960]   And I can see possibly, if you're going to standardize on something, standardizing on
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:20.440]   a 4K projector gives you some future growth, allows you to have us even sharper image.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.120]   And so that's fine.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.760]   But I don't think that anything more than 4K would really make sense.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.720]   And I'm hard pressed to say that even 4K would really...
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.120]   I don't want to be a Luddite, but 2K is...
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   Oh, you're so old-fashioned.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   2K is really enough.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   2K is plenty.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   It's so 640K memory.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.240]   Come on, Alex Lindsey of all people.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.720]   I would have thought you of all people would have wanted 4K.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.560]   You know, I have Joe Shamish, who was with us on the Tasmanian adventure, Lightroom adventure.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.360]   He's a photographer, he shoots Tasmania.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.440]   He got a red camera.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.520]   He said, "I know, I now know I can play this, but I'm going to shoot everything.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   Because I don't know how much longer this wilderness is going to be here.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.560]   And I want to shoot it in 4K.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.960]   And I'm sure if you get an 8K camera, he'd shoot an 8K camera."
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.560]   Well, and when you look at future use.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   Exactly.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.240]   And the other thing that you get when you're shooting it, it's a whole different world because
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.920]   this new red that's going to come out sometime next year, at 28,000 by 9,000.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.120]   What you really have is if you ever saw that fight at Kruger Park, with the Wilderbeast
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.040]   and everything else, you could just shoot that without moving the camera.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   You could just have it locked up.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.640]   And then be zooming in the different areas and pulling back.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.320]   And those are one of the reasons you might want to acquire it.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.720]   But as far as projection goes, I think that it's, you know, I think this is one of the
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.560]   things that, you know, if we got to 8K, let's say, or 4K and we shot 60 frames a second,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   it would look like a window.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.680]   You know, because our eye refreshes about 60 frames a second.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   It's too good.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.920]   And that, and Roger, you really want that is what you're saying.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.200]   Yeah, watching a film is an experience.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.920]   Artistically, there's an experience that you get that I'm watching a film that is part
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   of the process, maybe for a ride.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   You know, what a thing.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   I'm looking through a window at these people.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.640]   Well, you know, when they first, in the early film, they were, they had a, they were
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   running out of the air.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.280]   They would be coming out of them and they go, "Ah!"
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   Right.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.080]   So, I mean, that would happen again, but we got used to it, Alex.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   We did.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   We did.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080]   We did.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.080]   We used to.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.620]   a long way away because on top of having--
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.340]   - Were there holograms there?
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.260]   - There were, I didn't look at too many of them.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.720]   There was some 3D, there was a lot of 3D,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.280]   what they're really trying, three D is a big deal,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.140]   of course, everyone's paying attention to 3D.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.520]   One of the things that is kind of on that bleeding edge
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.620]   right now is people trying to make screens
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.680]   that don't require glasses that you can look at.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   And it's still very, in its early stages, shall we say.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.700]   But it's interesting.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.580]   - Wouldn't such a screen have to always have 3D content,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.160]   otherwise it would look really strange?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.920]   - Well no, it just looks, more of what happens
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.500]   is it just doesn't look like anything's happening
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.320]   half the time.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.040]   It didn't, it didn't really, and I have to admit,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.080]   the first film that I went to that I really felt like
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.960]   was a good 3D film was Monsters and Aliens,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.560]   it took my kids to Monsters and Aliens,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.480]   and that actually was a great--
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.320]   - That's what I'm hearing is that
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   because it was all digital, it was all digital,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.220]   they were able to render it perfectly in those areas,
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.060]   it was actually-- - Not optically,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.160]   it's done digital. - I hear Corlin was really good too.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.920]   I didn't see that in 3D. - I get all digital right now.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.240]   Those are the ones that are easiest to convert
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.140]   because you can just put two virtual cameras up there
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.180]   and say render, you know.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.340]   So anyway, NAB was great.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.340]   If people wanna see more, they can go to Macbreak Video.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.660]   - Cool.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.500]   I got an interesting email from a guy who says,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.660]   "Just so you know, Kevin Rose doesn't get all the good leaks.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.700]   This is a fellow who is an insider at Verizon,
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.140]   I verified his identity.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.400]   He knows wherever he speaks, he has actual hands on.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.760]   He says, "I can confirm we are in talks
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   to launch an Apple phone in the 2010-2011 timeframe.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.960]   It's down to both Verizon and Apple at this point,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.400]   so they're negotiating about that."
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.280]   Apparently also talking about integrating into laptops,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   which could be, you know, a Mac mini of some kind.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.360]   - Right.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.560]   - He doesn't say anything about that specifically.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.960]   - And he's now fired.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.380]   - Yeah, well, that's pretty, that's the rumor
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.960]   that everybody has, but this is a guy from something.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.800]   - He's just saying yes.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.100]   - I'm confirming this rumor from somebody
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.200]   who I know knows what he's talking about.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.040]   - Great.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.400]   - Well, okay, but it's a rumor
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.760]   that's pretty much devoid of content.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.000]   I mean, I was in talks to write a movie
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.400]   for Sony DreamWorks a few years ago.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.240]   - It's true.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.000]   - It's one thing to have a meeting and talk about.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.880]   It's another thing to actually have a deal,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.120]   an actual promise to actually make stuff.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.320]   I think Apple is gonna be talking to every single wireless
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.960]   carrier to see if they can kind of better deal
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.800]   with everybody else than they can with IT&T.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.640]   'Cause that's just smart.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.480]   - Yeah.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.300]   - Yeah.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.140]   - That's what you do at the end of any contract.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.520]   - But I guess in a way, maybe it's the negative
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320]   of the rumor, which is, yeah, they're in conversations.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.600]   No, there's nothing been decided.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   - Right.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.280]   - And it's still 2010.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.080]   - It is not till next year at the earliest,
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.280]   maybe even 2011.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.120]   - Exactly.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   - Right. - Exactly.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.680]   So in that sense, I guess it's confirming somewhat
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.360]   the rumors we've heard, but saying it's not, definitely.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.320]   - Well, and there's so many of us that would love to see it
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   only because Verizon coverage is so much better than AT&T.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.200]   - Everybody, everybody says, and we said this last week,
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   you weren't here, Alex, but we were talking about Tim Cook.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.680]   I think that was, was it on this show that we were talking
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.640]   about Tim Cook saying in the Apple analyst call,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.540]   there's no way we'd make a net book.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.800]   They're too crappy.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.240]   They're just, they're junkie.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.440]   I think maybe it was on Twitch.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.640]   I was saying this, and everybody said,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.600]   oh, that definitely means they're shipping one.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   - That's the Steve Jobs technique.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.040]   - We don't know that.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.000]   - That's the Bill Gates technique thing.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680]   We don't believe that this market is mature enough
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.800]   to support a graphical user interface.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.400]   We're monitoring it carefully and we will be shipping
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.280]   Windows in four months time, but we really don't believe
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.760]   that the at this is a market that makes sense for us.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.600]   We might be shipping four months late.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.920]   It's gonna be a little bit buggy.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.280]   There's gonna be some slippage.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.920]   - Well then Jobs took a page from the Gates notebook.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.720]   Remember when he said, oh, nobody wants to watch video
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.280]   on a little device, like an iPod.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.240]   So I mean, yeah, this is, do you think that Tim Cook's saying,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   no, net books are too crappy for us to make?
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   - I don't think, I don't think he's gonna make a net book.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.960]   I really don't think that Apple's gonna make a small,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.520]   a smaller version of a computer.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.080]   I think that, I think we're really gonna see a tablet.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.920]   - Yeah.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.640]   And the rumors are the tablet is gonna be somewhat,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.360]   they got 10 inch screens, but it'd be somewhat smaller.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.000]   We'll not have a keyboard, right?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.840]   - Right.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.720]   - Somewhat smaller than a net book,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.280]   but obviously bigger than an iPhone.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.040]   - The simple thing to keep in mind is that
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.360]   Apple never kept its promise to stay out of the smartphone
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.000]   market because they created an iPhone, not a smartphone.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.520]   They created something that was sort of like, exactly.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.880]   And that's exactly the sort of thing they're gonna be doing
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.720]   with net books.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.640]   They're gonna create a device that definitely directly
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.840]   competes with net books, but you couldn't really call it
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.680]   a net book.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.600]   You can see that they're taking advantage of the marketplace
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.920]   that was already there, but they're not gonna, again,
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.760]   I definitely agree with you that they're not gonna make
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.200]   a $400 device that has all the sacrifices you have to make
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.880]   in order to make a $400 notebook.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   - And here's the worst part is I think they're gonna sell
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.000]   it for $800 and they're gonna crush the market.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.840]   (laughs)
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.360]   I mean, that's the thing is that they think,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.760]   'cause it's gonna do a lot more.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.800]   I mean, I think that we're on this verge of when you look
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.040]   at the 3.0 software, I think you're looking at companies
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   starting to just use whatever Apple makes either the iPhone
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.920]   or this larger tablet as the interface device
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.720]   for their other applications.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   Right now, I would love to be able to take a media tablet
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.320]   or my iPhone and just pop it into my CRX,
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.160]   you know, my car, instead of having the crappy interface
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.280]   that they built for.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.120]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.840]   Have a little hole in the dash for it.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.680]   - Exactly, just give me the little thing.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.520]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   - That becomes your total one thing.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.760]   And maybe even you get home and you plug it into your dock
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.800]   and that's your computer.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.520]   - And when you see what they're doing with, like,
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.720]   for instance, the heart, the blood pressure monitors,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.040]   you know, when they were showing that that's the sharp end
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.480]   of this little stick is that suddenly everybody starts
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.320]   just saying, well, we'll build something for the iPhone
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.480]   so that I can pop my iPhone in, whether it's medical
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.120]   or military or educational or all these things
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.720]   by allowing it to be tethered, by allowing it to have
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.920]   more features there and having a lot of people have it,
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   you end up just letting them use that as the interface
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.200]   because it's so much better than the crap that they're
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.800]   creating now for, you know, by everyone's reinventing
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   the wheel and Apple does it better than they do.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.640]   - Right.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.040]   - Yeah, that's kind of a scary challenge for Apple though
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.280]   because if you're telling people if they have to buy $200
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.160]   thing to get the same sort of functionality that people
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.280]   got standard with their cars two years ago,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.720]   that's a little bit of a hard sell.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.960]   It works great for Apple if they can simply use it
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.880]   to justify buying our media player and our phone
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.560]   instead of anybody else's.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.040]   But I was one who was saying that I really want to be able
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.880]   to basically dock my iPhone inside my bread machine,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.680]   launch an application that lets this microprocessor
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.960]   and lets this interface set up a really complicated program
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.160]   so I get cinnamon buns without having to turn things
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.280]   on and off again three, four times.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.480]   But the day when we start building appliances that need
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.160]   a $200 accessory to do anything at all,
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.480]   youch, that's a really big phase shift.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.680]   I would more look forward to an industry standard
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.320]   dock connector so that any device can exploit any touch
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.600]   screen and basically load any sort of software onto it
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.200]   then believe that any whole industry is gonna back
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.800]   the iPhone or the iPod for that.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.280]   - One thing I might also add by the way to that rumor
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.040]   that I said is that the network that they're talking
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.400]   about this for is not the CDMA network but Verizon has
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.080]   something called LTE which stands for long-term evolution.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.720]   This is easy.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.320]   - Wait a minute here, how sexy?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.480]   100 megabits down, 50 megabits up.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.080]   (laughing)
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.240]   - So really they're talking about putting it on a data network
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.080]   which might confirm everything we've just said
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.760]   that it really isn't necessarily a phone device per se.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.560]   - Well once you get to 100 megabits a second,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.400]   who needs a phone?
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.360]   - Well, you know, it's something that Verizon's interest
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.160]   though, I mean they're a phone company.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.440]   - I don't know, I think that some people maybe starting
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   to realize that they're gonna be a pipe.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.200]   - You know, they wanna stay that way but I think that--
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.240]   - Verizon, looking at what they've done with Fios
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.760]   is really up in the ante.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.600]   They're putting their money with it.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.640]   I mean it's expensive to implement Fios.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.440]   And I remember John C. de Vorex said,
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.360]   "Ah, it's a publicity stunt, they'll do it in one city,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200]   two cities I'll never do."
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.640]   And they're rolling it out everywhere.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.040]   They really are committed to what is a very expensive gamble.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.960]   And LTE is somewhat like that.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.320]   They're talking in the next couple of years.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.440]   - I mean if you can get someone to pay you $150 a month
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.160]   to have your high speed internet access,
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.280]   why do you need them to pay more for a cell phone?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.120]   - That's right.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.800]   I mean the thing, the idea is that they get the money
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.760]   from you either way and someone like me would be happy
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.400]   to pay $150 a month to have that kind of speed.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.640]   - The issue is really these old line companies
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.800]   like Time Warner and Comcast who are saying,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.880]   "Well now we need to sell premium content
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   to justify our infrastructure."
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.720]   A company like Verizon comes along and says,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.320]   if they say this in a very forward thinking way,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.400]   we're satisfied, we'll sell it for a premium cost
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.560]   for the data but we'll let you do anything you want with it.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.240]   That would give you a competitive advantage
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.840]   and it would solve this net neutrality issue.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.800]   I mean what Time Warner is doing with caps
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   and then go back and forth on this.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.880]   Yeah, is really anti-competitive.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.520]   I mean they're really saying,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.240]   "Well use our broadband but don't download any movies
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.560]   'cause we want to sell you those on the cable."
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.240]   If Verizon were to say, "Now data's data."
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.120]   - Well I mean the only reason we chose Comcast here
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.680]   was because there weren't any other fast options.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.520]   There's no competition.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.880]   As soon as Verizon came in with Fios and no cap,
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.240]   I would, we would move over.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.120]   - Yeah.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.560]   So we're talking, this is essentially
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.400]   the fourth generation network.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.160]   Capable absolutely of carrying voice,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.120]   carrying video, carrying the same kind of video
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.520]   that we're doing right now on every one of your calls.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.440]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.880]   I'd be very excited.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.160]   So maybe that does kind of in a way,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.320]   back hand away, confirm this tablet.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   - Right, I mean you don't need--
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.640]   - The tablet always makes sense.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   Just from the point of view that it supports and enhances
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.680]   every single other product and service that Apple makes.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.760]   It certainly is the ultimate device for HD content.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.560]   It certainly gives them a new bookmark
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.840]   and it certainly amplifies their apps market.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.040]   And if you try to project back to my Mac onto a tablet,
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.400]   find a way to articulate it into a touch display,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.200]   suddenly the Mac becomes the hottest operating system
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.720]   you can possibly have because it's not just,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.680]   it's not just that big powerful desktop you have.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.720]   It's this tiny little or this pocketable device
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   that can project everything that you've got back at home
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.120]   into your jacket pocket.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.760]   I mean, it is again a perfect Apple type device.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.040]   - Are we wishful thinking or are we actually strategizing?
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   - I think we're starting to move past the wishful thinking.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.880]   - Yeah.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.680]   - It plays MP3s and Audible content.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.520]   Yes, bonus!
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.600]   (laughing)
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.040]   - Well, as somebody pointed out in our Twitter,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.440]   though, that said the T word, in our Twitter conversations room
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.960]   on Friend Feed, this is the media tablet,
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.120]   this is Todd's talking, is a perfect position
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.920]   for an Apple tablet because with iTunes Store,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.840]   it's perfect for doing to print what they did for music.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.960]   It puts them in a position to do print, music, video,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.120]   all through the iTunes Store.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.400]   It fits perfectly with Apple's business model.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   - Yeah.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.760]   - They need a partner on high speed,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.560]   a fourth generation cell network.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.240]   - If I had that device was out now
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.200]   and I could hook a Bluetooth keyboard to it.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.040]   You know, if I had like a little like a little role,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.080]   like rubbery one or whatever, I can carry with me,
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.200]   I would definitely be going to conferences like last week.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.480]   I would definitely just go with that.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.440]   I wouldn't be taking my laptop.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.280]   You know, it's just a pandemic.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   - We have a visitor, Randy's in the studio
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.040]   watching the show from Florida.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.880]   - He's so cute.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.680]   - With an Asus EPC running.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.000]   - It's got a little Mac on it.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.920]   It's got a little Apple.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.880]   - It's got a look at it.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.240]   I mean, let's actually let's show this
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.560]   'cause it's very cool.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360]   He's modded the case so that it,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.720]   instead of having, I don't know, is this Asus put a thing in?
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.280]   It's got an Apple on it.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.080]   - There's a guy who's making Apple stickers
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.640]   that are designed to fit specifically over like Asus logos
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.880]   and the Hackintosh logos.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.600]   That is like, you know what?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.240]   You need to fix this Acer.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.520]   It says Acer right here though.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   You gotta fix that.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.960]   But, I mean, he's on a cellular network.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.200]   He's using a cellular network.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   We could get you online for real if you want.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.160]   That's the wifi ID.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   And he's running a Macintosh.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.560]   I mean, he's done it for himself.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.360]   Combled it together proves there's a market for it, I think.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   You know?
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.760]   - When I said, I don't need to have Randy's last name.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.920]   And we don't know where he's from
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   and those are his fingers but we'll never show his face.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.680]   So there you go.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.600]   - And I don't have the need.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.560]   There is a large, a growing portion of my life
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.720]   where I don't need a keyboard.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.960]   You know where I'm happy to kind of--
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.280]   - Well that's the real question.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.520]   Are you think, are you really you think
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.360]   that you could do without a keyboard?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.080]   - Well no, no, I'd say I wouldn't,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.800]   I don't need a keyboard all the time.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.080]   Well what I would, I would be happy
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   with a touchscreen keyboard about 30% of the time.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.720]   No keyboard, no the 30% of the time.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.160]   And then, you know, I have to write articles
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.240]   and I have to actually input data.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.000]   And so then I need another, you know,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.320]   for 40% of the time I would need a,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.360]   but I wouldn't, I'd love to have the idea
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   that I could go out somewhere
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.880]   and not have to take the keyboard.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.280]   You know, I just have my interface
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.400]   that I can get along with for right now.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.000]   But not having a keyboard at all is a little bit of a pain
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.160]   but I think that we'll see third party developers
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.400]   with the tethering and everything else.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.600]   We're gonna see third party developers
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   making that stuff available.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.120]   - My same source, this isn't really Apple news
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.600]   but you might like this at Verizon says,
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.840]   they've got a device coming.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.440]   He's used it called the MyFi.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.000]   It's an EVDO, basically Wi-Fi access point
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.120]   about the size of a credit card.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.000]   So it has some battery can go for six hours of time.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.320]   He says, that's how long I've used it.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.200]   This is not marketing hype.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000]   This is actually how long I've used it.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.520]   You don't need device drivers or software.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.960]   You just put it on your table,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.360]   you turn it on and you have an access point.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.560]   - Wow.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.280]   - You know, I use the cradle point router to do that
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.640]   but this is a lot smaller.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.080]   I really think that we're really entering this age
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.600]   of universal high speed access over 3G and soon to be,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.040]   I think fourth G networks.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.360]   Mike in our friend feed room says,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.160]   a tablet is a hobby just like the Apple TV.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.960]   - He says you're a hobbyist, Alex Lindsey.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.720]   - Well, I think that the iPhone's a hobby.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.560]   I mean, I don't think that,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.400]   I don't think it's gonna go anywhere.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.840]   I think that, you know, no one's gonna buy any,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.040]   no one's gonna buy music on a phone.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.120]   - Never have a number one.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.080]   - Number two is if you start putting applications on it
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.440]   without a keyboard, no one's ever gonna download any of those.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.680]   - Well, we know, 'cause the Apple results came out
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.040]   for the quarter that this is the best Q2 they've ever had
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.720]   and it's not 'cause of Mac sales.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.280]   Computer sales were down 12%,
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.080]   it was because of iPhone sales.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.280]   A huge quarter for the iPhone.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.560]   - I think it was 1.6, was it?
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.760]   - It's like that 1.6 million iPhones.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.840]   - 11 million iPods.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.320]   It's a, you know--
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.160]   - I bought two.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   - 3.79 million iPhones.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.480]   - 3.3 and 3/4 million iPhones.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.600]   - I bought three iPhones and two iPods
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   over the last quarter or so.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.680]   - That's doubled the number year to year.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.280]   They doubled the number.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.320]   It's really, this 3G has been a huge success
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.120]   compared to the first generation iPhone.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.400]   - Yeah.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.700]   - But Mac sales down for the first time in six years.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.080]   So it's, you know, it shows really the robustness
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.120]   of Apple's business plan that even though they weren't able
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.120]   to sell computers, which a lot of people expected
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.480]   at some point because of the economy,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.920]   they're still selling these iPods and iPhones
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.320]   in huge numbers.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.640]   It's a multi-pronged attack.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.080]   - The only scary thing from a professional point of view
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.280]   is hoping that Apple doesn't lose focus
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.360]   on continuing to improve the pro line and continuing to,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.880]   you know, that's the thing you always worry about
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.480]   when you see following numbers.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.920]   - The other rumor, and you can see this on Macrovers.com.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.720]   Arnold Kim's great site is iPhone Lite.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.040]   We've seen this a couple of times too.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   So a cheap, reduced functionality iPhone in June.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.800]   Perhaps a tablet announcement in June.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.840]   You think they can have the tablet ready in June?
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.360]   - Oh yeah, I do.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   I would like that 'cause my iPhone's home--
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.080]   - I still think you'd wanna show it at WWDC
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.920]   because you'd wanna spend WWDC talking
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.000]   about how to build applications for it.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   That's why I still think that that makes sense.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.120]   - According to--
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.240]   - It would never be introduced before the holiday season.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.360]   It would be introduced in September.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   It would not be introduced over the summer.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.400]   - The on-outs in June.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   - Announcing June, no.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.800]   - The show developers in June and ship in September.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.640]   - Yeah, September on-
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.480]   - That seems reasonable.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.640]   According to Business Week,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.680]   two people familiar with the subject say
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.120]   the Apple MediaPad will be slightly smaller
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.160]   than Amazon's Kindle.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.520]   Its touchscreen will be bigger than the Kindle's screen.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.200]   A lot of the Kindle's taken up with that keyboard
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   and a pretty big bezel for the buttons.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.600]   The media, the media pad category might go to Verizon.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.720]   So the person who's seen this device,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.600]   we're talking about a device where people will say,
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.920]   "Dang, why didn't we do this?"
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.520]   Apple's gonna define the whole category.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.000]   And then an iPhone Lite, not from Verizon.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.880]   - This is for the media tablet and Apple.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.720]   - That's the best.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.560]   - Well, I don't think they're gonna do it
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.280]   for a deal with Verizon for this year.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.120]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.640]   - I don't think that's possible.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.360]   And in my source in Verizon says no.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.600]   Also, it would have to be a switchover
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.960]   for the entire iPhone line.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.680]   I can't imagine Apple having its consumers
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.480]   signed one two year contract for a phone
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.400]   and another two year contract for a media tablet.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240]   - Yeah.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.880]   - Rather with the second company.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   Now did you see, and I don't know if I give this much credit,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.040]   the unofficial Apple web blog,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.400]   they're looking at Addium stats.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   And Addium reports the name of the computer
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.440]   that it's been used with.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.320]   The last time this happened,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   MacBook Air showed up in these stats,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.040]   just a few people using a MacBook Air.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.200]   Nobody had ever heard of it at the time,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.320]   and sure enough, out comes the MacBook Air.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.320]   Now, MacBook Mini found in the Addium stats.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.200]   Just one of them.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.760]   In between the MT and the NX, whatever those are,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.600]   Portage R and Lenovo Y, a MacBook Mini, capital M,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.680]   capital B, capital M.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.480]   Of course it could be, you know, it's easy enough to spoof this.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.560]   - Yeah, and I'm doing this search right now to look at it.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.520]   I know one of the last steps in building a hack and tosses
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.160]   to, some people are even unsatisfied about the hack,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   not saying what kind of processor has, what kind of it is,
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.400]   so you can basically slug in whatever you wanted to be.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.080]   - I don't know, now I know you can do that very easily
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.880]   with a browser, I don't know how you do with Addium,
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.720]   the chat client.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.160]   You might, I might take a little bit more of a hack,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.600]   but it's probably not a terribly difficult hack.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.920]   Just change some resource strings, I would guess.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.800]   So take that with a grain of salt.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   I know I do.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.440]   I'm firing up Addium though, just to see if I can change
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.000]   my into MacBook Maxi.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.360]   - Just join a group and say, does anybody have a MacBook Mini?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.680]   Can I see a picture of it?
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.400]   (laughing)
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.320]   Who knows, maybe they're not quite as smart as I am
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   to your Jedi mind tricks.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.800]   - We know this much, that is for sure.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.680]   What else are we gonna talk about here today?
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.760]   Scott Borne by the way, I should mention is not with us today.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.160]   He's, I think he mentioned last week he's on a,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.920]   he's on a assignment, isn't that what they always say?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.560]   - Someplace fabulous taking pictures of things
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.960]   that are incredible, that's got bore.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.720]   - Wonderful fiery items.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.440]   - So Amazon bought a,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.960]   - Stanza. - Stanza.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.680]   - What do you think about that?
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.800]   - You know, I think that when we look at companies
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.840]   being able to sell directly to their applications,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.640]   I think it's a very interesting thing to do.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.760]   I mean, when you look at 3.0, you could theoretically,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.360]   Amazon wouldn't need, they could give you Stanza
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.240]   and then sell you content.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.520]   Stanza's the, these are both iPhone,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.720]   applique both, I mean, we're talking about the Amazon,
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.800]   Kindle iPhone application and the Stanza application
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.640]   for the iPhone.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.880]   Does Stanza only Gutenberg and public domain stuff
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.040]   or can you buy stuff on the Stanza?
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.600]   - You can also buy e-reader.com content.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.920]   So it also supports DRM.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.240]   So that's kind of interesting twist
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.120]   because I don't think Amazon is a sort of company
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.320]   that would simply take this private,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.520]   delete features from it and turn it into an Amazon Kindle
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.280]   only DRM reader.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.360]   And they've put the folks at the,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.200]   the folks behind Stanza have already posted saying,
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.040]   "Hey, we don't foresee any big changes in the future."
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   If they can only, if the big thing that happens
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.320]   is that Amazon's Kindle reader for the iPhone
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.800]   turns into a half as kick butt an application as Stanza,
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.640]   then that's pretty good.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.800]   If it turns out though, that our best standalone
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.320]   ePub supporting reader on the iPhone
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.600]   suddenly becomes proprietary
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.360]   and suddenly doesn't do everything that it used to do.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.720]   That's really awful news.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.600]   - Amazon gets a big evil sticker.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.560]   - Yeah, I mean, Stanza is not just a book reader for me.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.240]   It's the standard app I use whenever I have a document
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.640]   on my Mac that I want to put on my iPhone
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.160]   because the reader portion of it is just absolutely perfect.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.560]   It's absolutely everything that I want.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.960]   - It is better than the Kindle, that's for sure.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.000]   - Yeah, well, Kindle is just very, very basic.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.800]   It doesn't let you do a whole lot.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.560]   Including, including getting more content.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.560]   - Right.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.400]   - Right.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.720]   - Well, yeah, you have to buy it on your Kindle
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.080]   don't you, or buy it on Amazon.com?
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.600]   - Yeah, well, if you buy it,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.480]   it only download stuff that you've already purchased.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.680]   So you would have to go to your desktop browser,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   make a purchase via that browser,
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.520]   and then say, oh, please deliver this to my iPhone.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.120]   And then, or just set up a sync between it.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.760]   But you can't simply be in an airport waiting area,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.920]   have 50 minutes to realize that,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.200]   oh my God, I just finished this book
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.760]   and that would last me this entire flight
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.040]   and find something new to read.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.200]   Where else would Stanza, whatever you want?
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.600]   - So they're, what do they do?
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.560]   Do they keep Stanza alive as a standalone application
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.440]   and add the capability to read Kindle books on it?
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.320]   Or do they make this be the Kindle app?
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.960]   Or my guess is that the Kindle app is gonna be history.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.680]   My guess is that they're going to,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   I know that Stanza was, at least as of five or six months ago
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.200]   was trying, was thinking about whether they want to get
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.760]   into the business of building book readers
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.880]   for other publishers.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.680]   So that if I wanted to create an e-book
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.360]   that I wanted to sell to the iTunes store,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.720]   but I could license their technology
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.040]   or at least use them as a publisher.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.800]   I send them the manuscript formatted
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.000]   and they put it on the iTunes store and give me a try of it.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.360]   - Oh interesting, oh interesting.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.600]   - But I also know that they consider that
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.280]   and ultimately decided that that wasn't the business
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.760]   that they wanted to get into.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.960]   So it's possible that they want to be the technology
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.280]   that drives other people's products instead of anything else.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.960]   I really do feel that we're still gonna have
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.360]   a standalone Stanza reader
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   and now we're gonna have also the Amazon Kindle application.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.680]   Option three, and this is more of a Google thing
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.640]   than an Amazon solution I think,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.920]   would be to simply keep Stanza the way it is
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.360]   and simply add absolutely exhaustive support
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.480]   for the Kindle store.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.880]   So that would essentially do a really great job
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.960]   of trumping all other competition
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.440]   in the iPhone book reader space.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.760]   So it would be such a dominating application
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.880]   for book reading that.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.960]   Anybody else who tries to enter this market
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.560]   would have to start with a question,
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   why should I use your product instead of the Stanza-on?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.120]   - Right, right.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.400]   I have to say, I haven't used Stanza in a while.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.600]   It was a little primitive when I first tried it
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.680]   and I've just been playing with it now
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.440]   'cause it's been on my phone ever since.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.080]   They've really improved it.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.880]   I love the absolute abject simplicity that it works with.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   Especially now, how many times have you been on a site
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.280]   where there's just a slate or something
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.920]   where there was this article that just goes on
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.400]   for pages and pages and pages?
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.320]   And I know I wanna read this a little bit later on.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.400]   All I have to do with Stanza,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.920]   I open the desktop version of this application,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.640]   plug in the web address of that web page.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.560]   It will download all the content from that,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.720]   convert it into an ePub document
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.800]   and then with just one button push
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.840]   and if I have Stanza launched on my iPhone,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   it will simply send it to the iPhone
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.320]   and it's absolutely smooth, absolutely.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.960]   Like I said, it's not just this thing
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.520]   we're sort of keeping, you have to scroll
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.680]   with your finger side by side
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.120]   and keep pinching and zooming to navigate.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.000]   No, it turns it into an ebook.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.840]   So I would be heartbroken if I lost that ability.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.680]   - I don't see any reason why Amazon would kill that ability.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.840]   - I don't see that happening either.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   - No.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.320]   - Again, I think--
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.040]   - They put a browser in the Kindle.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.160]   I mean, they're clearly open to the notion
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.320]   that you might get free content on your Kindle.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.160]   - Well, I think they have to be
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.560]   and I think that they're going to,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.600]   I don't think they're gonna close anything down with Stanza.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.160]   I think they're going to,
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.360]   they're just taking advantage of the fact
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.720]   they have something that already manages that.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.840]   They don't have to figure it out.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.480]   It's cheaper, a lot of these decisions are made by,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.320]   we need to build another reader
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.600]   how much would it cost to buy them
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.200]   versus how much would it cost for us to develop it ourselves
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.800]   and it was just cheaper to,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.520]   I'm sure Lex cycle wasn't hugely costly.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.080]   - So I didn't realize, so they have a desktop application
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.880]   as well besides the--
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   - Desktop apps for both Mac and PC.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   It's also my favorite just desktop book readers.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.680]   It's such a wonderful piece of software
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.040]   and it's free, so far it's free.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.880]   - Yeah.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.040]   - Well, one of the most important things
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.320]   that Amazon has to do is that I really do think
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.720]   that they want the name of the application
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.760]   to simply be Kindle because they can't have Stanza
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.680]   be their iPhone, iPhone presentation.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   Just like when they come up with an Android version,
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   the Android version is gonna be called Kindle.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.080]   So maybe we'll also see Lex cycle technology,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.640]   Lex cycle designs in all these other mobile devices
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.720]   'cause we know that the iPhone is just the start for them.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.480]   - You have to think the hard part was doing the back-end stuff
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   and the database stuff and now it's about,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.680]   maybe fairly easy to port this to other platforms.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.800]   - Well, I think that I think this is a great
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.520]   direction for Amazon.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.360]   Say again?
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.200]   - It is.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.040]   - I think it's a great direction for Amazon
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.240]   to look at not how do we tie all of our content
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.000]   to one device, but as Andy would say,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.600]   how do we tie our content to all the devices?
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.440]   - Right, okay.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.560]   - I'll let you buy content 'cause I think that the end goal
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.920]   really for Amazon is to sell the razors,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.600]   sell which are the books.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.240]   - I also had sort of an evil thought
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.760]   that Amazon is probably very aware of either
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   what definitely will be happening at some point in the future
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.120]   or what very likely will be happening at some point
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.520]   in the future and maybe they're deciding that it would be
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.880]   a very, if Apple were to come up and they tablet sized device,
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.400]   it would be a useful thing to have people on staff
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.880]   or used to building touch baked software
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.200]   that uses Apple's, that uses Xcode.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.640]   - And let's face it, the Kindle isn't the business.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.000]   Selling books is the business.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.840]   - Right, right.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.200]   - The Kindle is just them jump starting this market
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.040]   which didn't work.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.920]   - What do they care if you're using it on an iPhone
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.120]   or a Mac tablet as long as you're buying it from Amazon?
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.400]   - And I think for people who are interested in
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.080]   Daisy Whitney and I go back and forth with us.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.720]   She has a Kindle, she loves it.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.120]   And I don't like the way it looks.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.040]   You know, I don't like the way the new Kindle's pretty pretty.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.880]   Have you played with it?
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.200]   - No, I mean, I just don't like,
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.960]   I mean, I really want color and I want video embedded
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.520]   and I want, you know, like I want all these other things
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.360]   that it doesn't provide.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.720]   And her big thing is, is that she can keep it in her purse
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.960]   for a week.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.600]   She can open it up, she doesn't have to charge it.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.240]   She can download stuff immediately.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.280]   And so I think that there's still gonna be a great market
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.560]   that is, I am interested in actual books.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.280]   And I think, and that's all I'm interested in.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.000]   For me, I don't wanna carry that many,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.160]   definitely that many devices that are that size.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.280]   If Apple puts out a tablet,
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.960]   I wanna be able to, everything's your tablet.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.440]   I just want everything to exist around that tablet.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.600]   - Well, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.080]   I mean, it probably would cut it heavily
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.280]   in the sales of the Kindle.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.880]   I wouldn't buy another Kindle if I had that.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.720]   - Yeah.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.560]   - Well, we don't know for sure yet
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.160]   that they've actually made money back on the Kindle yet.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.600]   It really had all the earmarks
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.080]   of the crazy billionaire CEO project sort of thing,
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.280]   where a project comes into existence,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.760]   not because any numbers were able to convince the company
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.960]   that they're gonna make money on it,
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.640]   but because the one guy who has the ability to say yes
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.560]   or no to anything decides that it's important
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.960]   that we go into this area.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.360]   - Well, I think it was a masterful move though.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.880]   I mean, I think that you can't get,
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.640]   until you had a large device
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.440]   that will allow you to download electronic books.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.320]   There was no way to get this thing off the ground.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.240]   I mean, I think that even if they lost
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.600]   a billion dollars on it, it was worth it.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.160]   - Not only that, they got that really great first beachhead
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   where even today, I think that the Kindle's been around
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.880]   for a year and a half, two years now.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.680]   Even now, chances are excellent
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.800]   that if I'm reading a Kindle on the subway,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.840]   someone will ask me, "Hey, is that the Kindle?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.400]   "Can I take a look at it?"
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.920]   They're not thinking, "Hey, do you have generic ePub
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.400]   "reader devices based on that?"
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.120]   (laughing)
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.520]   - Well, and a good example is,
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.240]   Sony has had ereaders out for much longer than Amazon
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.120]   and just has never been able to get it off,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.760]   without having that interconnection,
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   they've never been able to get it off the ground.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.240]   - Because they're selling the reader devices,
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.280]   they were not selling the library of books available for it.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   - Right.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   - What I'm trying right now is Stanza.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.120]   - And this is the advantage,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.760]   I think that both Amazon and Apple has,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.680]   which is that they, you know,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   by having more than one part of the market,
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.440]   people often will say that their market
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.040]   is their business is too complicated.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.840]   You know, they're doing too many different things,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.560]   but the thing is is by having access to different,
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.040]   two sides of the same market,
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.680]   Apple selling, using software to sell hardware
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   and Amazon using hardware to sell software,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.800]   you know, but having both sides of that mix
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.400]   gives them a little bit more of a vertical market
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.440]   and the ability to do things that you can't do without it.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.640]   - So I'm sharing, so I've downloaded an article
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.480]   from the Atlantic Monthly,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.840]   which I can't get off my Kindle onto my iPhone
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.760]   'cause the iPhone Kindle app doesn't do a periodicals.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.640]   So I put that in Stanza.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.680]   Walk me through this, Andy, and now I share it.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.600]   - Yeah, just to actually, all you gotta do is,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.200]   I don't have the application from me right now,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.560]   but if you go into the menu that simply says sharing.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.760]   - I turn that off. - Yeah.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.600]   - Okay, and believe it or not, that's all you need to do.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.000]   When you launch Stanza on the iPhone,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   it simply will be able to see every single document
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.760]   that you have open in Stanza on the desktop,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.320]   and you can selectively say, yes, this one,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.640]   please download it and put it on my phone.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.560]   - Wow, that's about as easy as you can get.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.080]   - It threw me 'cause it was too easy.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.800]   I was expecting an explicit button that says,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.280]   "Please take this on the desktop,"
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.640]   says, "Please send this to my iPhone,"
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.560]   but no, it's like, "Hey, I see that you have four documents open.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.360]   "Would you want to look at them?"
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.640]   - Well, so I have this Atlantic Monthly article open.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.080]   I've just gotta get on my Wi-Fi network
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.680]   'cause that's how you do it right via Wi-Fi.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.200]   And then once I do, there's an entry in the Stanza library
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.760]   that says shared books, and we'll see
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.400]   that thing shared on my desktop,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.840]   and I can put it on my Stanza.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.200]   Wow, that's, that is, now you've,
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.000]   and that makes me wanna use this more, I love that.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.280]   - And the thing, what you need to understand is
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.080]   that Stanza desktop supports just about every single file
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.000]   format that you can dump text into.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.120]   So it'll work for Word documents, it'll work for EPUB,
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.040]   it'll work for unprotected Amazon Kindle books.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.480]   It will, basically, any single file that you can use
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.200]   to have text, and it will open it to EPUB,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.600]   convert to a Stanza book and send it to your iPhone.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.680]   - Well, it did a great job with this.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   I mean, you can see that this is the Atlantic Monthly website,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.040]   and there's text, but there's ads,
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.840]   there's all sorts of other stuff in there,
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.400]   and I just put in the URL, as you said,
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.480]   and it turned it into plain, clear, easy-to-read text.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.520]   You know, I mean, it did a beautiful job of it, actually.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.440]   - As often as not, it can actually,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.080]   it's very, very smart, and that we'll look
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.040]   at the first few bits of the file
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.560]   and try to figure out what the title is
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.680]   and who the author is.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.160]   And it doesn't always work perfectly,
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.440]   but I'm amazed that it'll take a random webpage,
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.960]   and it will most just simply have text in the middle of it.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   It will simply say, "title of the book,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.400]   buy the author of the book."
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.920]   - Yeah, this is pretty amazing.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   So I just opened it up on my iPhone,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.640]   and then it asked me, "Are you gonna allow this
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.600]   on my iMac?"
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.280]   And I said, "Yes, always allow."
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.960]   There's the article.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.360]   I press it.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.920]   I guess I press the download button,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.760]   and that's it.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.840]   It's gonna be in Stanza.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.520]   - What a great way to find a bunch of stuff to put on your,
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.000]   and you do this all the time on the training stuff?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.480]   - All the time, again, it's how I carry documents around.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.600]   I know that you can use other applications
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.280]   to actually copy the files in and use the standard reader,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.240]   but this treats them like little, palm-top e-books,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.920]   and the formatting is just magical and automatic.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.760]   - Yeah.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.120]   - And of course, I've set the font really big,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   so please, that's just so you can see it.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.960]   You don't have to--
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.440]   - You've got a teleprompter size.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.480]   - Yeah, you don't actually have to set it so big,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.720]   but that's really cool.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.560]   I mean, there it is.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.720]   I was doing it while we were talking.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.640]   I mean, that was that easy to do.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.480]   Wow, that's really cool.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.040]   So good move, Amazon.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.840]   I think we all agree.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.920]   That's kind of exactly the kind of,
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.800]   Jeff Bezos is rapidly becoming the Steve Jobs
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.920]   of online retailing.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.240]   I mean, he seems to have it.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.440]   - Well, and he does things in the same way that Steve does it.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   When they first started selling things other than books,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.280]   I was like, I don't understand why they go
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.440]   into some market they don't belong in Amazon.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.960]   When I think of Amazon, I think of books.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.520]   And the fact that they're selling,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.480]   and it took me a year before I started buying anything
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.320]   other than books.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.320]   And now, if it's, I will only break down
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.640]   and buy something anywhere else,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.560]   if I can't find it on Amazon.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.880]   - Yeah.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.680]   - Yeah, I was kind of disappointed with myself
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.760]   because I had a lot of money in Amazon credits
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.320]   through Amazon Associates.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.760]   And of course, I treated myself to a TV.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.000]   I think I told you about that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.920]   But only afterwards, I realized that,
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.600]   oh, I forgot how much stuff they actually have.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.120]   That could have been like my grocery bill
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.440]   for the entire year.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.360]   Never have to go grocery shopping
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.480]   for the entire 2009, 2010 season almost.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   - So Jeff Bezos, on top of everything else,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.520]   remember that he has his own space fleet.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.120]   (laughing)
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.640]   - He's a man to be reckoned with.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   - I'm wondering if I can get a flight from,
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   you know, a high orbit flight from New Mexico to Australia.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.440]   - On Amazon.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.280]   - You know, on Amazon, I'll be able to order it.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.680]   - Just to order it and set up the date.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.760]   That'll be awesome.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.240]   - Tobias Vemmerby says in our Twitter conversations
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.920]   from on Friend Feed,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.000]   "Stanza is available in Europe.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.240]   "Kindle is not."
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.080]   - Oh, oh.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.920]   - Very interesting.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.120]   Now that might make it a little difficult with rights.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.920]   Because I think the real reason you can't get Kindle,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.320]   and use Kindle in other countries outside the US,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.680]   is they have a negotiated rights with the publishers, right?
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.720]   I'm sure Amazon wants to do it.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.560]   - Although it's weird, Amazon.com cannot sell certain books
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.400]   that are only available in the UK.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.520]   But if you go to amazon.co.uk
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.400]   and try to buy a Mckenides latest book,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.360]   they will sell it to you and ship it to you across the ocean.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.200]   - I know.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.840]   - They're not working too hard about that.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.480]   - Yeah, I mean, letter of the law, not spirit.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.320]   - Yeah.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.880]   - There are a lot of things that are gonna have to be torn down
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.840]   and built up for this sort of internet,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.280]   international commerce to really start working again.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.200]   - Well, I mean, the thing is, the media companies,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.920]   whether it's print or all the way to movies,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.880]   have created a lucrative business around the idea
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.320]   of slicing the world up into little pieces.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.600]   And it's also what's now killing them.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.760]   Because part of a lot of piracy comes from people
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.120]   who aren't willing to wait three months
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.880]   for transformers to get to their country.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.720]   - Yeah.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.280]   But a lot of it is of benefit to the authors.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   I mean, when I was writing features for Playboy,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.240]   it was, every month was Christmas because they got me,
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.360]   they gave me a nice big check
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.200]   because they published it in the United States.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.640]   And then next month, they say, oh, by the way,
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.400]   we also sold it to Britain and France or her two more checks.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.520]   Month later, oh, Italy took it and Brazil took it
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.160]   and Russia took it.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.280]   - Do they have different pictures
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.200]   and different editions or is it the same pictures?
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   - The tattoos are in different languages.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.440]   (laughing)
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.240]   I don't normally cover lawsuit stories
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.600]   because they're a dime a dozen, everybody's suing Apple,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.720]   or Apple's suing everybody.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.760]   But now here's somebody suing Apple.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   And I think in a kind of an interesting story,
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.760]   this is from Macworld Magazine.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.400]   Yesterday, the company is,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.720]   the owner operative, a technology discussion forum
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.000]   is suing Apple because Apple's lawyers demanded
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.560]   that bluewickie.com, b-l-u-w-i-k-i.com
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.640]   remove a project called iPod hash
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.040]   because it was circumventing DMCA copy protection,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.520]   the lawsuit was filed in the US District Court
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.840]   for the Northern District of California,
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.800]   the most liberal of the US District Courts
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.280]   by the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.360]   and a company representing bluewickie
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.600]   that's called ODO works is the name of the company,
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.680]   attorneys representing ODO works in bluewickie.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.880]   Lawyers argue the iPod hash discussions
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.200]   were about reverse engineering software,
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.560]   not breaking copy protection
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.520]   and ask for a court ruling to clarify this matter.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.840]   This could be a significant case
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:41.160]   in DMCA law and also significant for Apple.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.560]   - Well, it would stay an appeal for 20 years.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.200]   - Yeah, no one's ever gonna get to do that,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.960]   in my opinion, I mean, it'll take a long time.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.800]   And if you look at the cross-section of the courts
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.280]   and of the presidency and everything else,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.640]   the chances of them getting what they're asking for
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.480]   is very low.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.760]   The FFF and ODO works say iPod hash
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.080]   was trying to get the iPod and iPhone
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.960]   to work with other software like Winamp or Songbird,
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.920]   in other words, to bypass and around iTunes.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.760]   The work would also help iPhone and iPod users
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.560]   who ran Linux 'cause there is no iTunes for Linux.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.480]   In December 17th letter to the Electronic Frontier
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.560]   Foundation, Apple's law firm said,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.920]   "The FFF is mistaken to assume this technology
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.280]   "is only used to authenticate iTunes."
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.880]   The work also threatens the Fair Play Copy Protection.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   That's what they're gonna defend it.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.400]   - Yeah, and Apple is contractually obligated
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.320]   to do everything they can to protect them.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.680]   - Well, the DMCA protects them.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.200]   If that's in fact what the software was designed
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.560]   or could do, then the DMCA is the law of the land.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.280]   We still have, you know, there haven't been a whole lot
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:48.440]   of court cases around the DMCA's anti-reversal thing.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.640]   This is a good one for this week in law.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.880]   I'm sure they will talk about it.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.600]   ODO says what this guy was doing was legitimate.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.480]   He was just trying to reverse engineer Apple's products
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.040]   to get them to work with Linux,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.880]   which by the way was what DVD John said when he cracked CSS,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.840]   the copy protection in DVDs.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.240]   Just wanted to run it on Linux for crying out loud.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   - That's my story, I'm sticking to it.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.720]   (laughing)
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.160]   - So did you guys cover, have you guys covered
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.440]   the baby shaking?
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.120]   - No, we haven't.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.480]   In fact, since we were here last,
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.080]   Apple has sold one billion iPhone applications.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.440]   The one billionth application was bump.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.280]   - Bump.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.960]   - But what would have been an interesting story
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.560]   if it had been shaking baby?
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.760]   - It would have been a public relations nightmare.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.560]   - How this got through, I don't know.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.360]   - Well, there are people up there that are posting,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.880]   you know, I think it was in the New York Times today
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.720]   that someone was actually defending the,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.840]   well, saying that Apple should not have brought
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.680]   taking it down.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.520]   - What?
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.920]   - They shouldn't have put it up.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.120]   - Well, here's the interesting thing about it.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.240]   Now, I think this has taken it down.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.680]   - If you're not gonna put an application up,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.000]   you've got a baby, you know about this.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.840]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.040]   - I think they should have taken it down.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.960]   So I'm not, there's no--
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.800]   - They should never have gotten it.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.720]   - They should never gotten it.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.080]   But the one thing that is starting to percolate is
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.880]   this gets into being defendable
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   when you start taking some stuff down and other stuff.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.320]   - Well, they have to be, yeah.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.280]   - Now you get into a situation where, you know,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.320]   it's much more complicated.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.800]   You know, YouTube, that was always their argument.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.360]   That was their safe harbor was that they said,
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.680]   you know, we don't, you know, you have to tell us
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.520]   what to take down.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.600]   We're not gonna take, we're not gonna,
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.360]   'cause as soon as they start making that decision,
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.080]   it makes them liable for anything that goes through.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.840]   So part of the reason that Apple has to react to this
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   very quickly is that they've already shown
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.320]   that they don't let everything through.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.760]   You know, and that creates a much higher level of,
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.840]   if anything, you know, anything like this goes through,
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.640]   Apple is much more culpable because they've said
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.200]   that they, we are going to filter it.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   - Right.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:42.880]   - They can either say that they're not gonna
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.720]   filter it out, they're gonna filter it tightly.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.800]   - I think what they say here is, oops, we made it.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.640]   It was a mistake.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.480]   - It was a mistake.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   - It slipped through, obviously it slipped through.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.320]   I mean, if you look at it,
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.240]   it's a reprehensible application that just,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.560]   somebody was eating lunch when that one came through
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.560]   and they just rubber stamped it or something.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.880]   - Well, there's a lot of applications coming through.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.440]   - To their credit, yeah.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.080]   I think to the Apple's credit, I'll defend them here.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.400]   They're trying to streamline the process
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   so applications have been waiting sometimes for months
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.720]   are getting in there faster.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.200]   That's what developers and users have been demanding.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.520]   And mistakes happen.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.440]   And as soon as people called attention to it,
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.880]   they pulled it right down and apologized.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.720]   - And the hard part for the application developers
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.400]   is they're now going to have to wait longer
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.560]   for their apps to go through.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.760]   - Well, maybe, I don't know.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.560]   Maybe, I mean, I'm sure a memo went out.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.640]   Please look carefully, folks.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.120]   - There's a question that should be asked.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.160]   Are there tracks in the iTunes store
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.320]   that are about killing cops?
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.160]   - I'm sure, well, the musical.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.320]   - Okay, okay.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.520]   - But so if we're defending the rights,
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.800]   and I think we should defend the rights of creative people,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.200]   if we're willing to defend those rights
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.600]   of people who are creating music,
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.040]   why are we not defending the rights
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.840]   of people who are creating software?
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.400]   - Well, I hate to go there.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.080]   - Well, I think that the reason that we,
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.720]   because one of the, what was brought up,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.080]   and I just don't have the article in front of me
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.440]   from the "In the New York Times" was that there wasn't,
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.960]   I think there was a South Park application
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.800]   that got turned down,
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.120]   but of course you can buy South Park on the iTunes.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.240]   Now, the reason is that Apple doesn't have control
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.040]   over what the media companies put on iTunes,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.200]   and Apple has a lot of control
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.400]   over what they put in the app store.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.040]   - But do you think Apple would want to get in that business
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.640]   of saying what content and songs and TV shows would be allowed?
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.960]   - I think that they would if they could, and they really.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.560]   - Yeah, I think they would.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.800]   I think the reason that they don't do that
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.480]   is because it's complicated enough to get them to agree
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.320]   to putting their stuff on iTunes.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.240]   I think if Apple could make it a clean interface,
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.320]   I mean a clean environment, I think Apple absolutely.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.600]   I think they wouldn't.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.440]   - That's interesting.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.280]   - I don't think, I don't think Apple would,
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.960]   I don't think Steve Jobs would think twice about
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.800]   slicing about.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.160]   - I'll be honest, I wouldn't think twice about knocking
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.840]   that shaken baby application.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.320]   - No, I'm saying, but I think that Apple,
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.680]   if Apple was given the ability,
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.760]   it would shave down a lot of this stuff,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.840]   but they don't want to do anything
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.640]   that pushes up against the media.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:58.920]   They just don't have the leverage.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.000]   They have the leverage with the apps,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.160]   they don't have the leverage with the media,
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.600]   and I think that's the only reason Apple doesn't tighten that up.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.080]   They use the explicit tag that's as far as they're going to go.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.320]   - I mean, Apple has a really wonderful opportunity
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.320]   that I don't think they'll ever take advantage of,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.040]   but a really great opportunity to have
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.240]   sort of the best of both worlds.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.800]   Parents want their kids to have these devices
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.120]   and to enjoy media.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.600]   They also want to have some control
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.320]   and some sort of a say over the kind of content
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.520]   that they put on that media.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.360]   All this sort of content on the iTunes store is Apple Tag.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.440]   Now I know that Apple is also doing a good job
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.600]   of putting parental controls not just on desktops,
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.200]   but also on the iPhones and on the iPods themselves.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.760]   What if we had this wonderful,
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.240]   a different sort of world in which Apple no longer,
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.800]   Apple will still prevent a dangerous piece of software
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.040]   from being installed on the iPhone.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.160]   It'll still prevent an illegal piece of software
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.840]   from being installed upon the iPhone,
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.120]   but when it comes to a matter of taste,
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.560]   they will simply allow the consumer to make that decision.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.800]   And if the consumer is the parent of a child,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.880]   they will simply have the ability to tell the iPhone,
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.780]   look, any application, any game that is violent,
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.240]   any music that's violent,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.320]   or anything that involves lighting your farts
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.800]   through the magic of iPhone,
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.920]   we're not gonna allow you to install this on the device.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.840]   I mean, I see both sides of this argument.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.160]   - It's difficult to know where the line is.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.520]   It's kind of hard to, but you know, I mean.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   - Which is why content providers should largely stay out of it.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.240]   Although Apple had really good intentions
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.800]   in making sure they don't,
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.000]   they don't wanna associate iPhone apps
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.360]   right out the gate with pornography and all this sort of junk.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.760]   But now that they've established that,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.920]   this is a really large and diverse world of software.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.560]   I don't know, I'm not displeased
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.280]   that shaken baby has been taken off.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.200]   I'm also not displeased.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.400]   I also, that other software doesn't get approved.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.920]   But that's, I don't think that's the ideal
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.120]   that we should be aiming for.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.760]   - Brian Brushwood on Twitch,
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.000]   when we talked about this suggested
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.280]   that maybe there should be tears.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.560]   There should be, you know, just as they're in a way,
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.400]   here's the problem.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.800]   - Here's the secondary tier of apps
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.040]   that are, you know, not Apple approved, but.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.960]   - I think that Apple doesn't want someone showing,
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.600]   I think exactly what Andy was saying.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.320]   I don't think Apple wants anyone showing someone
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.680]   the shaken baby app on their iPhone
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.120]   to anyone else in public.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.440]   (laughs)
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.360]   I think that's the issue.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.880]   And I think that they're not gonna,
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.440]   and I don't think of.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.960]   - So they're turning down a multi-billion dollar mango
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.240]   market in Japan, 'cause one of those business people
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.400]   are gonna be reading Mark Twain on this subway.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.800]   I don't think so.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.080]   - Well, no, well, I think when it comes to content,
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.720]   Apple might go in a different direction.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.080]   But when it comes to the applications
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.160]   where they have a lot of control,
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.520]   I think that they're gonna.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.400]   - That's frustrating.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.200]   And in a great way, that's a really frustrating position
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.400]   to be spending $300 for a device,
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.480]   and Daddy is telling us, well, kitten, we don't want you.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.840]   I think we'd reflect poorly about our name
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.360]   if you were to use this device in a way
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.760]   that we would really approve.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.520]   I'm sure that in time, you'll agree
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.920]   that we were a little bit wiser than you.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.760]   - That's true, no babies were actually harmed
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.360]   in the creation of shaken baby.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.200]   - Oh, man, I just, it's creepy.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.040]   I don't have any problems.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:55:59.880]   - Anybody has kids.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.880]   - Yeah, and the peers of the problem is I have a small son.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.760]   - You have a baby.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.600]   - You know, and.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.640]   - Another one on the way.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.480]   - And if someone was shaking my baby,
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.040]   I'd shake them until they weren't moving.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:09.880]   - Yeah.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.520]   - So the thing is that they, you know,
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   so the, so the.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.960]   - How about if they give them ratings?
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.480]   That's more suggestions than our IRs.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.680]   - I just don't want anyone who makes that application
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.520]   to make any money.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   That's the problem is that I, I mean,
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.680]   and I admit I am completely.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.160]   - What would you do about the rap,
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.280]   the gangster rap that says "Kill a cop"?
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.080]   - I can't, I don't even understand what they're saying.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.000]   - So, you know, I don't know what, you know, so it's.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.600]   - It doesn't, what I cop out.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.280]   - You know, it's hard.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.560]   There's a slippery slope when you start.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.400]   - There is a slippery slope.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.000]   I don't know where the line is.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.520]   And I know that, you know, it's just like,
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.080]   I'm just completely like, don't need,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.920]   there's some things.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.760]   - Don't need to help me.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.600]   - Just look at it and you go.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.440]   - You don't need to help them.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.280]   - Yeah.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.000]   - That's just not, that's just so awful.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.200]   - I've only had to spend first amendment of creative rights,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.240]   but you know what?
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.880]   Let's wait for the next one to defend all the,
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.160]   that's what Ken, we didn't hear about this one.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.320]   - What did he say, Shakin'?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.160]   - What?
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.560]   - The book of poetry from homosexual dissidents
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.040]   and in communist countries will defend that.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:07.880]   - Yeah, that one.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.720]   - Well, that one.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.560]   - The thing is, I think there's a difference
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.760]   between saying that making that application is illegal
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.360]   and a company making a decision
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.840]   that they're not gonna distribute it.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.080]   And I don't think the companies,
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.520]   I think companies have, I think companies have the right.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.960]   I don't think the government has the right to say
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.800]   that you can't say X, Y, and Z or do X, Y, and Z,
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.640]   but I don't think, but I think a company is within its rights
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.400]   to decide that we are not going to,
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.600]   I mean, completely within its rights.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.320]   It is not a First Amendment issue for Apple to decide
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.000]   that it's not gonna distribute certain kinds of things
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.400]   anymore than a bookstore deciding
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.040]   that it's not gonna distribute certain kinds of books.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.880]   - Or Amazon, yeah.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.760]   - Apple is completely within its First Amendment rights
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.040]   to say we're not gonna distribute that.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.120]   And we're not talking about the government,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.480]   I completely agree that the government can't do that.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:52.480]   But I am, but I think that we extend this First Amendment right
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.160]   that the government is being held to to private companies
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.200]   and I don't think that's appropriate.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.640]   I think companies should be allowed to decide
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.480]   what they wanna do that.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.800]   - I don't think Apple is wrong.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.280]   I just think that overall the situation falls somewhat
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.000]   short of the ideal, that's all I'm saying.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.120]   - Let's, I mean, Kiwi Nerd brings this up in our chat room.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.900]   Here's an application that is in the iTunes store.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.200]   It's called iGirl.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.160]   And the description is, "Blow her, shake her, touch her,
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.280]   "and more.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.840]   "Check out the new custom voices."
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.240]   (laughing)
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.560]   Zoom and rotate the iGirl.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   Use the dance icon to make her dance.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.360]   Shake the iPhone, see how the iGirl reacts.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.480]   Touch the iGirl to give her a tickle.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.840]   - And clearly this is misogynistic.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.160]   - And now they're in a weird--
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.000]   - If it keeps you away from the sheep, they're in New Zealand.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.360]   All I'm all for it, I mean.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.360]   (laughing)
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.440]   - I just, I don't know what to say.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.280]   You know, you're right.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.360]   And this is why it's a slippery slope.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.440]   Where do you stop?
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.000]   I mean, clearly killing babies is a little worse
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.760]   than misogynistic tickling.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.600]   - Yeah.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.520]   - I don't know where the line is.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.360]   - I don't know where the line is.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.200]   - But I think that's the problem.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.600]   - But I think that it's within Apple's right
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.800]   to decide that on their own.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.640]   - Their private business.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.240]   - Absolutely group that.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.840]   - So let's dodge this bullet as quickly as we can.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.600]   - And get the heck out of here.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.880]   - It's easier to talk about the found applications.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   I mean, they're funny.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.120]   - They're funny and it's protected to speech.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.960]   Even if it is coming out of your butt.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.640]   - One billion iPhones, I mean, sorry,
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.000]   applications downloaded the Connor Mulcahy age 13
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.760]   of Weston, Connecticut downloaded the one billionth app.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.000]   Thank God it wasn't IFART.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.560]   It was Bump, which is a free application
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.680]   that allows you to copy your contacts,
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.360]   I think from your iPod Touch to your iPhone.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.760]   He won a $10,000 iTunes gift card.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.680]   - Nice.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:46.680]   That's all I gotta say.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.520]   Nice.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.360]   - Yes, sweet.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.200]   - Sweet.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.880]   - Hey, quick, pick your songs.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.880]   Quick, you got 30 days, quick.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.520]   - No, he has a lifetime to use it.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:55.600]   - And I would use them at 30 days.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.800]   - I could use $10,000 in 30 days.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.640]   - Sure.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.040]   - I think my dad couldn't get his iTunes working
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.480]   and within five minutes after I got it working for him
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.440]   over the phone, he had about 25 more songs.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   (laughing)
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.720]   - Well, that's why I wish they'd do a subscription model.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.840]   'Cause on the Zoom, when you have the subscription model,
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.360]   in effect, you have millions of songs.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.320]   You just pick whatever you want.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   You don't ever think about the money
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.160]   and you just put it on there
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.640]   and the problem is you have to do with the Zoom.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.680]   So I want Apple to do this.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.360]   - Well, I think a hybrid would be the end
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.080]   of every other service.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.920]   - I still don't understand why they haven't done this.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.040]   Well, why not?
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.640]   Is it Steve that doesn't want to do it?
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.600]   What doesn't want to do this?
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.040]   - You know, I think that it's,
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.400]   I think they just don't think there's a market there,
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.800]   but I think that part of what makes it work
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.560]   is that the market is so big that if you could all,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.800]   now that you can buy all these,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.080]   and I think we're almost getting to that point,
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.640]   now that you can buy 256 DRM-free,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.680]   if you still took the fair play
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.720]   that you already have installed on every iPhone,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.320]   or I mean every iPod and you had 128 bit,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.400]   or even 96 bit or whatever,
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.760]   that is free. - There's a good rule.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.560]   You could, so I spend $20 a month.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.560]   So now Apple gets $20 a month for me to have everything
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   and then all on top of that.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.400]   - You'll end up buying this stuff
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.480]   'cause you want the better quality.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.160]   - And if I want the better quality and I want it
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.760]   to be DRM-free and I want to do whatever I want,
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.120]   I can buy it.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.440]   And if you did that hybrid,
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.560]   and then you take 50% or 60%,
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.280]   and basically people make money on the percentage
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.600]   of Sting gets 50% of all the downloads that,
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.920]   but he won't, but I mean, if he got it,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.240]   he would get half the pot.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.080]   And this is how like Lynda.com works, you know?
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   And so it's not an unknown, you know,
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.960]   and that hybrid is the only company
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.600]   that could do that hybrid is Apple.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.200]   And if they did it, the record industry would make more money,
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.240]   Apple would make more money,
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.440]   and everyone would use it.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.520]   - Is it Apple stopping it or the record industry?
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.160]   - I think it's Apple because I think the record industry
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.760]   would love for you to pay a subscription.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.440]   - Yeah, they certainly don't fight against it
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.280]   on other sites.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.800]   - Yeah, the record company would love subscription-based model
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.960]   because that would be a totally inverse of the relationship
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.720]   that they have with Apple right now,
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.920]   where they make money off of all those downloads,
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.040]   and Apple has to pay to serve all those files.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.160]   The difference, whenever when I buy a 99 cent download,
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.800]   I'm basically subsidizing the cost of hosting
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.960]   and serving that file.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.400]   If I'm paying 20 bucks, whether I download 15 gigabytes a day
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.320]   or 15 cents worth a month,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   you know, that could easily run into damage for Apple, I think.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.560]   - Well, but I think it's about the bandwidth
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.400]   that might be consumed.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.680]   - Number one, it kind of works for the Zoom
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.520]   'cause for God's sakes, who do you know?
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.360]   - Who's doing it?
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.760]   - I think there are three Zunes in this state
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.080]   right now, and I've got two of them that I was loaned
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.920]   for for editorial purposes.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.240]   When you have the most single most popular music player
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.600]   in the world switching to a subscription-based model,
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.360]   that's gotta be really difficult to try to serve
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360]   that much data.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.720]   - I have a four gig Zoom that I use just because
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.400]   I have the subscription model, and I can put stuff on there.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.240]   - Well, I think-- - But it's great.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   I love subscription-based.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.360]   - Yeah, I think that the thing though is that if you made
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.520]   the file smaller, whether it's 128 or 96,
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.120]   what happens is there's generally a surge
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.960]   where people fill up their thing, but then after that,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.880]   there's not, you just can't, it's the Netflix thing.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.920]   You can't consume fast enough to make it worth--
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.160]   - Well, you know what, changing it that much,
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.200]   and if someone was paying 20 bucks a month,
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.960]   they will use up two or three dollars a month in bandwidth.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.800]   - In the long run.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.880]   - In the long run, and if Apple, still,
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   the record companies would do great.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.480]   Getting people hooked on the idea that I'm gonna
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   rent stuff, and then, oh, by the way, I can buy it as well.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.080]   I think that that would be a pretty hot come on.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.640]   I do, Andy, I will say that doing this for movies
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.760]   would be very, very difficult, specifically because
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.160]   of the size of the movies, but doing it for songs,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.360]   I think is easier because they're so small.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.440]   - Mm.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.320]   Well, you heard us speak, Apple.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.240]   I hope you're listening.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   We're gonna take a break, come back with our picks
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.560]   of the week before we do that, though.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.120]   It's time for our Audible Pick of the Week,
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.400]   Audible, our fine sponsor.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.520]   We love having them on the show.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.640]   We invite you to visit audible.com/macbreak
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.920]   for a free book, yes, so I have to do a sign up
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.120]   for the gold account, which gives you one book a month.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.760]   I'm a platinum member myself,
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.360]   'cause I eat books two at a time.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.800]   But if you're new to Audible, this is a good way
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.360]   to just kind of get your feet wet one book a month,
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.040]   choose from 50,000 titles, and the first one's free.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.000]   I'm gonna give Andy a break this week,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.120]   'cause I have a recommendation.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.840]   We were talking before the show about conspiracies,
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.480]   and I know people, especially now with the swine flu,
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.440]   and people love the idea that there's something secret
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.720]   and magic going on in the world
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.920]   that if you could only find out what it is,
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.880]   everything would suddenly make sense.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.800]   Wouldn't that be nice if everything just made sense?
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   Oh, it's because of the ninth Templar and the Illuminati.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.480]   Well, this was a book that was very big in the '60s.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.440]   I remember reading it when I was in high school,
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.040]   and it's on Audible, and it is a hoot,
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.600]   whether you believe in conspiracies or not.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.240]   It's called the Illuminati Trilogy,
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.560]   and start with Part One.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.680]   It's by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.320]   It's chaotic, it's crazy.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.240]   It's got, by the way, more '80s band names
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.000]   came out of this book than any other book
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.400]   in the history of the world.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.000]   This is evil.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.080]   Part One is the Eye of the Pyramid.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.160]   You can also read Part One and Part Two and Three.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.640]   It's a three-parter, a trilogy, you see.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.520]   Highly, highly recommend this, though.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.160]   You want to play a little excerpt of this.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.720]   This is the Illuminati, Part One, The Eye and the Pyramid,
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.080]   because you know that, though.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   - Free me, ringmaster.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   Then that crown sits uneasily on my head, if I have a head.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.360]   And I must warn you that the troop is small
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.200]   for a universe this size,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.000]   and many of us have to double or triple our stints.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.240]   So you can expect me back in many other guises.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.880]   Indeed, do many things come to pass.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.160]   - This is clearly one of the conspiracy masters right there.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.960]   What a great-- - Captain, you have failed
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.440]   your saving throw.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.040]   You lose 10 experience points, eight health points,
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.520]   and you skip the next turn.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   - Wouldn't it be nice if your dungeon master sounded like that?
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.000]   (laughing)
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.240]   - Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbeck do a bang-up job
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.080]   of narrating this.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.560]   They get the true spirit of it,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.760]   which is completely over the top, wacky,
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.200]   and yet somehow quite believable.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.440]   - In a weird, demented sort of way.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.600]   I'm gonna recommend this for Adam Curry and John C. DeVorak.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.400]   The Illuminati's trilogy, part one,
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.160]   the eye and the pyramid, our recommendation.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.320]   Now you can get this or any book free
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.880]   by just going to audible.com/macbreak.

[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.040]   whether you're driving to work,
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.480]   suffering through that commute on a long plane flight,
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.360]   doing housework, working out in the gym,
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.520]   that's where I listen.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.560]   It's great to get some reading done,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.680]   to use those down times when you can't hold a book
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.560]   and really enjoy yourself while you're doing it.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.240]   This one's, I can't wait to be laughing
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.760]   on the treadmill to this one.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.080]   Audible.com/macbreak, we thank them so much
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.520]   for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.720]   Now, it is time for our picks of the week.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.800]   Alex Lindsay, you are the one in charge of the entire world.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.200]   What would you pick?
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.360]   (laughing)
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.200]   Oh, sorry.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.680]   So I have a problem.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.520]   Yes.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.360]   I have a problem.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.200]   We know this.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.880]   You're addicted to a highly expensive software.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.760]   Only modern, it looks expensive at this time.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.280]   Actually, in iPhone scale as well,
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.120]   so it's not actually not that bad.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   Oh, it's cheap.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.600]   So my problem is, is that I like to listen to NPR,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.920]   all things conditioned, all things considered.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.760]   All things conditioned.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.600]   All things conditioned.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.440]   It's their hair show.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.120]   Fantastic show.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:29.960]   Some of the best salon people.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.760]   White people just will simply react exactly the same way
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.080]   to the exact same story.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.520]   They say, "They got a down to a client now."
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.760]   And at the end of the hour,
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   they have these little stories about people,
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.080]   you know, having to watch their hair.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:41.920]   We have to donate, buddy.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.040]   That little old lady has to keep making her quilt,
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.880]   damn it.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.440]   So I like to listen to all things considered,
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.000]   and I like to listen to Morning Edition,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.480]   but I don't like to listen to the whole thing.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.120]   I like to listen to, you know,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:52.960]   and so they've, you do,
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.400]   you would assemble your own show that was on the website.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.240]   And they have it.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.560]   So NPR has this great application that allows you to,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.400]   you can, it's a little flash app
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.800]   that lets you actually just add all the stories
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.000]   and then delete the ones you don't want.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.040]   You know, rearrange them so you can listen to all the ones
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.200]   about Zimbabwe first,
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.960]   and then all the ones about the bank second,
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.320]   and then get rid of all the ones at the end of the hour.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.600]   And so that's what I tend to do.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.120]   And so anyway, the, so the problem is,
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.560]   is that I do the exact opposite.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.000]   If there's a story about Zimbabwe,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.400]   I just drop it right off the edge.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.240]   I don't wanna hear that.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.000]   So anyway, so what's the latest Swine Flu story?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:26.840]   That's what I wanna.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.840]   So, so the, so anyways,
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.360]   so we, you make this list,
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   the problem is is that then I wanna clean my house,
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.680]   and, or I wanna do whatever and listen to it,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.280]   or get ready in the morning and listen to it,
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.480]   but I can't because it's a flash app
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.400]   and I can't play it on my iPhone and I don't, you know,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.400]   there's, and I don't have one of those wireless headsets
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.240]   or whatever.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.760]   So there's an application that has solved my problem.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.680]   And it is called Airphones.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.600]   Airphones.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.360]   And so Airphones, what it does is it, it's, it's 499
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.280]   and it's an iPhone app and it comes, I guess,
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.840]   with a free, as far as I can tell,
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.880]   a free app that also installs on your Mac.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.880]   And what you do is you install Airphones on your Mac
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.040]   and then you install Airphones on your iPhone.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.800]   And what it'll do is it'll stream whatever
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.400]   it was gonna go to the speakers.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.240]   Oh, that's smart.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.080]   To your iPhone.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.040]   And so now, it's all I need to do is be connected via wifi
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.400]   and they'll, and basically what happens is
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.160]   it creates an Airphone server.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.960]   So, you know, from the, you know, from, from,
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.760]   from Airphone here and, and so.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.800]   It's just like airfoil.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.640]   I mean, isn't that what airfoil does for your company?
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.600]   But it's $25 and this is five.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.240]   So, so, so that it was something,
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.480]   it was a problem I wanted to fix.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.520]   I just didn't want to fix it for $25.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.120]   I was very interested in fixing it for five.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.960]   And so, and I have just started doing it
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.520]   and over the last couple days and it's been great.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.560]   I mean, it's, it's clear, gets garbled every once in a while
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.240]   when I get a bad, whatever, but it kind of turns your iPhone
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.120]   or your, I touch into a wireless headphones with a little
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.960]   little ball.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.880]   Exactly. You just want, you wander off and,
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.800]   and what's great is it is that there's not,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.200]   as long as my Wi-Fi network is, is there, you know,
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   I can go a lot further than I would with wireless headset,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.360]   with a wireless, you know, headphones or whatever.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.240]   You do have to use Wi-Fi for this, obviously.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.000]   Yeah, you have to use Wi-Fi.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.080]   And, but I'm, you know, I got a pretty good Wi-Fi trajectory.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.640]   And so I can, I can go, you know, all over my, both,
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.440]   you know, both my office that's behind my house
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.160]   and my house is all capable.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.600]   And, and so I can just wander about and it's, it's awesome.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.880]   So anyway, that's my, that's my pick.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.720]   Awesome, blossom. Air, phones.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.640]   It's an iPhone app.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.000]   You can get it on the app store.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.960]   My pick is a half an Alex.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.800]   Whoo!
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.320]   This is maybe the most expensive pick I've ever,
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.120]   I've ever put out, but I have to say it was worth every penny.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.960]   I, I remember when I bought my Macbook Pro,
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.440]   I got the Unibody Macbook Pro.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.840]   The minute it came out, I was very excited.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.680]   I really love it.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.960]   And I really liked how easy it was to pop the hard drive
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.320]   and I, instead of ordering a solid-state drive.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.160]   Yeah, I know it.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.080]   Instead of ordering a solid-state drive, I thought,
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.920]   well, the time will come and the prices will go down,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.280]   the capacities will go up,
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.320]   and I'll be able to get a bigger, faster one.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.360]   And it's going to be very easy to put in the MacBook Pro.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.480]   Now I, I was thinking I'm going to be waiting a little longer
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.680]   than I, I end up not waiting as long as I probably should have
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.880]   because prices and capacities are certain to go up later
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.720]   in the year.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.800]   In fact, considerably, I couldn't wait.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.640]   Me couldn't wait.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.920]   I couldn't, and you know who put me over the top?
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.000]   We do a show called PC Perspective,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.600]   in which we review hardware and we've been reviewing
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.800]   solid-state drives, Alan Maven Tano and Ryan Schraff
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.600]   from PC's Perspective and doing this.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.680]   And to be honest, they, they, they talked me into it.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.800]   I didn't want to do it.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.480]   They, they talked me into it because they said,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.600]   wait till you, wait till you see how fast your Mac boots,
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.480]   wait till you see how fast applications load
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.440]   when you put it in.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.120]   Now there are a couple of different ones you can get.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.520]   There's a very pricey Intel X25,
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.600]   which everybody agrees is, you know,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.520]   the kind of the king of these,
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.720]   but it's only 80 gigabytes.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.040]   I think it's 700 bucks.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.480]   It's very expensive.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.560]   And I said, well, shouldn't I get that?
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.600]   And they said, no, you know what?
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.400]   You don't need to get that.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.560]   They said, get the, there's, there's two others on Amazon.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.200]   I'm sure there are many other manufacturers,
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.840]   Corsair and OCZ.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.320]   I ended up getting the Corsair 128 gigabyte
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.000]   solid-state hard drive.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.040]   And let me tell you the kids,
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.520]   it was about 300, let me give you the exact price on Amazon.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.480]   I'm sure you could shop around,
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.440]   maybe even get it for less, $330.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.680]   It's about half an Alex.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.280]   - And it's fast.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.640]   - Kids, it's fast.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.960]   Fast doesn't really describe it.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.400]   Now it's not a faster writing.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.360]   It doesn't save you battery life.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.120]   - Well, it's 100 megabytes a second, isn't it?
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.400]   100 megabits a second, sorry.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.600]   So it's only, it's not that fast.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.880]   Okay, no one.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.080]   - But you know what makes it fast?
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.360]   Zero access time.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.560]   Because it's solid-state, it's flash.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.840]   So there is virtually no time to find and read a file.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.080]   So in the practical experience,
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.480]   now admittedly I went from a 370 gig hard drive
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.800]   to something half the size.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.360]   So I had to take my photos off.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.680]   I couldn't put any music and photos on my.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.480]   - I can't actually use my computer, but it's fast.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.320]   - No, I can't use it.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.880]   - No, I can't because, you know,
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   all my applications, Photoshop, everything fits.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.480]   And I still have 50 gigs left.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.960]   It's just that I can't--
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.680]   - Best desktop patterns.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.560]   - Well, I can't store everything that I'd like to store on there,
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.480]   but I have an external drive that I'm gonna take with me
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.920]   to China, you know, with a little, you know,
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.400]   Western digital pocket drives.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.680]   And I'll just use that to store photos on.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.400]   Let me tell you, the boot up time is, it's kind of scary
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.560]   because, you know, there's a length of time
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.880]   that the Mac boots up that's doing the power on self-test
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.720]   is checking the memory.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.040]   And that's not faster.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.360]   But then that's done and the screen comes up
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.040]   and nothing happens.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.040]   I thought, well, what's going on?
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.520]   It was already booted.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.800]   It was done.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.440]   It took a second after the power on self-test.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.360]   It took a second to launch everything.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.440]   Then when you launch applications, there's no bounce.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440]   They just open.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.440]   - Right.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.360]   - So there is a certain joy and pleasure and thrill
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.960]   to having that in your laptop.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.200]   It makes the whole experience seem much faster.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.280]   Everything else kind of seems to go faster.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   I mean, these MacBook Pros are fast.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.240]   I think the weakest link on the MacBook Pro
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.040]   is this slow 5,400 RPM laptop drive that's in there.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.600]   I'm a little bit less capacity, about half the capacity,
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.240]   but boy, is it a lot faster in reading.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.320]   I haven't, you know, I don't do that much writing.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.440]   So, and writing isn't a big part of my day.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   I do understand, I'm told that, for instance,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.400]   things like running 1080p movies, the seek times
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.640]   are very quick because, again,
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.160]   that's loading vast amounts of data.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.600]   It probably wouldn't help you if you're digitizing video.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.600]   - Oh, and you're right.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.440]   - It would.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.520]   - Well, I mean, well, for instance, I'm looking at one
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.880]   that I've been thinking about getting
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.840]   it's 256 gigabytes and it's almost 600 bucks.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.720]   - That's like $600 bucks.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.560]   - 600 bucks.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.400]   - And it's 600 bucks.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.080]   - Yeah, and they're telling, they're saying
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.680]   that the right speeds are 160 megabytes a second.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.760]   Now, the issue with that is that I now can,
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:06.600]   I can get uncompressed footage, 4.2.2.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.760]   Like, so, you know, uncompressed footage out of a camera
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.160]   and write it to my laptop, which is kind of an insane thought.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.480]   And so it's, and as we, you know, this is just the beginning.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.600]   It's gonna get exciting.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.440]   - Well, that's the biggest.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.280]   - We're not gonna be using a hard drive much longer.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.080]   - Yeah, I have to say this, I was a little skeptical.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.200]   I got talked into it and you know,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.520]   and I'm really glad I bought this.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.960]   I don't mind the loss of capacity.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.760]   We'll see if it lasts as long.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.240]   I've been told over and over again,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.000]   it should absolutely last as long.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   It's quieter.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.360]   You don't hear a fan, you don't hear the hard drive spinning.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.400]   You don't have, you know, I mean, it's definitely feels,
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.720]   the laptop feels different.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.840]   - Are you getting any increased battery?
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.680]   - No, no.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.440]   - And that's because really it's not the hard drive
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.480]   that's heating up all that battery.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.920]   It's that big ass screen.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.760]   - Right.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.960]   - You know, it's all the processor.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.800]   I'm using the 9600 GPU on it.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.160]   But it's nice to have a, I mean, it's one of those,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.640]   you can put this little thing in
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   and your computer feels like it's three times faster.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.480]   All of a sudden.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.320]   - Right.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.960]   - So also, I mean, I had a misadventure
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.760]   with my Macbook hard drive last year,
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.040]   you're, excuse me, year and a half ago at Mac World Expo.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.160]   So as you guys know, and it was because, of course,
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.240]   mechanical drive, I just dropped it all of like
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.800]   about a quarter to a half an inch while it was waking up
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.360]   and that was it for the whole hard drive.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.680]   I now have a 64 gig run core solid state drive
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.960]   in my little hackintosh.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.720]   And it really just gives you that wonderful feeling
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.160]   of knowing that there's nothing mechanical inside
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.000]   - Yeah.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.920]   - There's no moving parts.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.480]   - I'm gonna take really good care of it,
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.040]   but I know that if I get a little bit,
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.680]   if I'm getting a little bit fumbled finger
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.160]   because I need to close this down and get on my flight
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.280]   and I just drop it a little bit or I jostle it
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   or I want to carry it from one room to another.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.520]   I don't have to worry about it.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.760]   It'll just plain work.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.400]   It really is, I will almost happily give up
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.160]   the extra capacity for that extra piece of mind.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.480]   - Well, this is just my pick.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.600]   Just I love the speed improvement.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.400]   And by the way, the aluminum enclosure,
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.760]   even though you can't see it,
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.320]   spiritually goes so well with the unibody.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.000]   You just know that there's more aluminum inside.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.400]   (laughing)
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.640]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.240]   I mean, I saved the other drive.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.640]   I thought, well, I may end up going back to the other drive.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.480]   I don't think I will.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.320]   It really is.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.160]   - No, you just do it.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   - No, you just do it.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.600]   - You know, I decided not to.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.120]   If I, in retrospect, I should have used the migration wizard
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.560]   because I bought my mother a 13 inch MacBook
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.520]   and I used the migration, or actually my wife,
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.920]   a 13 inch MacBook and I, why did I call her my mother?
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.920]   'Cause I bought two, one for my mom and one for my wife.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.760]   (laughing)
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.120]   But my mom didn't, I couldn't do the migration.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.960]   (laughing)
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.880]   You know what's weird how you do the migration assistant
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.680]   on the MacBook 13's, which don't have fire wire,
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.360]   is you have to use, you have to put them on the network
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.320]   and it does it over the network,
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.080]   which is really sluggish.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.880]   Took me about five hours, we ran it overnight.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.200]   But it did a good job.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.000]   And I noticed, I didn't want to do it
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.480]   'cause I thought, well, I don't have enough room,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.240]   but you have enough selectivity
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.720]   that you don't have to put everything on there.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.280]   I could have left the data off.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.680]   So I should have in retrospect on that, but I didn't.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.880]   Nevertheless, it was pretty quick.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.800]   Installation goes faster.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.360]   So I think you're right, I think there is a speed up and right.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.040]   Because the one thing I did, which was a lot of writing,
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.080]   was installing, the developer tools installed
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.480]   in a minute or two is pretty lickety split.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.120]   So I'm pretty happy about it.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.840]   And things like, because of that,
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.400]   if you're on the road and you're compressing video,
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.680]   this is gonna make a huge difference
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.720]   because the read write is a huge chunk of compressing video
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.680]   because I have to read lots of frames.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.520]   Read them, read them, read them.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.760]   'Cause there's so many frames that it's,
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.680]   that's what's really taking all the time is DiscReadWrite.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.120]   Well, I got that Turbo H.264 Turbo card from Elgato.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   So if you combine that with tests.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.240]   I'll do some tests with that
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.360]   because we know that like when we're doing compression,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.840]   the fastest way to do compression
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.720]   is from one raid to another.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.200]   You know, so the files are on one raid,
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.960]   where they have to go is on another raid.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.720]   ReadWriteSpeed is a huge deal with video compression.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.240]   I'll give you some benchmark tests
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.320]   comparing it to a non SSD conversion.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.440]   And that H.264 card does seem to speed things up quite a bit,
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.400]   at least on the Mac Mini I noticed.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.720]   'Cause I'm making a home theater Mac Mini.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.280]   So I'll give you some benchmarks on that.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.360]   The thing is when, you know, I have about 60 gigs available
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.960]   because I put all my Lightroom files, you know,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.200]   I had 3000, I had 50 year 60 gigs of photos.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.720]   I just put that on an external drive.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.200]   And you know, with Firewire 800, it's fast.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.080]   It's pretty fast.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.240]   I'm really starting to experiment with this idea
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.120]   of not having everything on the left.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.040]   'Cause right now I have 320 and I'm always full
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.800]   and I'm kind of like, you know, I'm gonna have to give this up.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.640]   Get it off there.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.840]   And just put on what I need, have external drives
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.000]   that I carry around with it that are backed up.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.840]   - Yep.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.680]   - That's what I'm gonna do.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.880]   So I'm gonna go to China with this thing.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.120]   And you'll be watching over my shoulder.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.600]   And what I'll do is I'll digitize each day.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.680]   60 gigs is enough for my two weeks in China anyway.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.680]   But then I'll move off what I need to onto the external drives.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.720]   I do that anyway for backup.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.560]   I bring two of those Western digital pocket drives,
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.880]   the passports, and I copy to both of them.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.840]   Now they're USB, they're not Firewire.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.640]   - You know, the Lucina has one gigs.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.440]   - Or one terabytes.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.640]   - I have a one terabyte, let's see, but it's not exactly.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.480]   - It's a rugged portable.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.320]   They have a little one.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.160]   - Oh, they have that rugged one.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.000]   - We love the rugs.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.160]   - Is it Firewire 800?
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   - It is, it's Firewire.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.000]   - Oh, but that's what I'm gonna do.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   - I think it's 800 USB 400 and--
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.480]   - And Esada.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.320]   - Esada, I think.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.840]   - Yeah, I bought an external, that's what I have,
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.920]   the Lucie terabyte in the heavy duty aluminum case.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.080]   There's one there, I buy a lot of those, I love those.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.680]   And they have Esada on them.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.320]   Oh, and I know they had a portable.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.920]   - Oh, the rugs, we, the passports we've had
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.800]   a lot of failures with.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.640]   So we don't use them.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.800]   - Yeah, I figure they're a throwaway drive, right?
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.280]   - So, but the, we have had, we've had ports burn out of the,
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.920]   but you know, you gotta understand how I use them.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.320]   You know, I mean, I use them rough.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.760]   So ports have burned out with the rugged drives,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.680]   but we love them.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.800]   I have, I typically carry three.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.440]   - 500 gig is only 147 bucks.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.200]   - Well, it's 160 for the one terabyte.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.040]   - You're kidding.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   - No, it's 160 dollars for the one terabyte.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.120]   - Oh, yeah, I might have to go there.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.200]   I might have to go there.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.040]   - I need not go, it's your pick.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.040]   - I got a freebie.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.040]   - Go!
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.960]   - Save us some money here.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.560]   - Sometimes the most interesting picks for the ones where,
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.440]   you know, like the day of the morning that we're recording
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.600]   or the day before and thing,
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.280]   and gee, I gotta make sure I find something.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.160]   And then nothing's really calling out to me.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.280]   And then I suddenly slap my forehead and realize,
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.640]   oh, how about that thing you use each and every single morning?
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   (laughing)
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.720]   Is that worthy of recommending?
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.360]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of comics,
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.160]   both like traditional print comics.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.920]   And of course, comics are only published on the web.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.760]   And it's been a cat and mouse game trying to find a good solution
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   to having just a one click access to get all my comics
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.800]   in with one click every single morning.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.080]   There used to be a really great little application for it
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.640]   for the Macintosh that came out a few years ago,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.120]   but they stopped support for it and also it stopped working
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.280]   because you have to collect stuff from dozens and dozens
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.960]   and dozens of different sites.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.480]   Over the past couple months though, a real lifesaver
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.080]   has been a little web application.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.480]   It's a, it's called the Dark Gate comic slipper.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.080]   Don't wait a minute, say that in the Dark Gate comic slipper?
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.520]   I should probably use the voice.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.120]   The Dark Gate comic slipper.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.560]   Slipper.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.720]   Slipper.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.600]   It's at darkgate.net/comic.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.080]   What it does is it just gives you a list
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.560]   of pretty much every single comic strip
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.400]   that's available on the web.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   I mean, I have never heard of a strip somewhere
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.960]   that did not turn out to be on this list.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.440]   And they keep expanding it as they come across new ones.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.480]   You just click the checkboxes of every single strip
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.000]   that you actually want to have.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.280]   And it will simply present that actual strip
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.560]   as part of this continuous scrolling comics page
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.880]   all on one page.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.240]   It'll deposit a cookie in your web browser
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.960]   so that from that point onward,
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.440]   you just simply go darkgate.net/comic
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.040]   and it will simply download every single comic strip
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.680]   that you're subscribed to that morning
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.600]   and again, present it in one big long scrolling window.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.040]   So you don't have to maintain tabs for six year,
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.720]   for 50 or 60 different sites.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.800]   You don't have to remember which ones have RSS feeds,
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.840]   which ones do not.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.680]   Which ones do not.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.240]   It actually supports a lot of,
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.880]   I don't know what Mojo they've got going on.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.400]   I'm sure that they're doing a lot of Python
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.400]   that simply does it get on the website that hosts the strip
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.120]   and figures out which file in that page
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.080]   is actually the comic strip and then bust it out.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   But I don't really care how it works.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.080]   It's the difference between being able to read
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.440]   a lot of these strips and not really being able
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.120]   to remember that I like them so much.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.240]   I remember pvponline.com.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.560]   I remember Daniel Corsado's Girls with Slingshots.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.440]   There may be one or two others that I will just simply
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.400]   remember if I don't have access to darkgate.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.720]   But for real comic-watching action,
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.800]   it's darkgate or it's nothing.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.080]   If as a matter of fact--
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.560]   - They even have Barney Google and Andy Cap.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.560]   - Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.560]   - PVP online.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.120]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.240]   I can know you're in the 21st century.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.440]   - Broom Hilda.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.040]   - Exactly.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.640]   Actually, still, see that's commitment.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.440]   When you have these comic strip curators
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.440]   who keep working on their strip 30 years after they're dead.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   You know?
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.720]   - This is a long list.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.840]   This is huge.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.640]   - It will take you like a good five or 10 minutes
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.040]   to even if you can put off the list all in one page
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.240]   to make it easier to navigate, easier to make your selections.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240]   If I were to ask for one performance feature,
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.360]   it would be that please have the alphabetized list
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.640]   go from column to column.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.160]   Instead of--
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.600]   All the A's are like--
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.320]   If you go from left to right across four or five columns,
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.360]   oftentimes I forget when I'm setting up a brand new machine
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.760]   to work with darkgate, I don't have the right.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.680]   I've missed over a certain strip
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.080]   because I didn't expect it to be alphabetically where it was.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:45.120]   I also wish it were possible to simply log in to this site
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.120]   and access my list wherever I am.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.560]   Every time I set up a new machine,
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.720]   I have to spend 10 minutes again checking all the strips
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.960]   that I remember that I want.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.040]   But this is also a good chance for me to recommend a strip
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.080]   that I think our listeners were interested in.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.720]   There's a strip called Apple Geeks.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.480]   And he has--
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.840]   It shows you this artist's writer team's commitment
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.320]   to their strip that they don't simply sell this URL
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320]   to some sort of commercial site
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.960]   because that is an awesome URL.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:18.800]   It is applegeeks.com that hosts the strip.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.400]   And of course you can also get it through darkgate.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.880]   But it's a strip about some mostly teenage kids
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.440]   and their technological adventures.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.680]   The two central figures is sort of a young inventor
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.600]   by the name of Hawk who builds an Android girl named Eve.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.720]   Of course, my dream too.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.400]   Of course.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.680]   With the feeling that Eve is going to be his girlfriend,
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.880]   but of course Eve is like decides to go her own way.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.600]   But the cool thing is that Hawk is like a huge, huge fan
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.920]   of everything that Apple does.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.720]   And so Eve is built completely from Apple hardware
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.160]   and Apple software.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.240]   This is quite beautiful.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.400]   I mean, he doesn't color as well as--
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.840]   I just have to say that the artist Muhammad Hawk--
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.720]   damn, this guy can draw.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.120]   I mean, every single full color page
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.600]   is just an absolute delight.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.920]   I don't know if he's actually-- he's also
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.120]   publishing a paper version.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.000]   But every now and then, you'll have a full page piece of art
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.560]   that looks like the cover of a comic book.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.840]   And that is as good a treat as three weeks worth of Dunesbury.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.520]   Just looking at this piece of artwork
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.840]   that simply appears in your comic slipper page.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.920]   So I mean, it was the name applegeeks.com-- applegeeks
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.720]   that attracted to me.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.320]   And I first saw it in the list of Subscribable comics
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.600]   on the servers.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.720]   So I can't recommend Applegeeks enough.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.880]   I can also not recommend the comic slipper page enough.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.320]   Again, every single day starts with--
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.120]   my first conscious act after pulling my MacBook off the night
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.040]   stand into bed is to check on the email
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.280]   and see if the world has ended while I was asleep.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.160]   The second thing is to hit this link
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.400]   and start reading my comics.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.320]   You're going to be sad because, of course, as you've
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.200]   promoted this, we've taken it down completely.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200]   I was like, oh, I'm going to check out Applegeeks.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   I can't get there.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.040]   We've taken two sites down with one, Andy Inako.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.400]   It's a powerful, powerful man.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.080]   You got that, got that, Amazon.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:11.680]   You're next.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.320]   Actually, it's the Twit Army that is so powerful.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.440]   The reason that happens, by the way,
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.720]   for those of you listening on audio,
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.240]   is we also stream the live recording sessions of this
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.160]   and all of our shows at live.twit.tv.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.720]   So you could tune in every Tuesday.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.840]   We do it at 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.240]   It's 11 a.m. Pacific time, 1,800 UTC.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.480]   And watch Andy and Scott and Alex and me just sit around
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.320]   and gab, frankly.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.240]   And it's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.120]   Watch us take down sites, bemoan the lack of--
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.560]   It turns out that websites aren't designed to handle 2,000
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.360]   people at the same time.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.560]   No, in fact, very few are.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.480]   It's really interesting.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.120]   Whenever we plug a site, I'm starting
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.400]   to get a sense of this.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.080]   Most sites, 90% of sites, just boom.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.360]   And it's only the big ones, like Amazon, where you can go
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.280]   and everybody can go there.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.760]   Because they're designed for this.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.320]   They're designed to handle all this traffic.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   I mean, it doesn't take very many people.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.840]   We usually have-- the early morning shows 2, 3,000.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.480]   And especially if they're graphically oriented.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.120]   If there's a lot of graphics like with Apple Geeks,
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.280]   which is now running again.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.120]   Look at this cover.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.680]   There's the previous issue.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.800]   But they're going to be like--
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.960]   So thanks for the man with Bill.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.760]   Sorry about that.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.960]   You've heard of Slash.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.000]   You've heard of Dig.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.800]   Well, welcome to the tweet army.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.280]   Hey, want to thank you, Andy and I
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.240]   go for being here today.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.480]   As always, he's the man.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.000]   Andy, you can read him in the Chicago Sun Times
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.800]   and also on his own website.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.080]   C-W-O-B, Celestial Waste of Banwith.com.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.320]   And we love having you on the show.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:44.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.360]   As always, it's a slice, Leo.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.160]   It's a slice.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.520]   And I wish you were a slice of pizza,
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.120]   but that's just because it's lunchtime.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.840]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.600]   He is the Pixelcore man.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.240]   You can see the podcasts at Pixelcore.tv.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.840]   And including all his NAB coverage.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.600]   Yeah, it turned out to be really great coverage.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.640]   Can't wait to see that.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.440]   And it wasn't just me.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.840]   It was Brian Gary and Mark Spencer from Macbreak Studio
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.680]   was there because that's kind of their area.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.320]   And so they did some of the episodes.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.480]   And we just had so much fun.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.120]   So you can also just find that at Macbreak, the video Macbreak
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.640]   on iTunes as well.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.280]   Search for-- yes, search for--
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:20.760]   It's Macbreak.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.640]   --for Pixelcore on iTunes or Macbreak on iTunes
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.560]   or tweet on iTunes.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.920]   You'll get all of that stuff.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.000]   And Pixelcore.com is a place to go for.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.360]   His global adventure is a--
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.680]   his guild of multimedia artists.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.240]   Pixelcore.com, P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:37.920]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:38.960]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.720]   All of our shows are on Twitch.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.480]   You can watch us on live.twit.tv or go to your iTunes
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.680]   or Zoom store and search for the word "twit," T-W-I-T.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:52.640]   We also have an audio stream.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.400]   Houdini7 was telling me, I can't remember what it was.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.240]   It's something like, how many was it?
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:59.680]   20, 10,000, 20,000 people have downloaded the Twitch.am
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.760]   application for the iPhone.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.040]   That you just-- it's actually really cool.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.480]   You press the button and you can listen.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.320]   You use that, Randy?
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.600]   Listen, it comes right up.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:10.640]   And we stream everything on audio as well at Twitch.am/listen
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.120]   or use the iPhone store free application, Twitch.am.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.600]   All of our shows are absolutely free when we thank.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.040]   Our sponsors for making that possible.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.840]   And of course, the people who contribute to the Twitch
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:27.760]   network, many thousands of you who have sent in your $2
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   once a month, it's less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.400]   And you get all this great content.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.040]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.160]   We'll see you next time, another Mac break.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.040]   Peace, bro.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
