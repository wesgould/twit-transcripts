[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.

[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.000]   This is Twit.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.960]   Bandwidth for MacBrige Weekly is provided by cashfly
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.160]   at CACHEFLY.com.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.120]   This is MacBrige Weekly, episode 15 for November 14, 2006.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.200]   Jack is a Mac.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:47.920]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.520]   This is Alex, and we are--
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.360]   I think this is the first time MacBrige has--
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.600]   MacBrige Weekly has been recorded in the same room.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720]   I don't think we've done this before.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   Very first time.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.080]   I thought you did it at the podcast expo.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.840]   That was twin.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.720]   Oh, no.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.080]   That wasn't twin.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   Didn't you do one in the back room?
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   Did we do one in the back?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680]   Maybe that was an eyeliner.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.760]   Were you guys wearing tuxes like to end?
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.680]   It's all mixed together.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680]   I don't know.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.120]   It's just all this big mush of lots and lots.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.760]   This is my third podcast in the last two days,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.440]   and so I'm getting kind of confused.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720]   And the quality never flags.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.120]   Actually, the quality went up because we
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.320]   have these new cool microfist.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.520]   These mics are really cool.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.040]   Oh, man.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   I'm going to show you some video of this, Alex.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.760]   OK, so Merlin-- OK, so just so you know who's here, of course.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   We've got Jon Foster.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.600]   And this is my very first time on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   This is.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760]   This is Jon Foster's Virgin Void.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   Has he been through this making machine yet?
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.360]   We didn't want to talk about this.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.400]   What you know about this thing?
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680]   The thing is, is that I was one of the guys who
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.720]   did Mac Break Minutes back in the beta alpha pilot of Mac Break.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880]   And he's so--
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.520]   So it's a return.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.200]   It's the return.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.560]   It's the return of Jon Foster.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   Maybe I'll do a Mac Break Minute in the minute
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.000]   some time during the episode.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.080]   I think that maybe we'll do that.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.240]   Well, we're threatening to bring Mac Break Minutes back.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.120]   We should, because I love doing it.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.480]   Well, if people want to have Mac Break Minutes back,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.600]   and you don't know what they are, they
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960]   were like little one to two minute tips that we would do
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.880]   that would come out every day.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.640]   There's video ones.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   There were little video tips.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   I think it's great.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.080]   So if people like that, they should go to the forum on Twitch
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120]   or in the little comment area.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.680]   And they should tell us that they want it.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.400]   And then we'll make a decision.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.560]   You're going to require people to give us a compliment
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   in order to make the change.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.120]   They know they need to say, oh, you need to do it.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, and you have to compliment Merlin on his hair.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.680]   Seriously, you guys.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.880]   You're so great.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   So Merlin's here, of course.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.320]   Leo is not-- Leo's in Toronto.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.240]   Leo's over that much.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.760]   And he's--
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.480]   If we aim the camera at Leo, be that way.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.040]   You know, they can't see the camera, though.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.600]   That's the problem.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.040]   No, no, no.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.680]   But this footage will be somewhere.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.240]   I'm sure.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.680]   OK, we'll put it up somewhere.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   Somewhere, somewhere special.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   So also, we've got Merlin Mann here.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.240]   And Merlin is moving his camera all over the set.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   So-- oh, he's in it to me.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.040]   OK, I got it.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.520]   I got it.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360]   Right, yeah.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.240]   How's it going, Alex?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.040]   It's going very, very well.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.080]   So what happened here is you may notice
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.040]   that the sound quality is a little bit better than Skype.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.400]   I mean, possibly.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.800]   For some of you, you may not like it as much.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.120]   But--
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.280]   We can still just--
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   People are going to miss the digital clipping.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.600]   Can you add that in?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   I can add the--
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120]   It's got something about the iPhone or any of it.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.800]   It drives it?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.800]   So how do I stop this thing?
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.300]   Hold on.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.320]   I'll just hand it back to you.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.760]   Jane, how do I stop this crazy thing?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.920]   So anyway, so yeah, this is kind of nice.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.040]   What happened was, is that we've been slowly building up
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.200]   our capacity here and here in the office in San Francisco.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800]   And so we got these PR40s that we were using on this weekend
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.000]   media yesterday.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.760]   Literally, all this stuff showed up.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.240]   The PR40 showed up like a week ago.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   And then the rest of the high-all equipment
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.840]   showed up yesterday morning.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   So there was this mad rush.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.680]   We were drilling holes in desks and doing all kinds
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.000]   of crazy stuff yesterday.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.240]   Getting ready for this weekend media.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.440]   And we shot this.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.840]   And then I figured Scott was having a little hard time.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.440]   I mean, Scott was having a hard time.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.480]   He's down at oh high.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.680]   And he's just doing some work down there.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.600]   So scheduling it was a little more difficult.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.280]   And the rest of us are here.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.040]   So I figured--
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.200]   Take an advantage of these cool microphones.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.760]   Exactly.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.360]   The PR40 is a microphone if you didn't know.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.800]   PR40, it's a high-all PR40.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.760]   And they're pretty nifty.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.680]   We got six of them.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   But we're only using three.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.840]   I was thinking of giving Merlin two.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.800]   Because he's being stereo and stereo.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.600]   Yeah, Merlin could just go back and forth.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.480]   And I didn't want to--
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.080]   Not the rest of us.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.520]   But I had to put my frenetic movement.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.480]   Yeah, but I thought that Merlin might need it.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.320]   So anyway, we've got a bunch of fun news for today.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.480]   Top of the list, Apple is setting up
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.560]   a deal to be able to connect your iPod to the AV for while
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.400]   you're on a flight.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.520]   So they made the deal with a handful of folks here.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.720]   I'm not sure--
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.080]   Air France, Continental, Delta, Emirates, KLM, and United
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120]   to deliver iPod integration.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.000]   So what do you think?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.720]   Is that something that you're interested in?
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.240]   If I flew more often, I happen to be on the no-fly list.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.880]   So it's difficult for me to get around.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.080]   Are you really--
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.960]   You're like John Madden.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   You've got to have a bus.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.240]   Well, I have to go to the airport extra early.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.800]   And the thing is, I don't know if it was me that put me
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.400]   on the no-fly.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.960]   Are you saving serious?
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.840]   I'm serious.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.720]   I don't know if it was me that put me on the no-fly list.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880]   But everybody whose name, John Foster,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.920]   has the exact same problem.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   Either because of me--
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.640]   There was some John Foster that's a very bad boy.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.720]   It was probably me.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   I probably looked off to the wrong person.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.760]   Did you get the wrong one?
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.960]   You opened up a can of Cori on this.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.480]   Exactly.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.560]   I know what the deal is.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.000]   I actually just-- I think it's pretty funny
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.760]   that I'm a threat to my country.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.240]   Now, I was told by someone--
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.720]   It's in a style.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.800]   I was told by someone in the quote unquote, no.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.200]   That it's easy to get you on to the checklist.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.640]   But it's very almost impossible.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.200]   They didn't have an apparatus.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.640]   At least in 2002 or 2003, they didn't have an apparatus
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.480]   to actually take you off the list.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.640]   There was only a way to add you on.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   And they just didn't bother.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.120]   So what you never want to do is make someone upset.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120]   I travel a lot.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.080]   I fly on an airport two to four times a week a month.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.560]   And I'm always the nicest guy.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.040]   You don't have any questions.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.880]   Well, I'm pretty nice now, but it doesn't make any difference.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.360]   Now, do you fly a lot?
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   You know, I fly a fair amount.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.480]   I'm flying more.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.240]   And I'll tell you what.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.360]   I'm excited about this just for my own completely selfish
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.120]   reasons.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.960]   I do have-- I finally dropped the cash
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.000]   to get an iPod video.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.960]   And something I always imagined I would never get.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.520]   Because it's like, who's going to sit around and watch that?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   But I love it.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.800]   I do.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   This makes it even better.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.400]   And I got to tell you, I also made that decision.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.680]   So I figured this time around, unlike during the boom,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.200]   when I was scattering my flying over mini flights,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.080]   over-- excuse me-- over mini carriers.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.520]   I decided this time, I'm going to pick one carrier.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.720]   I'm going to try and do the whole mileage thing.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.560]   And I went with United.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   And luckily, United is one of the people doing this.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.960]   So I'm very excited.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.460]   I know.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.440]   I'm with US Air.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   So now I'm--
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.000]   I've got that thing where you get that--
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.360]   where you get the upgrade to the extra little seedage.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.200]   Are you golden?
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   No, I've got the thing where you automatically
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   get upgraded into the first class.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.600]   Not into fucking god, no, nothing like that.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   Where you get these slightly less--
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.280]   Economy plus.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Orthopedic killing.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.520]   That's exactly right, Economy plus.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   But at any rate-- so I don't know the details of this.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.680]   I don't know when this is going to roll out.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.040]   I don't know if it's going to be in every class.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.760]   But I think the idea of this is very exciting.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.680]   And what's interesting to me is it's just orthogonally.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.760]   You're seeing so much more now with airlines
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   where they're going, oh, you know, well,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.640]   you've got to bring your own sandwich and bring your own coffee
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.400]   or blah, blah.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.440]   And I think it's kind of intriguing
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.360]   that you can bring your entertainment.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.440]   And you can bring your own movie.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   I love it.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.760]   I love it.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.840]   Because someone who has my video iPod, I mean,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.440]   there's two places that I really
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.240]   want to be able to connect my video iPod that I haven't
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.760]   been able to.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.120]   One is in the plane and the other one
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.440]   is in my stationary bike at my gym.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.200]   I actually-- here's the worst part is that I actually
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.360]   got a hold of the--
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.120]   I go to this kind of a Fru Fru Jim.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.840]   And then I'm in the kind of the Fru Fru area of the Fru Fru
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.640]   Jim.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.480]   Economy plus.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.400]   You don't know my-- it's kind of like the first class
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   of working out, you know?
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.720]   Because I do enough of it.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.120]   You know?
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   They actually ride the bike for you.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.200]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.680]   And I just sit there and just go, oh, anyway.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.320]   So I got my own little--
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   each one of the bikes has its own little TV.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.480]   And I actually got a hold of the guy who does maintenance,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.280]   who manages all the stuff and like
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.480]   had this long conversation with him.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.880]   OK, here's the deal.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.080]   You need-- and I told him, I would actually
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.000]   buy the connections he needs.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.200]   I'll go to Radio Shack and get you what you need,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.240]   so that you can have little RCA inputs right here,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.200]   so that I can watch my iPod when I come in.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.520]   And I'll just put it in these two bikes.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.680]   And I'll know that when I come, it works in these two bikes.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.960]   You know?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.240]   You're like Frank Sinatra.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.720]   You walk in there and you've got your own bike
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.000]   with your own RCA jacks on it?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.360]   Well, it's not my bike.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.440]   But I want to put the RCA jacks in there.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.760]   So he was actually going to look to see if he could do it.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.360]   But if he can't, I'm actually going to put them in there,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.440]   just because when I'm bike--
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.800]   I know I sound like a high roller.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   But I'm going to spend my 15 bucks so that they're there.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.240]   Because I spend about four to five hours a week
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.800]   in front of that bike, in front of the same screen.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.280]   People at all can't see this, and they can't appreciate this.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   But Alex is huge.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.360]   He's punked.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.320]   The guy is ripped.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.920]   I mean, he's sitting here.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   He took the top.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.160]   He took his jacket from his dinner jacket off
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.920]   and his cumber bun and his shirt and his bow tie.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.280]   And he's huge.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.120]   What can I say?
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.920]   What can I say?
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.080]   Can you believe this guy?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.120]   Unfortunately, I'm trying to move the hugeness
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.720]   from my stomach to my chest.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.240]   That's why I'm there all the time.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.760]   So I'm there all the time.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.440]   I'm finding--
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.080]   Hugeness readjustment.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   I'm finding that as I get older, my metabolism
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.800]   is getting slower.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   So I'm trying to get back into shape.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.720]   Because every time I get on Mac break, I get frustrated.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.440]   I'm like, I see myself on video.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.640]   Or if I get on tech TV, and I'm like,
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.320]   she's going to man girdle like me.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.360]   Yeah, it's very slimming.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.400]   I'm thinking of that.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.840]   It was either that or just I was going
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.440]   to try to develop sickness or something that caused me
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.840]   to have a little way of--
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.040]   It's kind of wasting disease.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.560]   I was thinking about that.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   You know, I just couldn't do anything
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080]   that would actually require me to throw up or not eat
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.520]   or anything.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.680]   I just want like a tape worm.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   I was thinking like, you know, I could just swallow--
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.000]   Just get an eye tape worm.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.200]   We should find out that's something that I think--
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.600]   So back to the story though.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.160]   This is great.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.480]   And I mean, this is too quicky, little rat holes here.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.080]   First of all, back to--
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.840]   I mean, like, so Leon and I were talking about this.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.520]   A few podcast, net cast discussions ago.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.040]   But, you know, Air Canada had been doing something pretty cool.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.320]   They didn't have-- they had a USB jack.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.240]   Yeah, but you-- where?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.080]   So coming back from me coming back from Toronto
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.160]   a month and a half ago.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.440]   Yeah, I was on-- I don't-- I want to say an A319,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.520]   but I don't think that's right.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.920]   But it was on one of these.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.080]   It was totally tricked out.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.400]   It was a very new jet.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.720]   And it had a-- has a touchscreen,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.080]   like the JetBlue kind of TV--
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.280]   Oh, Virgin.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.840]   --and totally touchscreen.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.160]   No, Virgin doesn't do--
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.960]   No, Virgin doesn't do--
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.440]   This is the American--
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.520]   This is our camera.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.400]   This is our camera.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.880]   And it had a USB jack.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.200]   And it had-- it had-- it had-- had AC power under the seat.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.680]   So what did it do with the USB jack?
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.560]   Oh, charge.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.520]   It just charges.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.360]   It just has power.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.920]   But-- OK.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.800]   So I'm just saying, like, so I-- I don't know.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.760]   I think this is really intriguing.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.600]   Because I want the USB jack to log into the--
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.320]   Well, there's a part of me that wonders whether--
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.760]   part of this is the JetBlueization of--
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   of more airlines.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.560]   Because what, in my opinion, if you could summarize JetBlue
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.160]   down to one statement, it's that they started caring
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.640]   about the stuff that people who fly care about.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   But what I think the other thing is,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.080]   is they cared about things that are one cost and not
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.840]   expensive to do over and over and over again.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   So food is expensive to do over and over and over again.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   That's millions and millions--
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   And food slows down.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.160]   I mean, most important thing is it slows down the amount
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.320]   of time your birds in the air.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.960]   So both by the cations.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.480]   By the amount it slows you down and the amount it costs
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.080]   the airline to provide it.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.800]   We're talking about millions and millions and millions
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.300]   of dollars.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.360]   Whereas simply adding some other features to the--
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.160]   a couple extra features or a couple extra things
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   to the seat is a one time cost.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.640]   It's not a recurring cost.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.400]   And I think that being able to add all that
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.640]   is really easy for an airline.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.080]   When I flew a Virgin to Africa, and it
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.720]   was an amazing experience with this little--
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.640]   had this little controller and had little games.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.320]   And I could start the movie whenever I wanted to.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.640]   And there was like 80 movies on it.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.600]   Is this coach?
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.520]   This is coach.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:09.960]   Wow.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.720]   And when the Virgin says, your coach
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.560]   will be like first class or whatever, the seats are smaller.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   But the screen is awesome.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   I think it would be really amazing if they had couch class.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.440]   They do.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.800]   That's called first class in British Airways.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.320]   It would be like a dorm, like a common room.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.360]   You can just kind of wander around.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.680]   Everyone's got the same TV.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.640]   There's, if you want a beer, get your own beer.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   That's a great idea.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.400]   That's like the dude class.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.960]   This also brings us back to one other thing, though,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.080]   which is our crazy speculation actually.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.520]   I think it was one of the first--
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.760]   one of these ideas.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.440]   The whole idea of do we think we'll
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.080]   see Apple moving into airports at some point?
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.240]   It may be like kiosks or via--
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.560]   do you remember that conversation?
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.920]   The conversation about the whole idea
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.760]   was based on something editorial or a blog entry,
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.200]   rather, on the Macworld site, speculating on the idea
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.680]   that wouldn't that be an interesting move for Apple
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.920]   to move into airports?
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   And to be able to obviously sell things
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.440]   like power cords and things like that.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.960]   But also, with a fairly modest kiosk,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.800]   you could be selling minis or rather nanos.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.440]   You could be selling--
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.880]   You know, they were selling-- when
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.680]   we were at the portable media expo,
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.480]   there was actually a vending machine for iPods.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.880]   And all that stuff was-- there's like a big vending machine.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   One of those at Macy's.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.600]   It means we feel like I'm on the Jetsons.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.440]   It is so weird.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.080]   You just look at it.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.040]   You're like, I can't believe they're selling $400 items
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.440]   in the--
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   Right next to a sandwich.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.360]   And my iPod smells like cheese.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.760]   I hit the wrong button.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.440]   I hit the wrong button.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.280]   $400 sandwich!
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.160]   I can't get lost on this.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.360]   It's Angeline Lilly.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.040]   And I have to admit, I would have invested heavily
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.440]   in power adapters if they kept on--
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.320]   if they had them at the airports, because I forget my power
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.360]   adapter about twice a year.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.560]   And I have like 60 to--
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.760]   Oh, it's such a common thing.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.040]   Everybody is forever forgetting their power supplies.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.440]   And also, I guess I'm just getting at this--
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.000]   I mean, so the speculation that we were talking about last time
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   was, well, would they ever do this?
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.200]   Because increasingly, I think that
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.480]   was right after one of the scares.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.440]   And yes, it was after the whole jail scare.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.720]   And so everybody's like, oh gosh, you can't bring things on.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.920]   But that's kind of calmed down.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.840]   And it seems to me that the airlines like having
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.880]   a docile passenger.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.080]   So if you can have somebody who's got their little screen
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   to play with, they're going to be left to their own devices.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   I don't know.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.800]   It seems like a good move for Apple to get into that.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.680]   Well, and I think we did talk about earlier
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.000]   that they now have a power adapter for your plane seats.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.680]   And so you're going to throw your Mac.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.840]   For the Mac, what's the call it?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.600]   The Mac.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   The Mac.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.120]   Mac.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.600]   Mac power or whatever.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.120]   Safe.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.920]   Mac safe.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   Mac safe.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   There you go.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.280]   So which is really, really good because a lot of people
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.440]   don't know is that some of these airlines just hide that
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.880]   in almost all of their seats.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.640]   Like US Airways has in every seat, coach or not.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   I just was on a flight two days ago coming back from Pittsburgh.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.360]   And so it was the--
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.200]   so it's something that you can definitely--
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.160]   I would highly suggest that.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.640]   That and many batteries.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.000]   Wow.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.640]   So what's the time frame for this?
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.160]   As usual, I didn't finish reading the article.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.960]   So when is this supposed to happen?
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.800]   Next year.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.480]   Next year?
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.320]   Not soon enough.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.560]   So we have 70% of--
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.640]   Mid 2007.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.160]   So we have 70% of cars being shipped with iPod connectors.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.000]   And we have--
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   What?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.560]   30% of airplanes.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.640]   What did you get that?
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.920]   That was the stat on the--
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.160]   Yeah, the stat was 70%.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.560]   But I think they were iPod ready.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.600]   And I think that means different things
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.280]   to different car companies.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.000]   It means Ethan's Jack for Chrysler.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.640]   It means stereo, stereo, mini, Athena.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.040]   It means plug it into your BMW or Mercedes.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.120]   So some of them are like, really, you put your iPod in
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.280]   and you can control it.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.280]   So as you're driving--
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:45.640]   Wow.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.840]   If you use the control wheel, it--
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.400]   or the steering wheel is the control wheel.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   So as you turn left, the volume goes down.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.320]   And if you turn right, the volume goes up.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.800]   And as you break, that's the next song.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.840]   And it's going to accelerate.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.000]   So there's a modal switch that you could just go between change
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.600]   direction of car and change volume of iPod.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.120]   So--
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.920]   I love this song.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.320]   But I do have to say that the--
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.240]   what we've had to deal with up until now is a lot of these--
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.800]   a lot of these cars have--
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.600]   they don't have cassette decks anymore.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.320]   So they have CDs.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.840]   And so the only way to interface them
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.640]   with those stupid radio transmitters, which are cute.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.880]   But if you're in a city--
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.960]   It's like Mr. Microphone.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.760]   You know, it just sounds like gas.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.200]   The thing is, if you get one that works with your car,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.800]   it works really well.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.720]   But you have to be prepared to do trial and error.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   I had that--
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.960]   I had that riff in for--
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.760]   I did something that I probably shouldn't say on the radio
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.880]   that works really, really well.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.000]   Or not on the radio, so go ahead.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.200]   Don't run on the radio, yeah, there we go.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.920]   And so I tried something that was actually extremely effective.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.200]   There's this little thing on the web,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.320]   and I have to try to find it that we use for seminars.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.640]   That is, it's a little box, and it projects FM for 150 feet.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.400]   And you can tune what channel you want it to.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.920]   And it's much more powerful.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.680]   It's a little traveling public idea.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.000]   It might or it might not be against all kinds of FCC
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.600]   regulations.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.000]   So I tried it for a trip, and it was awesome.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.480]   So you hook my little iPod into there, and man,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.560]   I got very clear signal.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.960]   Now, what's cool was, is so did everybody else
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.920]   as I was driving down the highway.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.560]   You could make people listen to Judas Priest British Steel
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.760]   in every car around you.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.080]   It was very effective.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.880]   It's like a little kit that you have to put together.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.040]   You can't actually--
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.680]   Break in the law.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.160]   I'll break in the law.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.880]   Break in the law, 150 feet as I'm driving down the road 6-5.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.560]   That's federal, dude.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.520]   I would be careful with that.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.680]   Oh, I know it's federal.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.520]   It was a test.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.280]   It was a test.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.840]   It was a proof of concept.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.720]   It was a proof of concept.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.800]   And I don't even think I have the thing anymore,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.360]   but I think if you put a sticker on the back of your car
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.160]   that says, keep up, and you get to rock out.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.680]   I like--
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.400]   I wanted to put a little thing in the mic.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.720]   Welcome to WCAR, my car.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.560]   So anyway, if you're all out there,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.080]   if you do a search for FM transmitter,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.800]   you'll probably find it.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   It's like 30 bucks.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.920]   I had the Griffin one where you strap it onto the top.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   And it's all static.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.400]   And you've got to find the right FM station or everything.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.120]   It makes it crazy.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.280]   It works great when you're in Nebraska,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.680]   because there's no other radio waves.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680]   It's just when you're in the city.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.720]   Is there anywhere else?
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.360]   Because you're competing with everything else.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.240]   Part of the problem is that--
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.080]   And it changes, right?
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.920]   You've got to change it.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.160]   FM is a very difficult frequency.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.080]   You have to have a lot of power to make it work.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.880]   And you have to be pretty much right on.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.520]   And so with these new digital tunes FM, it's that frequency.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.160]   And so if the Griffin thing is off by just a--
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.600]   then that's a technical--
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.600]   Well, the other problem--
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.440]   And then--
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.400]   No, but it's digital.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.880]   It's not fuzzy.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.440]   So if you had the old SafeCracker FM,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.960]   then you could just dial it in.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.480]   And it'd be--
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160]   [SQUEALING]
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   What's-- maybe we should ask the kids.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.880]   Ask the kids to come to the--
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.600]   Twit.tv.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.880]   Come to Twit.tv for this episode.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.760]   What a week, what is this episode?
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.120]   What is this?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.760]   15, record--
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.600]   This is number 15.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.040]   15.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.480]   Number 15.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.600]   And tell us what is your favorite way of getting your iPod
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.320]   onto--
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.720]   Tell us what works.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.760]   Because I gave up a long time ago.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   But I rented a Dards Charger in LA.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.600]   Like a Dukes of Hazard car?
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.640]   No, it's a newer one.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.120]   Did it have the flag on it?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.920]   [SQUEALING]
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   Anyway, so the--
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.680]   I'm 40.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.320]   How do you do dukes?
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   I just love that somehow they manage to get a character
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.160]   on TV named Enos.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.200]   It's still funny.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.000]   So you got a charger.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.480]   So you got a lot of charger.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.920]   I got a lot of charger.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.960]   It's pretty cool looking.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.720]   It's kind of a mixture of the dude.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.040]   Dukes and a tank.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.520]   Oh.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.920]   So it was actually a good drive.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.160]   It had some power and everything else.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.720]   But the most important thing is it had an eighth inch jacket.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.840]   It was the first one I had seen of one of these cars
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.280]   that had an eighth inch jacket.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.320]   And it was--
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.120]   I literally-- I looked down.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.600]   And I saw this little eighth inch jack.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.680]   And I literally--
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.200]   It's so mean.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.040]   --immediately popped up.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.800]   I was like--
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.280]   I was like, oh my goodness.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.640]   And I immediately--
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.480]   I have a little palm.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.120]   I have a trio with a-- and I have a GPS.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.280]   And so I immediately--
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.120]   Oh, a little yell out the directions to you?
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.840]   But what I do with it is that--
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   usually I use it now because I'm always lost in LA.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.960]   And so I had this on my--
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.880]   I got my little Tom Tom.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.320]   And I wrote in Radio Shack.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.480]   And it shows me like Radio Shack is 4.8 miles away.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.720]   And I drove straight to Radio Shack.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.880]   And I bought my eighth inch to eighth inch,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.640]   popped it in my headphone, popped it in there.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.440]   And it was crystal clear.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.400]   That is so cool.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.040]   It was crystal clear.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.160]   And then when I changed it, it was another crystal clear
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.660]   song.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.320]   And then I changed it again.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.880]   And you know what's going to happen next?
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.440]   Crystal clear.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.080]   And crystal clear.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.880]   That's so nice.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   And I was just like--
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.000]   and I thought to myself as I was driving happily in a--
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.320]   I was on the 405 going two miles an hour.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.480]   And I didn't care because I had crystal clear music that
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.600]   was of my choice.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.360]   And I thought to myself, radio is truly dead.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.200]   Well, you know, I got to say, I like when I get the cars--
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   this is not very Mackie.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.800]   But I like when I get the cars that have the satellite radio,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.240]   too.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.960]   I like that.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.760]   But the thing that I usually do whenever my wife and I
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.000]   go somewhere and we know we're going to run a car--
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.960]   this is really dorky in 1996.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.160]   But we just always make sure we just burn a few.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.400]   Like I'll do some smart playlists.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.480]   They just burn some mixed discs.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.440]   Another good reason to always take CDs with you whenever
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:14.880]   you go on the road.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.640]   I take blank CDs.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.560]   In your hipster office.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.520]   You should always have your hipster office, which is your--
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.640]   like the hipster PDA, it's your very low-fi office full
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.080]   of extra cards and what have you.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.360]   Actually, blank DVDs work better than CDs
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.720]   because CDs are kind of fragile.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.200]   They take so long to burn.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.800]   No, they don't.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.640]   They don't take anymore.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.160]   No, they don't.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.640]   Yeah, they do.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.200]   No, they don't.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.440]   They take too long to burn.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   They take too long to burn.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.840]   They don't.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.280]   No, no, the reason why you should take DVDs and not CDs.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.920]   But you can't play them on the car radio.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.600]   See, Nate?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.680]   See, I was thinking just from a purely, I need to burn this.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   No, no, we're traveling.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.080]   I'll take blank CDs and we'll drive down the one.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.520]   And we'll do it in the car while we're talking.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.200]   Like, oh, we're going to do this on-- or we'll sit in the
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.560]   hotel that night and go, when do we feel like tomorrow?
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.760]   I feel like a little brazilian.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   Next, just for the sake of argument, if you had your
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.240]   incredibly illegal FCC-defying Uber FM device, is that
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.720]   something you could use, potentially in a hotel room as
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.240]   well?
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.080]   Something that's cleft to the vehicle.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.640]   No, no, no.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.240]   It's actually designed to just sit somewhere and
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.720]   forget.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.320]   It's got a big skull and crossbones and a big
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.040]   morning sticker.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   Hard to be taken over the air.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.720]   You just knock Terry Gross off the air.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   Yarn.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   I'd be talking to Terry Gross.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.280]   I'm a pirate.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.480]   And so, yeah, no, it's--
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.080]   Hypothetically, though.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.640]   I don't even know what they make it for.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.480]   I mean, other than do it or do what we do.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.040]   But what we bought it for was we really were doing a
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.600]   seminar in the middle of nowhere where we knew that
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.080]   there was no one that was going to be around and we gave
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.040]   everybody little headphones instead of so they could
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.840]   all listen because it was a big set.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.800]   And so you had 80 people sitting there and it was buying
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.640]   80 little things that they could listen to that were the
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   kind that you're supposed to use.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.600]   So the thing that we did that--
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.440]   The thing that's did that.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.920]   They gave everybody, like in the audience, like Walkman's
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.120]   and played along to it.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.880]   And they probably used something like that that broke
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.080]   the line?
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.720]   Yes.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.240]   Yes.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:58.680]   It's been coined.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.240]   I was breaking the law for the sake of the rock.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   There you go.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.000]   All right.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.680]   We got on something.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.600]   So I want to thank everybody.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.040]   There was a couple people who--
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.280]   Oh gosh, yeah.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.760]   This was kind of fun.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.240]   I got it off 'cause Modo, where did you get it from?
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.320]   Which one are you talking about?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.600]   The iPod Airplane Story.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.720]   Oh, well, that's--
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.560]   Oh, we were already moved on?
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.240]   Yeah, I'm moving on.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.680]   I'm past it.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.400]   Well, if you're with the FCC and you'd like to pick Alex up.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.280]   Hey, shut it.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.640]   So--
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.240]   Everything's not good.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   --all land security, the RIAAA, the FCC.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.560]   So we also had one on--
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.840]   this is digiaudio.blogspot.com.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.600]   And so both-- and I can't--
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.760]   I'm trying to find the name here of who runs this thing.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.960]   But back story?
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.920]   Back story is-- OK, so the back story from last week
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   is that I was complaining about radio.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.400]   That I want to be able to program my iTunes.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.920]   I used to program radio.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.240]   And I wanted to have playlists.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.560]   And so the idea was that I could set up a series of playlists.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.960]   Let's say my hot rotation, my medium rotation,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.080]   my light rotation, all these different rotations.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.000]   And then I could set them up so it would grab one from the hot.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.800]   And the next time it would grab one from the light.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.040]   And I could design how that worked.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.600]   And so here, someone put one together.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.160]   And this is on--
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.240]   once again, digiaudio.blogspot.com.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.520]   And I'm looking for the name of the person who does this.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.800]   And I don't know where it is.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.400]   It doesn't have an IAMA on the page.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.080]   I'm waiting for-- oh, my profile.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.560]   I bet you if I went to my-- oh, Jeff Hankerson.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.360]   So Jeff Hankerson put up a script that actually does
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.960]   something like what I was talking about.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.560]   And also, he wasn't the only one.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.520]   So also-- let me see if I--
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.120]   Chris Harrington, who does a lot of Mac stuff.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.280]   He's got a great site.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.960]   And so Chris also--
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.640]   in No Soap radio, this is--
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.240]   anyway, so localtype.org.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.400]   And I don't know what is--
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.880]   we'll put the URL up on the show notes.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.760]   But so Chris Harrington and Mr. Hankerson put together
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.600]   two different approaches to it, which are very, very good
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.800]   and probably pretty useful, but not exactly what I wanted.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.160]   Well, can you describe what it is they do?
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.600]   I hadn't tried these yet.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.320]   They do random.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.760]   They're using smart playlists.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.200]   It does work.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.720]   It does some kind of fun.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.600]   They use-- they're allowing you--
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.440]   and here's the thing.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.560]   Maybe these guys can go up to Mac Break Weekly
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.720]   and describe this.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.040]   They can put it in the little comments list.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.880]   Because what I didn't get is--
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.760]   and I've realized that what I'm going to need to do
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.920]   is I'm going to record a movie of what I want.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.680]   And I'll kind of draw it out for people
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.920]   so that they can really see it and see if they can reproduce
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.480]   exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.520]   Because it's complicated.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.360]   And I realized that we were arguing so much about whether
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:44.760]   we're talking--
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.120]   --so much work into a single lazy web request.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.920]   But it was awesome.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.080]   I was so impressed that these guys were working on this.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.440]   And so now I want to try to--
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.000]   and maybe it can do it.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.040]   But I went through these.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.000]   I saw them.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.880]   And I went through them.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.360]   And I tried to do them exactly the way
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   that they were described.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.200]   And while they were useful, they would randomly
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.040]   build a smart list.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.320]   The Apple Script one is kind of cool,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.520]   because it literally builds the list from the things
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.280]   that you selected.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.440]   It's got a little interface.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.520]   It's got a little-- wow.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.320]   I mean, it's got a series that's got to--
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   it emulates a wizard by walking you through a series of it.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.480]   A little bit like that.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:22.060]   And so these were both really good tries at what I was looking
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:22.320]   for.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.240]   But unless I'm missing something with both of these,
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   they're still not exactly what I want.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.640]   And I would love if someone figured out
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.360]   how to do that.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.320]   Well, you should definitely make a movie.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.960]   I'm going to make a movie by next week.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.880]   So by next week, we'll announce that I'll have a movie done.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.520]   So that America's web monkeys can help you.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.240]   And Leo, see, the problem is this was my chance.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.400]   I was going to try to make the movie before this episode,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.980]   because this was my chance, because Leo's going to shoot me
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.640]   down.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.080]   So he's going to be like, oh, I can't believe that.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.560]   But I was like, oh, I could talk about it.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   And so I'm going to put up a movie.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.680]   I'll put it up somewhere.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.160]   I'll talk about it next week.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   And I'll let you know where it's at.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.640]   It'll be someone on the Pixel course site.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.960]   That's where I can post.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.320]   But the basic thing is that for those of you listening,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   if you want to keep on playing, is that it really has to--
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.200]   you have to be able to grab the playlists and say,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.080]   I want to go from this playlist to this playlist
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.800]   to this playlist, one to the next.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.960]   I need to be able to control.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.280]   I don't want it randomly grabbing out of all those playlists.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.040]   It doesn't do me any good.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.160]   I wanted to grab the one song from playlist A, one song
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.800]   from playlist B, one song from playlist C. And then--
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.640]   and I can set it up, like, for instance, in a given hour,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.160]   I might want it to hit playlist A two or three times.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.520]   And I want it to randomly grab songs out of playlist A
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.240]   that haven't been played until all of them have been played
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.800]   and then start over again.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.000]   It's kind of like a carousel.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.760]   It's moving from one to the next.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   And what I wanted to play--
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.360]   --is to play all of those songs.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.320]   And what you really want to do is you don't want it to actually
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.560]   play-- if you're doing radio, people used to pay.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.560]   I actually wrote a program that did this.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.680]   So I wrote it in hypercard that would actually--
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.360]   So this is why you kept saying radio.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.400]   You just mean in the sense that you
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.720]   don't want it to repeat it in an hour or something like that.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.960]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.080]   In radio, this was how we programmed a radio station.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.680]   And so what would happen is that you would--
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.120]   you grab something out of the hot rotation,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.240]   which might show up three times in a given hour,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.560]   three different songs from the hot rotation.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.080]   You had a recurant that would show up--
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.920]   seasonal recurant that would show up once--
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.080]   --a little d-week current.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.000]   You'd have a goldy, which was a gold rotation, which
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.480]   was like your old Depeche Mode and the police and the cure
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.320]   and things that you were sure people would want to hear,
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.520]   even though it was old.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.000]   And then you'd have all these current ones.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   And so the idea, though, is that you're
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.760]   able to constantly redesign how these work.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.280]   And it just goes-- as it's going down this smart playlist,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.680]   whatever this-- this Uber playlist, what it does
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.320]   is it's grabbing one from this playlist,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.360]   and then it goes to-- and grabs another one from this place.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.320]   In whatever order those playlists were given,
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.440]   it, does that make sense?
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.520]   So you're not going to hear-- so you'll hear the police,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.120]   and you'll hear the cure within a two-hour period,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.640]   but you won't hear Roxanne and then close to me
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.040]   right next to each other.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   It's going to mix it up.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.040]   It's going to mix it up.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.760]   Well, it keeps it mixed up, but it's mixed up.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.000]   But it's mixed up in the way I want it.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.160]   It's just Tuesday.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.680]   But it's mixed up in the way that I want it to be mixed up
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.320]   between new stuff.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.280]   Because the big thing is if you just do a random playlist,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.000]   you're getting this random splosh of all your music.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I can't hear your music.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.200]   This sounds like a very Apple, Apple scriptable.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.000]   This is any scriptable.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.240]   OK, well, John, I expect you to have it done by next week.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.760]   I'll enter it.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.000]   We should have a prize.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   What do you have?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.800]   You have-- you have-- very clear about your needs.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.280]   Here's the deal.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.960]   And I want to find out what you're going to give the kids.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.400]   You can't win one of our microphones.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.320]   We need all sorts of things.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:24.760]   No, no, no.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   Here's the deal.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.800]   If someone actually gets what I'm--
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.200]   I'm willing to go back and forth.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.080]   You write the spec.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.680]   You do your little frickin' movie.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.240]   And then I want you to give them something cool for all
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.600]   this trouble and making them listen to this.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   OK, here's the deal.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:35.920]   Here's the deal.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.360]   I'll give them a DV Garage Powerpack.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.200]   Ooh.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   Powerpack.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.080]   Powerpack.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.760]   Powerpack.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.720]   Here's the DV Garage Powerpack.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   Sunday.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.200]   Sunday, Sunday.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.440]   No overpass.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   So anyway, the DV Garage Powerpack is pretty much everything
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.160]   the DV Garage makes.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.040]   It's worth about $1,100.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.560]   What?
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:53.800]   Do software.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   So it's all part--
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.040]   Is it retail value?
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   Yes, the retail value.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   It's--
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.680]   But it can be yours for the price of one Apple script
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.600]   that will do this correctly.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.640]   And it's contained in an actual garage.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.720]   So the first person who can get that done.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.320]   And now I know--
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   What's included in that?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.040]   It's a ton of Photoshop training that DV Garage makes.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.000]   My Photoshop training.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.360]   And it's got a bunch of texture maps for 3D artists.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.600]   It's got stuff on how to use QuickTime Pro, how to use
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.240]   all kinds of visual effects tools, how to do green screen
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.520]   and blue screen, how to do 3D.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.440]   So it's a bunch of-- a lot of tutorials, some tools.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.000]   It's got DV Mat, which does a really--
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.600]   I bet you might.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   --game.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   I mentioned that thing that I did for how to learn After Effects
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.880]   is still in that.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.480]   It probably is.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.720]   So there's a ton of stuff in it.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.320]   And--
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:33.840]   That's pretty good.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.920]   We'll give that away.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   So that's one of the ones--
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.520]   I'll throw in Hipster PDA.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.960]   Sign by all of those.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.800]   There you go.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.360]   So do you have any--
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.600]   What are you going to give?
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.200]   I have a quarter.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:43.720]   OK.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.280]   And John-- is it like a hobo quarter?
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.520]   Is it one that you fashioned it?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.360]   No, no, no.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.200]   The reason is the reason is the quarter is symbolic.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.440]   Because if--
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.760]   You're giving them a symbol?
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.720]   No, no.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   The thing is is that if you ask for an idea and somebody
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.200]   responds to it, you pay them.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.360]   You pay them the quarter.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:01.860]   Ah.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.360]   It's like here.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.240]   That's really the proper way to do it.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.960]   What kind of disappointing thing a father would tell you?
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.600]   No, no.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:06.960]   This is--
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.880]   I'm going to send them a drawing--
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.720]   I'm just going to send them a drawing.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.400]   I was just going to do it.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.920]   I'm talking about this on the other podcast.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.600]   But the idea was is that--
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.200]   In a couple of different effects firms
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.000]   that we worked in that what we would do is
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.760]   anytime someone told you a tip that was really useful for you,
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.800]   you'd always give them a quarter.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.120]   That was kind of your way of saying thanks.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.400]   It was kind of a hip wave.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.720]   Yeah, I had a similar thing in college.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.920]   If you mentioned Mindy Python, you
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.880]   had to put a quarter in the kitty.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.680]   Similar kind of thing.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.520]   Similar to that.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.880]   The idea was that whenever I had-- somebody
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.600]   said an idea.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.760]   It's like, oh, here's this great idea.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.080]   I'm like, well, thank you very much.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.480]   And I would pay them a quarter.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   And then later on, if I actually developed the idea and used it,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.000]   they couldn't complain that I didn't--
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.680]   Oh, it's a weasel out thing.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   It's a weasel out thing.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.600]   We used to--
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.640]   We started off giving people beer.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.480]   But then they stopped giving us any good tips
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.680]   by 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.760]   Because they had alcohol poisoning.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.960]   Well, yeah, they know.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.560]   You get lots of good tips from not really--
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.520]   The really good ones.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.560]   The really good ones would get liver damaging after it.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.720]   So all you've been throwing a beer.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.440]   All right.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.640]   So we've got-- what's it?
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.440]   $14,000.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.000]   What was it?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.120]   How much is it?
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.360]   John will buy you a beer if you come to San Francisco.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.600]   We're not sending beer over the--
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.760]   I'm just saying make it interesting.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.840]   So we've got a package here.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.640]   We could digitize it, put it on the FTP site,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.640]   and they could download this.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   And letable beer.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.240]   It's not like an e-beer.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.360]   OK, well, I think this is good.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.040]   That's a start.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.760]   All right.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   Matt guys, is he in or is he out?
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.320]   He's in.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.080]   He's so in.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.280]   OK, according to Apple Insider, he's out.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.040]   Now, according to his blog, he's in.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.840]   He's in.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.240]   OK, now again, I got to be professor context here.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.600]   People don't know what you're talking about.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.920]   We're talking about the hilarious.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.160]   I'm a Mac.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.000]   I'm a PC.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.480]   I'm a PC.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.720]   So I'm a Mac.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.360]   John Hodgman in person nature.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.320]   So I'm a Mac, was supposedly out.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.960]   He was reported as being done, and that John Hodgman PC
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.800]   was going to be the--
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.000]   And people were coming out of the woodwork
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.960]   to pile on this guy.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.400]   They're like, they're like, this guy.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.280]   I'm like, wait a minute.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.760]   I think he's great.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.520]   I think he's funny.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   I think it works really well.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.200]   People, did you get that?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.480]   The people were like, oh, I've never
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   liked him a long.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.360]   I don't like the make a blade.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.800]   He has a hoodie, and he's a hipster.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.880]   I think the technical term was snarky.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.680]   Yeah, snarky.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.200]   Snarky.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.960]   I didn't get that all.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.640]   But anyway, so the story was--
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.080]   and according to his web blog or blog--
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.840]   He's like, as for the Mac commercials,
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.240]   I don't know where that report came from that said,
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.720]   I wasn't going to do anymore.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.880]   I literally setting my alarm right now
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.600]   to wake up for a Mac shoot tomorrow.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   I'm not doing anymore, I guess.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.000]   I can sleep in and take the day off.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   There you go.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.400]   So I guess he's still in.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.720]   Now, do you think anybody's complaints are they all ground?
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.680]   Well, you know, I'm an unapologetic John
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.000]   Hodgman fanboy.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.840]   If you have not read his book, The Areas of My Expertise,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.360]   you should read it.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.480]   And you should get the books on CD
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.600]   because it is the funniest thing
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.360]   that you'll hear this year.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.320]   I am a huge John Hodgman fan, so I think the problem is--
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.920]   Download the Hobo's.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   All the names.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.960]   The 700 Hobo names is available on his site as 1 and B3.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.680]   With Jonathan Colton singing--
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   In one take.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.320]   In one take, he played guitar for 50 minutes.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.320]   So anyway, I am an unapologetic fanboy of Mr. Hodgman.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.200]   And so I think part of the problem
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.480]   is he's so freaking funny in that commercial.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.760]   The one with the-- just let me--
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.280]   Just let me depreciate you.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.480]   He's a very, very gifted comic.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.040]   And that's a lot of competition to live up to.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   And also, I mean, anybody will tell you
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.120]   the harder job in a comedy relationship is usually
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:32.840]   the straight man.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.640]   And the straight man usually gets paid more
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.160]   because it's not the--
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.400]   Yeah, and I think that it was one of those things.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.560]   As soon as this came up, I started thinking about it.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.280]   And I said, why is a little snarky?
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.080]   Well, who would you--
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.560]   OK, so if you wanted--
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.320]   But whose thing is it is what I realized was
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.560]   is that there was a bunch of us that are Mac guys going,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.160]   yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.440]   And as if you think about it from the other side,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.000]   then you maybe feel like it's a little condescending.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.800]   I spent a little bit of time thinking about this.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.360]   And I came up with the--
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.600]   came to the conclusion that PC was going to upgrade himself
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.720]   to a Mac.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.120]   He was going to take the essence of himself
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.000]   and become a switcher.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.520]   He was going to-- the PC was going to switch.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.520]   PC was going to switch.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.040]   And that PC--
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.880]   And would start wearing a hoodie?
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.280]   Yeah, well, he would just be different.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.640]   He would be-- he would say, you know what?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.960]   I used to do this and this, and I'm
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.360]   finding that I can still do those things.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.440]   But now I can make a book, and now I can be make a movie,
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.800]   and I can be creative, and I can do a podcast.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.680]   I can take myself wherever I want to go,
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.880]   because I'm an iBook now.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.560]   Maybe that'll be the end of the ad.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.440]   Interesting route.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.240]   Well, I just-- I would like to say, just for myself,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.120]   that I don't find him annoying.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.960]   So just to finish that thread, though, who--
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   if you take it--
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.560]   as most people do that, it's an entertaining commercial,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.240]   and people enjoy it.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.120]   Personally, I'm not sure if it's the most persuasive
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.280]   commercial to a PC user.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.680]   But I do think they're very funny and very well done.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.320]   Who should be, or what, should be portraying a Mac?
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.080]   [CLICKING]
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.280]   A girl from The Girl From Lost.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.200]   Oh, of Angeline Lilly?
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   She should be a Mac.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.440]   She'd be a Mac.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.000]   She'd be a Mac.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.520]   But I think that Jack would be a Mac.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   Jack would be a Mac.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.120]   I think Jack would be a Mac.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.640]   Actually, we should--
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.200]   Think Jack would be a Mac?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.720]   Do you think--
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.080]   I think Sawyer would be a Mac.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.000]   No, I don't know.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.320]   I think Sawyer would be Linux.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.360]   Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.440]   I think Sawyer would be Linux.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:11.960]   Freckles.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.080]   With the witch version.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.580]   Huh?
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.480]   Command Line or Gooey?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.360]   Oh, I think he would be Bash.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.040]   No, no, no.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.640]   I actually think Sawyer would be PC.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.000]   But I think he'd be like Windows 2000 or something like that.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.360]   Windows 2000 was the best release that there ever was.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:24.880]   What about--
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.520]   Sneak up on you.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.200]   You sneak up on you.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.680]   You sneak up on you.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.440]   Just when you think everything's fine.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.520]   What's his name?
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.080]   The creepy guy with the eyes.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.920]   The guy with the spine tumor.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360]   Oh, he's definitely PC.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.240]   He thinks he's definitely PC.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.360]   I think all the others are PC.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.560]   Yeah, but he's DOS.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.360]   Yeah, I don't think that-- except for The Girl,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.720]   the woman that Jack--
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.080]   Yeah, the piece of Mac.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   But she's definitely a Mac.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.800]   But the other guys are all PC.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.640]   Yeah, no.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.040]   Well, Kirk was a Mac, and Spock was definitely a Unix machine.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.400]   Mr. Echo, that's the one I'm not sure about.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.760]   Mr. Echo, just beat the crap out of you with whatever you're using.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.000]   I can't believe it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.360]   I cannot spoil it a lot.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.880]   I'm not going to say anything because people may not have seen it.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.920]   But I love Mr. Echo.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.960]   Well, obviously, I'm like going to use out of the conversation
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.400]   because you guys are using all these words
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.600]   that I'm talking about other characters and you're ignoring it.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.440]   I'm not ignoring the--
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.600]   Do you remember the essay?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.760]   Do you remember the essay?
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.240]   Did you say it?
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   Yes.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   I'm on drugs.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   Sorry, man.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.480]   Did you hear something, Alex?
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.000]   I don't hear anything here.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.480]   He's a character of monster.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   There was an article.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   There was an article.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.920]   Who do you think Mr. Echo is?
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.800]   I don't know.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   That's why we weren't listening.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.720]   Did you watch Oz on HBO?
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   You know what?
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.400]   I'm the guy who doesn't have a TV.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.320]   I don't own a TV.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.160]   I don't have a TV.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.240]   I've fashioned quill pens and Nick my own flooring.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.200]   But you just might--
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.520]   I make my own mud royal out of bananas.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.400]   I'm far and fear of consuming products, Nick, Ew.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.520]   So no, but you have played Mac Heist.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.520]   Yeah, I played Mac Heist.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   I'm not-- I'm not done with this here.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   I was segueing.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   You're segueing?
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   I'm sorry, I'm not in the lost--
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   So he missed over.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   I'm doing a segue.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   Because I don't have a TV.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520]   Lost is dead to my--
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   --my weekend playing Mac Heist.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   And what did you think?
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   Kind of cool.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   And in terms of context, what is Mac Heist?
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:10.320]   Well, the idea of Mac Heist is this new game thing that came out of--
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.520]   that's the next version of--
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   My Dream App.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   My Dream App.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.520]   And so the idea is get people to be involved.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   What is my Dream App?
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   My Dream App.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   My Dream App--
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   My Dream App is--
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.840]   My Dream App was a contest where a bunch of people wrote in with the ideas for the application
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.960]   that they would most want to see.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.240]   And Merlin and Leo and a bunch of other people judged this.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.480]   They came up-- it was a fierce competition over about two months, was it?
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.840]   And somebody came up with the winner, which was the recipe thing?
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.960]   Which was not the one where you get to pick out your clothes with your computer, unfortunately.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   That was kind of silly.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   You know what?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   I'm not going to get into this.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   Okay.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   But there were some great ideas.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.160]   And the whole idea of it, though, was that people come in and just-- you don't need to
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   be a developer.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   You just come in with a good idea.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.560]   And then the best or the most popular ideas would be made in actual apps.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.240]   Killed and turned into PC apps.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   Well, the funny thing about--
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   The funny thing about--
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   --have DRM added to them.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   The funny thing was--
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.440]   You know, as a long-time developer, I was looking at this.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.200]   I'm like, basically going, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   That's interesting.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   Ooh.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   You know?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.000]   Because it was like, well, we've seen a lot of these things already.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.600]   Because it would-- because you don't feel like there's a user interest or because it
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   wouldn't be fun to build.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.840]   Because it wouldn't be fun to build.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   And--
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.000]   This is like letting the guys with the brooms decide who gets to be in the parade.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   You know?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Yeah, let the developers decide what to do.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.360]   Well, no, because the idea of the closed thing was, okay, kind of interesting.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.560]   But it's a build nightmare.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.040]   It sounds like a delicious library for clothes.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.040]   But I'm going on a rattle here.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.400]   But you'd have to keep the barcodes on all the clothes for that to work.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.240]   You'd have to walk around like a total geek with barcodes on your clothes.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.480]   And everyone would know that you were running the fashion app.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   Yeah, that's your point.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.200]   Okay, so my dream app-- it's all closed up now.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   That's all done, right?
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   Yeah, it's done.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.080]   And so they moved on to Mac Heist.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.200]   So this is an interactive thing.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   Very first thing that you-- after you get an invitation, you get an assignment.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.520]   And pretty clear direction as to what is to happen.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.840]   And it's like a treasure hunt.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   It's a treasure hunt.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.280]   So I emailed the guy, Billy, whatever his name was.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.040]   And about an hour and a half later, I got an email back saying, prove to me who you are.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.160]   And I'm like, I'm on this week in media.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.680]   I really am not from Apple.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.040]   And he's like, oh, I guess you are.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040]   And I got my next assignment, right?
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   Was that-- I'm curious.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.040]   Was that accepted as a credential?
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.840]   It was-- no, they wanted-- you had to prove that you were basically digging up the iPhone
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.080]   specs as part of the heist.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   All right.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   Oh, I see.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.720]   So in order to do that, I had to give up that I was not with Apple and that I was the real
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.680]   deal and that Apple PR should talk to me.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.600]   And I got through that bot and then found the next bit.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.840]   Were you able to dig anything up?
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   I did.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   I found it.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   I solved the case.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   You won?
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:18.280]   Well, I got my heist code and I was able to get my loot.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   Wow.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.280]   It was fun.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   And you know what?
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   It didn't take that long.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.840]   You have like way more time than I do.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   I didn't spend that long.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   I spent maybe an hour.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   That's pretty cool.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.000]   That's more time than I have.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.480]   And so the first challenge was to get specs on the iPhone.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.040]   Has there been a second one yet?
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.680]   No, they haven't released the second one.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.400]   As near as I know, I haven't gotten an email saying, hey, next one's up.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   Fascinating.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   Fascinating.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.120]   Maybe it'll be your playlist.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   Maybe it'll be a free book.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   A lot of the year.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   It's a playlist map.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.280]   It's funny how this show is basically turned into the last two episodes.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.080]   It's basically to make it easier for Alex to exercise.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.040]   I think my wife would be very happy with that.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   My exercise.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   Exactly.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.640]   So speaking of pimping my exercise bike, have you seen this?
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.280]   A sneak preview of podcast producer?
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   This is on the Apple site.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.440]   And this is on the server for...
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.360]   It is...
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.520]   This is on Apple servers.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.320]   The podcast producer would sit on an Apple X-serve.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.400]   You can simply link into it.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   I don't...
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.280]   From the description that they have, I'm kind of slowly figuring out what they mean.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.600]   You can basically just say start up and go and it'll capture, compress, prepare.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.080]   So you've shot some video of yourself?
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   No, it lets you do it live.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.000]   This is an extension of QuickTime Broadcaster.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.360]   It's basically doing...
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.240]   You could still do a live show and then have it...
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.760]   I don't know if you could do a live show.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   Well...
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   I don't know if it will let you anyway.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.400]   It seems to me that they took QuickTime Broadcaster technology and they wrapped it into something
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.640]   that's potentially more useful than just QuickTime stream.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.600]   QuickTime Broadcaster, for those of you who don't know, is the app that allows you to shoot
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.400]   your own video and then spit it out at the compression and size of it?
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.400]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.960]   I've used that a couple of times.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.920]   And the biggest issue with QuickTime Broadcaster is finding an ISP that supports streaming Apple
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.760]   or QuickTime streaming video.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.080]   And there's only a few that don't.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   Here's what's interesting about this.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.360]   It says, "You can simply log in to podcast producer from any computer with an internet
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.520]   connection, select your camera, and click start.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.040]   When finished recording, click stop.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   That's it.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   Podcast producer takes care of the rest."
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.800]   So it pulls all that data.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   Wow.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   So it's not designed for us.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.040]   So it could be for a small group working together.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.960]   I think it's really designed for schools, companies who want to just have a bam, bam,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.560]   bam, bam, they're going to produce podcasts.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.160]   Because this is something that's really becoming a big deal.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.360]   We've been contacted by quite a few companies now that want us to produce podcasts for them,
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.600]   where they don't know anything about audio, but they do know that this is an effective
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.920]   communication tool to get to their 2,000 employees around the United States where they
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.160]   can just do a podcast.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.040]   Everyone downloads it on their iPod, listens to it on the way to work, and they can continue
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.880]   the propaganda properly.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.160]   This works really well in a classroom as well, because you'd have the Mac in front, you'd
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.680]   clip on your microphone, you'd make sure you had levels, and then off you go.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   And then at the end of it, then the pod--
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   That's really interesting.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Can you have a director?
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.080]   Can you have-- that is to say, can there be someone who kind of decides to pick streams
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   and stuff like that to decide--
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   Well, I don't think it's that complex yet.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.000]   Well, I only mention it because this also-- this would go straight into this kind of
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.200]   social media sort of stuff we've been talking about.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.000]   Yeah, I think the idea is that if you had the output of the camera that's going to this
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.280]   app and you were feeding in multiple-- a live switcher, for example, and that was your
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.240]   firewire feed, then you could get that.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   Yeah, you could do that.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.720]   It's one of those things that-- I think it's the first step.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.880]   I mean, I think that this is-- but I don't think the idea is to-- for podcasters who are
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.040]   serious about this, I don't think they're going to be using it, but I do think it's for
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.280]   educators, companies, and so on and so forth who don't want to know anything about it,
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.520]   they just want to turn it on, do it.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.120]   They're not worried about it being a perfect quality or they're not trying to compete with
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   TV.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.920]   They just want to get the message out to the employees.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.560]   They just packages all of that out for them, so it's pretty cool.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   It could be nifty.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   It's really interesting.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.640]   Have you played anymore with the big brother of VideoQ Pro, whose name is escaping me?
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.320]   What's the app that you were using?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.600]   We just finally got the cards.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.240]   So the guy sent me Wiretap Pro.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   Yeah, tell him about this.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.240]   It's kind of cool.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   So Wiretap Pro, VideoQ, right?
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.080]   I'm using VideoQ to shoot-- actually, the phone guy, whatever you call it, VideoCaster,
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.560]   whatever, I've been using VideoQ for.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   Right, and so this is-- this is--
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.280]   This is-- Q is like a teleponk program that uses your eyesight camera.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   Right, and they have an upper end.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.800]   They have a higher end one that is called Wiretap Pro.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:39.400]   And it's verasoftware.com, V-A-R-A software.com.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.280]   And they have this thing called Wirecast, and they sent me one to test.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.440]   And the problem was is that I wanted to test it on my quad, which only used PCIX.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.960]   And so then I had to order these firework cards.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.400]   I couldn't just go over to the Apple Store or over to CompUSA.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.920]   And it took forever to find them.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   And so I finally got them.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   They're sitting in this box over here.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.080]   So now I have to sit down and test it.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.280]   We're going to test it pretty soon because I want to show it for some of this new show
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.640]   that we're doing-- that we're going to start recording next week called Gear Media Tech
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.120]   GMT that we're going to do with Leo and Scott talking about podcasting, you know, and all
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   these different technologies.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.760]   You know, now what it does is it allows you to not only record, but you can fly in,
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.200]   look graphics, you know, lower thirds.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.280]   You can also do more than one camera.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   So as many--
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   That's exact.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.120]   The reason I was getting all these firework cards is so I can fire three cameras into
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.480]   it and be capturing-- well, it's not capturing all three cameras, but it's bringing them all
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   in.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.680]   I can do a live switch of those cameras.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   That's powerful.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.640]   So you can have people walking around.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.480]   Can you do like a wireless or would they all be--
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.800]   No, no, they all have to have a firework cable on them.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.160]   So you couldn't get crazy walking around.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.240]   But when you're watching Charlie Rose, let's say, you're looking at three cameras that
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.040]   are moving-- you know, that are floating around.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   Three cameras is also the classic kind of sitcom setup.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.000]   So but if you're doing an interview-- and when we were doing Twit videos, you know, we
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.120]   had three cameras, but the thing with Twit is that we would record them all, and then
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.040]   we'd have to go back and edit them later.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.640]   And then there was this long lag.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.440]   And there was this thing called broadcast storm or channel storm that would do it, but
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.720]   they would never give us enough power to record the full quality video to drive.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   And that's what these guys do.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.880]   And so the Wirecast Pro looks really, really good.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.840]   And when we do a little bit more testing probably in December, we'll know more.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   So it should be pretty interesting.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.320]   It's an exciting possibility for doing stuff, especially like if you look at Macbreak, Macbreak
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.200]   is three channels of information that are coming through.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.600]   You know, you have two cameras in the screen.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.720]   If we can figure out a way to just be switching back and forth between those.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.400]   And it also has a keyer built into it.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   Now it's not going to be a chroma key.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.280]   Yeah, chroma key that just built in.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   So if you're in front of a green screen.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   So you do green screen stuff.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   Yep.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   So it's pretty nifty.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   It's pretty pricey.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.120]   It's like 500 and some bucks.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   But it's a cool--
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.720]   But it's cheaper than a hardware switcher.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.440]   It is much cheaper than a hardware switcher.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.680]   The best hardware switcher, by the way, out there is about-- for a low price is the data
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   video one.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.840]   Data video makes one that's like $5,000.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840]   Wow.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.080]   That's about as little as it gets.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.480]   When you get a real hardware switcher, there's ones that are cheaper than that.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   But they're all crap.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   Well, you guys so--
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   We bought them all.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   And I'm pissed.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.160]   Well, Pixel Core's stock and trade is doing this very high-end stuff.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.240]   And you guys do great work at that.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.160]   Do you see interesting stuff happening in terms of the hardware and the software continuing?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.240]   It just seems like that's got to continue to develop and get interesting as more and
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.360]   more people as it becomes-- as ProSumer is going to become more something that like
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   everyday people want.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.360]   Well, we're seeing it happen.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.360]   Have you already seen it happen?
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.200]   The hardware, it's all going to come down to people's ability to develop good content
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   and be able to technically understand what they're doing.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.680]   But the tools are all going to be-- I mean, you can really do good audio podcasts for
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.880]   just for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.360]   You can do good video podcasts for probably 1,500 bucks if you already have a computer.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.800]   And really, if you have enough talent, you could do a good video podcast with a $300
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.760]   camera that you wander around with or even your eyesight.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.040]   I mean, you can practically do.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:03.560]   I mean, if-- so all that stuff is really becoming much more affordable and it's an exciting
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.560]   time.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.800]   It really is remarkable to think about-- I mean, I don't know enough about PCs to say, but
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.720]   it just feels like if you've got-- like in my case, a MacBook Pro?
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   Yeah, it's a MacBook Pro.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   That's a MacBook Pro.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   MacBook Pro.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   You got a MacBook Pro?
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   You go out.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.520]   I mean, like, I get a lot of people saying, you know, gosh, you know, well, how do you
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.120]   record your podcasts?
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.720]   And I mean, eventually I went out and bought a Radio Shack mic and a little pantyhose to
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   put over it.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.320]   But most of the time, I'm just using a USB, like a Skype headset.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   14.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   And--
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   14.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.760]   And I mean, it's not like I say, I mean, this is not super high-end, but you know, it's
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.560]   remarkable how kind of the ramp up to this stuff is not complicated.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.240]   And you can be doing some really high quality stuff.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.000]   And you know, I'm just saying, there's free tools that come with your Mac that you can
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.720]   do a lot of, like the quick time-- actually, Derek's story, we should link to this.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   Derek's story had a great tutorial from a while back, I think, actually, on how to use
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   the quick time broadcaster to capture to locally.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.800]   And that's-- so, I mean, there's all these kind of free tools out there that make this
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   so easy to do.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   And I think you're right.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.280]   I was thinking the biggest thing is the good content.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.800]   But your Mac sure makes it easy for you, said the fanboy.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.120]   I want to thank a couple people because I forgot who while we were doing it.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:18.600]   Mac-a-Mac, whoever Mac-a-Mac is, and also, Leo, Leo posted the Apple Podcast thing, and
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.680]   then CB did as well.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:26.200]   And these are egos to the Mac Heist.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.400]   And all of these guys, the only reason I'm saying this, I'm grabbing some of these names
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   out here because we've had a great number of people posting to our delicious list.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   Yes.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   And I want to make sure people keep on doing that.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   I love this.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:44.280]   It is so awesome, and the software that my software pick for the week here was I had
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.440]   no idea existed until I looked the list.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   And I'm in heaven.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   And I'll talk about it.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.040]   So should we remind people how to do this?
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.160]   What you want to do is if you're listening to this and you want us to do something, you
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.960]   want to put it on our list of things that we might talk about.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.720]   You found something fun for us to talk about.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.760]   What you want to do is you want to go to Delicious, and that-- just do a Google for Delicious.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.520]   I'm not going to try to explain it on the web.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.560]   Just start typing the word delicious, and then add some random periods.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   It's the goofiest thing.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   So anyway--
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   Oh, is she--
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.560]   So delicious, and create your own delicious list.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.160]   And what a delicious list is, is you can have this little JavaScript that you kind of
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.920]   drag into your bookmarks.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.280]   And when you're on a site, you can just say, oh, I want to remember that.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.760]   I want to remember where that is.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.160]   And I just click on it, and it makes these delicious lists.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   And you can give it tags.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.080]   And the tags are really what make it powerful.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.040]   But one of the things you can do is you can tag it.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.520]   M-B-W ideas, just put that in the tag.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   One word.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   You can put a bunch of other tags, but just put that all in one word.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.440]   M-B-W ideas.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.360]   We see the list, because I can go in and search delicious slash tag slash M-B-W ideas.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.840]   And anybody can do this.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.800]   Anybody can search and see the list of the things that we're looking at.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.360]   And literally most of the stories that we're talking about this week were generated by
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.840]   the listeners, which I think is awesome.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   Yeah, totally.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.280]   You know, it was just like we're allowing you to really, you know, let us know what you
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.840]   think is important.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.200]   And we have some ideas of things that we want to talk about.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.420]   But I think that it's really powerful and it was really useful and I hope more people
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   do it.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.700]   Yes, I agree completely.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.320]   What are the app choices?
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   Oh, is it time?
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   It's time.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.400]   We should have music for this part of the show.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.880]   Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.360]   Who does first-done?
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   John.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.760]   I'm going to talk about a program called Right Room.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.960]   And this is labeled "distraction-free writing."
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:36.920]   Now, the cool thing about writing on a computer is that you can basically make copy perfect
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:42.000]   copy or, yeah, that's right.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:49.600]   But the problem that I have is that my email, my webpage, my everything, my IM is all in
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.800]   front of me and it's distracting me from my writing, most annoying.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:59.480]   So Right Room takes over the screen and gives you something that looks like 20 years ago
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.520]   with my Apple II and the green screen.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.680]   And all the command keys still work.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:11.040]   So bold, command I, command B, command U for underlying all that stuff still work.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.760]   So I get this green text or it could be any color text, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.360]   And then so I'm just typing away.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.360]   It's like a typewriter.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.560]   And then once that's done, command S gets me my saved stuff and I'm back to what I'm
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   doing.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.560]   What's that called?
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   It's full screen mode.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   Internet, no RSS.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   No RSS, nothing.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.560]   No tables.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   No phone, no motor car.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   Not in the scene.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.960]   I literally, there are places that I go hide just so I don't have an internet connection.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960]   So I can actually think.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.000]   Well, first of all, this is, this app is part of a really interesting development.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.600]   I think there's a lot of partisanship on the whole idea of full screen apps and the
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.920]   idea of distraction free apps.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.560]   It's something that I personally, at 43 folders, have gotten really adamant about.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.240]   If you're like me and any shiny piece of tin foil takes you off what you're doing for
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.480]   an hour, you really want to be minimizing those kinds of distractions.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.800]   This is a terrific app.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:08.920]   You're seeing this more and more now in like pay apps, things like Devin Think and I think
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.160]   it's Devin Think we'll do that.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.560]   And we'll see the other one.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.560]   But this is terrific.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.680]   It's like being in a shell.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.320]   It's really cool to write in.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.080]   And the thing that I, I mean, I do a lot of writing.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:26.600]   I do writing in text edit, I do writing in those stupid forms on the web page and I'm
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.440]   getting out of the habit of doing that and just, you know, taking writing out of the,
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   out of the web.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:38.640]   Do you use the, do you use that text mate service for opening text areas and text mate?
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.640]   No, I didn't know about it.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.440]   Okay, this is just if you're, I like text mate a lot.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.080]   Well, if you use it, for you, those of you who are using text mate, this is worth knowing.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.040]   I think this installs automatically.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.360]   I'm trying to remember if not, I apologize and I'll try to find out.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:56.000]   But basically if you're in any text area in Safari, you can select all and hit apple,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.480]   enter.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.600]   And basically that'll create, I guess like a temp file and it'll open that up inside
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.920]   of text, text mate.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.280]   You have, you know, expose all the text mate functionality.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.840]   You could be doing a markdown, HTML, what have you.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.720]   And then when you're done, you save and you close and it goes back and it's all pop.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.320]   It's kind of a, something Firefox has done for a long time.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.560]   But it's, it's so much better than typing in a text area.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.000]   So I'm with you though.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   That's a great app.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.520]   There's other apps that are like, and the reason I got this was that I was a participant,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:29.200]   and a participant in Nano Raimo, which is the National Writing Month.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.440]   And the idea is to write 50,000 words in a month, you know, write a book in a month.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.760]   And it's this, it's a total mental catastrophe.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.720]   How are you in Safari?
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.320]   I'm at 15,000 words.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.960]   So I'm kind of on, I'm a little bit behind.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.880]   But, you know, I'm on track for, for being close.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.880]   Nice.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   That's craziness.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   Yeah, it is crazy.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.760]   But you know, like Corey Doctorow is talking about in a, in a writing thing, you really
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.920]   have to make writing a, a non-event.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.880]   You have to be able to just say, oh, I'm going to write now.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.840]   And you know, whenever that is, you just, it really is.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   It's a great, it's a great exercise in doing this.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.880]   There's, there's something creatively about getting past the, I have to be in the right
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.280]   mode or I have to be in the right mode.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.520]   Or I've got this elaborate ritual I have to go through in order to start writing.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.160]   The more you can like lower the, the, the pitch of that ramp.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   So that you can just start, if you've got five minutes, that's what Corey's great at.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.240]   Corey, if you ever watch Corey work, he gets these little pockets of five minutes and he
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.320]   just, he'll just start writing or doing whatever.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.520]   And so it really is training yourself to do that.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.760]   And I think that with the computer, especially with the Mac where you can switch modes really,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.240]   really quickly and you know, you're not, your screen isn't taking over that.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:46.640]   I think if you can learn to disassociate the event, the, the, the, actually not the event,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.880]   but the ritual, I just need to do this.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.880]   And then there it is.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.360]   It's, it's kind of fun.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.880]   I mean, I don't have a phone and I talk to people using email, using the form, using
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.880]   IM and all that.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.480]   And you know, everyone's like, how do you do that?
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.760]   I'm like, I just do it.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.520]   That's the way I, that's the way I communicate.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.520]   Right.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   Just one other quick suggestion.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.720]   This is something I picked this up from Danny O'Brien a long time ago, but another great
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   trick.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.720]   And I think it's a really, really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:56.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:59.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:34.720]   And I think it's a really interesting thing to do.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   Which is 206-666-5338.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.720]   And it's a real fake phone number.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:47.720]   So what happens is it goes right to voicemail.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.720]   And it says, "Leave me a message."
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   And after you leave me a message, it's packaged up as a wave and sent to my email.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   As you say, it goes to DevNo.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   So you're going to get like 80 emails tomorrow.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   And you're going to get a Macbreak weekly.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   And you guys are really cool.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Nice podcast, dumbass.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.720]   Oh yeah, this is so tech support hell just happened.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   But anyway, I think it's really cool because what happens is that if I'm in front of my computer and I get that message, then I can probably help you.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.720]   But if I'm not, that means I'm somewhere else.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   It's also one of the million great reasons to get VoIP.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   I was paying a really exorbitant amount each month to those jackals at Pacific Bell or SBC or whatever they're called this week.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   And you're now in AT&T?
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   AT&T now, that's right.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   And the ballpark, they're just going to get an LED sign that they can change.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   Okay, for those of you not in San Francisco.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   We used to have a really normal name for our ballpark.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   It used to be called Pacbel, which is perfect.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   Pacific Bell Park.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   But it just says Pacbel Park.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   It came off, it rolled off your road off your truck.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   Pacbel Park.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.720]   You're going down to Pacbel Park.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   It was great.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   And then they changed it.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   Then they changed it to SBC.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   And SBC actually stood for South Beach Community Park.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   So the San Francisco people will actually get that because that area is called South Beach.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   I didn't know that.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720]   No, you know.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   When they called it SBC, it made a lot of sense.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   Because like, oh my god, this is kind of a local play.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   At least, at least, you know what, we're done with this.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   It says, "BC Park," they changed the names on all the cups.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.720]   They changed the names on all the hats.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   And then it became AT&T.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   So now it's Death Star Park.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   Oh my god.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720]   Because it looks like a food, they're a little bit of a death star.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.720]   It's Death Star Park named after...
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:32.440]   It did me much goodness and joy in my life to tell them to take their $100 a month that
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:38.720]   I was spending between connectivity and phone and show it up there.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   Corporate area.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.720]   And I got this thing called Sun Rocket.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   Sun Rocket is not perfect.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   It works on your IP.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   So like a lot of these, it'll just drop out sometimes.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.720]   But the functionality is insane.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   You can create all these numbers.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.720]   It's $200 a year to run this.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   I just use it to forward to my cell phone.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   I have this phony, baloney business number I use that basically it's nothing but voicemail
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   and does the same thing.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   I get a wave file.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   When somebody leaves a voicemail message, I get a wave file.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   I get a message to my cell phone and I get an email.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   And I can listen to it right in the email.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   Like to me, I've said all along, I want spam assessment for my phone.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   Like I want regular expressions for my phone.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   It just seems crazy to me that this has gotten so much better.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   Now, oh, and you can also block numbers.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   Any incoming number can be blocked.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.720]   So if you're getting like those weird election year things.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720]   Anyway, I can't say enough good things about that.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720]   So I'm with you on that.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Is that your app?
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   Is that your app?
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   It could be my app and I had another.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   The other thing is kind of cool about living in the 4.5 and having a choice.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   That was Alex's signal.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   That was the segue.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   That was the segue.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   We've been talking about this too long as we're going.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720]   You should get a big segue stick.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.720]   We're not going to talk anymore about that.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   You know what?
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.720]   In future episodes, it's not very Macky.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   I think that's actually kind of an interesting idea of the way.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   This is my application.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   My application.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   I don't know how much this is going to be useful to other people.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   But as Leo surprised me by announcing a couple weeks ago,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   I'm working on putting together some kind of a program for Pixel Core and Twit.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It's going to be fun.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.720]   Well, we'll say about that.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   But in writing some of the stuff, believe it or not,
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   it's not all just going to be screen captures and index cards.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   I needed to do a little bit of writing.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   I came across this application that I like a lot.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Now, again, this is like a lot of these kinds of applications.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   You've got to be careful that if you are the easily distracted type,
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   this is the worst thing in the world for you.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   But if you need to write anything like a screenplay,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   check out, I think it's called CellTex, C-E-L-T-X.com.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   This is a free application that emulates a lot of the functionality
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   of higher end screenwriting apps.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   It is so frickin tricked out with awesome stuff.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.720]   You can go in and not only do you get all these little sub areas
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.720]   and tabs for doing things like you read a scene.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   And it all remembers the name of that scene.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.720]   Oh, and show me what props appear in that scene.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   And show me which people appear in that scene.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   And show me who the animal handler for that scene is.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.720]   And all this stuff gets captured in different files.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   You can spit out a shooting script.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.720]   You can spit out, I mean, Alex, this is something Alex has probably looked at in the past.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   But if you're looking for a way to whether you are just a writer,
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.720]   you're a producer, if you're looking to script some stuff,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   this could be fun for school projects probably.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   It's free as in beer.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.720]   Yeah, so I showed this to you.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.720]   I showed this to you.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.720]   I just didn't remember how much it was.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   There's a montage, there's another one that's very similar that's really cool.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   The costs.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   And there's a, you know, what's the one everybody uses?
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   Final draft.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   Final draft.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   And if memory serves, this uses, this is final,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   this plays friendly with final draft.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   It opens it up.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   It's got that look to it.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   That Firefox kind of slightly swingy kind of look.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.720]   But it's, I think it's a terrific app.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720]   And the fact that it's free just blows my mind.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   So if you need to do any kind of writing or any kind of even preparing for a production,
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   have a look at C-E-L-T-X dot com.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.720]   Is that it's my advice to you?
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.720]   Alex, do you have an app this way?
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   I have an app.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.720]   This one, this one was brought to me by one of our listeners.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   Oh, I love our listeners.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's this?
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.720]   S-P-M-R-F.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   Chunky lover 53.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.720]   So this one is called, I show you.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   Oh, when you go, I show you.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   I show you.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   Making friends across the world.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   I show you.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   So anyway, I show you.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   It just makes me want to say it that way.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.720]   I don't know why, because you're excited.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720]   You just go, oh, I show you.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   I show you.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   So I show you.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:45.720]   So anyway, so I show you is, now to give you background, in the Pixel core we use this program
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   called Snaps, very, very heavily by Enbrosher Software, where it captures, it does a screen capture.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   So you turn it on and you can capture video.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   And so you can capture all this video and you can click on it and everything else.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   Now here's the problem with Snaps, and I can say this because I've told them about, you know,
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   200,000 times.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   It's got an Intel update, like, not very long.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   Which still doesn't work for my laptop.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   So frustrating.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:13.720]   So anyway, it worked and then I upgraded for 10.4.8, which is, by the way,
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   every time you upgrade it, it loses your license and I'll just start getting the watermark again.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.720]   Yeah, so the, but the other thing is, is that I just have to say, not in the fence of Snaps,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   10.4.8 is the new 10.29.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   Remember 10.29?
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720]   It really is.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.720]   I declare 10.48 the new 10.29, which is--
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   The new 6.08.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   I think it happens.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   I think it usually happens at the end of a cycle and it's like Apple's subtle way of, we're going to really mess your computer up
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   so that you upgrade to Leopard.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.720]   You know, is it because it--
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   Really?
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   I have had so many problems with my apps.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   With all of my apps, since I upgraded 10.48, as I did when I upgraded to 10.29.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.720]   10.29 was the last, like, really hell upgrade.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.720]   You know where everything got messed up.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   I upgraded to 10.8.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   I couldn't even restart my computer.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   I had to give it back to Alutha and have him do whatever Alutha does.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.720]   He's like, "This is my computer's not starting up and you need to do whatever you do to make it."
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   He brought it back in about an hour and it was working, but I don't know what he did and it wasn't my problem.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   Oh, I know.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   He reinstalled the patent.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   I don't know.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   He did something.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   You got to probably run the combo up there.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.720]   He did.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.720]   That's usually the same.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   And wave the rubber chicken around.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   He did.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   I don't know.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   Alutha does all his hocus-pocus and all works.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   And that broke Snaps Pro X for you.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720]   And it still does work.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   What it'll do is it'll record and then it'll go into the saving process, but when I get done, there's nothing there.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720]   So you don't find out until...
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720]   And that's the thing is it holds it in...
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.720]   Hold on.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   Here's the other thing about Snaps.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.720]   Does it make a temp file or is it all in RAM?
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720]   No, it's making a temp file.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   So it does a .mo, .mo thing that it's recording to your desktop or whatever.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   Wherever you're going to save it, it saves one there.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   And then it reconverts it.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   So it's capturing it, this high resolution.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.720]   And then it reconverts that to a whatever movie that you choose.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   And here's the difference between this and I show you.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   Does the same capture.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720]   There's more control over how you capture.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   And when you hit stop, the movie's there.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.720]   Instant.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.720]   Oh man.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   And when you're on the set, like when we're doing Mac Break.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   We wait 20 minutes.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.720]   You had to add other computers.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   Well, that wasn't the only reason.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:29.720]   On Mac Break we did that because part of the reason that we do that is so that we can have people coming in and setting up while other people are on.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.720]   So there's two reasons for it.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.720]   Sure.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.720]   But one of the big reasons is so that we didn't have to wait for Snaps to capture.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:45.720]   Because the nice thing about using a screen capture program instead of like a DVI to SDI or whatever or a scan converter is that you get this crystal clear really high quality screen graph.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.720]   It's pixel for pixel.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720]   I mean it's just beautiful.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:55.720]   So anyway, and Snaps was the only one that would capture it 30 frames a second or 15 frames a second or whatever frame a second we wanted it would capture it.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.720]   This one I tested today.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   So I literally just saw it today while I was prepping for the show.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.720]   I downloaded it and tested like the demo which has this big green text on it on my laptop and it worked and I got so excited.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720]   I first I emailed him.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.720]   I emailed him and I said can I have an NFR?
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   An NFR is a not for resale.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   When you're a press person you do this all the time where you email and you request it.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   You know I'm from this and you have to give me your potentials and you say can I have an NFR and to test it.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.720]   And you feel bad because this application is like 20 bucks.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   But you still, you know it's the principal of the thing.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.720]   You know I'm not going to, you know.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   So anyway if it doesn't work then you're not going to pay him 20 bucks.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   Or that's the whole thing.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   Yeah I mean you mentioned on the show that's what they, that's the pay.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   You can't buy them all.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   Yeah you can't because I have to test so many things.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.720]   Maybe just 20 bucks but you can't buy everything.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.720]   I've talked to software companies later when I call them.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   Plus you love free stuff more than maybe anybody I've ever met.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.720]   I like testing stuff.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720]   It's not that I like free stuff.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   I just don't like paying for everything that I test.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720]   It's like a set of wheel of fortune in this place.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720]   I got the damnation.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   We got, it was so funny.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.720]   I walked out today and there was these huge boxes from BSW that were here because we're doing these decisions.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.720]   You know because we're doing these, this show on podcasting.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   And so I had like $10,000 worth of hardware.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720]   I have to give it back.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   I'm just borrowing it but it is a little like Christmas here today.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720]   So anyway so anyway so I sent out a request for NFR but I got so excited.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.720]   I wanted to make sure that I could talk about it or not talk about it on the show.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   I got so excited that I just bought it anyway.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   Oh my gosh.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.720]   Mark the calendar's kids.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.720]   I threw that hot software.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   I threw that $20 down and bam I had it.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.720]   So I got this guy out of New Zealand.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   It's just a program.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   It's like a shareware kind of thing.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720]   It's 20 bucks?
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   It's 20 bucks.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.720]   That's pretty screaming for, it fits capture and video.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   So option 4 thing, can you leave like a portion of the screen and the whole nine?
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.720]   You can do, you can do portion of prototype stuff.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   All the snaps, all the snaps, all the snaps stuff and more.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   And so, so the, and it has this nice little interface.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   It's not like you have to decide later.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   You decide all up ahead of time and you have all the stuff.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   So anyway, so I did the test.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   Now I haven't done what, now snaps what I know is that I can capture 30 minutes straight
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   and nothing will happen.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   And that's something I haven't tested yet.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   And so one of the things that I still haven't really gone through yet is, you know, how far can I take this?
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   So what the longest capture I've done so far is like a minute or two.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   And, and, but I captured 30 frames a second on a 1920 by 1200 monitor.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   Brilliant.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.720]   So this is my, you know, 24 inch, my 24 inch cinema display.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   Wow.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720]   And so I pulled it out 30 frames a second.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720]   I'm moving stuff around.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720]   I'm talking.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.720]   I'm talking.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   How long was it?
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.720]   It was only like a minute or 30 seconds.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   It was like 153 megs or something like that.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.720]   I mean, it's, it gets big quick, but it'll be, it'll be bigger than that.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.720]   No, it'll be gigabytes when I'm, you know, when it's, when it's done capturing.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.720]   But here's the thing is that if I had done that, it would have been at least a couple minutes
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   while I waited.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.720]   It would have been at least 30 seconds to a minute while I was saving, you know, on snaps.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.720]   And this one, I hit it and boom, there was the movie.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.720]   I mean, it was there.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720]   You know, unbelievable.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720]   I show you.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720]   I show you.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   All these links that we're mentioning are, are you just writing these down?
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   No.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   No.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.720]   No.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720]   We remember this.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720]   There, if you go to Delicious, they're all there.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   Everything.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.720]   Here's the thing.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.720]   We don't even have to do this show.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.720]   We need a secretary for this show.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.720]   Okay.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.720]   There's going to be a secretary for the show email list.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.720]   No, no.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   So the, the, but, but literally every link that we've talked about in this show is at Delicious,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.720]   you know, slash tag slash, and B.W.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.720]   Right.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.720]   Right.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   Right.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720]   Good idea.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720]   There you go.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   That's it.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.720]   We still don't have a good log off for this show.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   Mm.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   Okay.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.720]   I'm going to break the silence just because I'm so happy about it.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.720]   We didn't mention the Zoom in the entire episode.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   You ruined it.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   You ruined it.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   Oh, God.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:41.720]   I'm so tired of hearing of both sides of the Zoom and I just, I'm really glad that we made it.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720]   You ruined it.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720]   We had made it all the way through.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.720]   Banana.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.720]   Edit that out.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.720]   No.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.720]   See now we haven't, we haven't, we can't edit it out.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   So now I've ruined our cred.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.720]   You've ruined everything's all right.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   You just said that I didn't talk.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.720]   I think we're, I think we just re-record the whole show.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.720]   We'll start over.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.720]   Okay.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   Well, here we go.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   Starting over from the top.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.720]   Justin.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   These are great new mics Alex.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   We got these.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720]   These are high on mics.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   So we, we just got them.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720]   Listen, I'm going to pass the video camera.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.720]   Justin is a, Justin is still a Mac and he's not going to be on this.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   Not, not, not a Mac.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.680]   The, we really thought that, uh, I show you Alex, Alex, Alex Brooke, uh, bro, uh,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.680]   with, with his fellow fan thing.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   We, uh, we got new mics.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.680]   We, um, what else do we do?
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.680]   No fly list.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.680]   No fly list.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.680]   My kiss.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.680]   My kyce is okay.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   There's a podcast producer.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   There's, um, there's podcasts on the flights.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.680]   Um, X serve things pretty cool.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.680]   So that's about it.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.680]   Well, there we go.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   That's a shorter show than we started on the first one.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   So, uh, well, we re-recorded and we still didn't mention the zoom in, in a second.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   Oh!
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.680]   Oh, recursion.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.680]   All right.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680]   Okay.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.680]   So, um, this is Mac break and Mac break weekly and, um, we'll see you next week.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   There we go.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.680]   That's, that's still a lame ending.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   I missed Scott.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   We, we should, we should have said hi to Scott.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   That's not here.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Bring him in.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, we're Leo Scott.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.680]   None of our, we're not doing these.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   We're not even here.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   The mature ones were gone.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   The grownups, the grownups, the grownups are gone.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.680]   The grownups are gone and the kids are just playing with the mics.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.680]   The grownup who, uh, says that, yeah, I'm just happy with my TV, dude, my tang and my remote
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   control and that's all I need, not one more thing.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   They don't need one more thing.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   Mac, when I was your age, we didn't know what I was.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   Things were simpler and we were happy.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.680]   We made belts out of things that we found in the yard.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   We made 16 millimeter of steel.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   You wanted a wig, you had to make it yourself and that's how it was after the war.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   And we were happier then because...
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   We drew carrots in the yard.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680]   You had carrots.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   We didn't even have a yard to don't care.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.680]   It's in.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   We just ate, we just ate grass.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.680]   We borrowed paper to draw pictures of carrots and we'd eat the paper.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.680]   That was our fiber and we were happy.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.680]   Oh, you had paper.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.680]   We just had to eat the crayons.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   Luxury.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.680]   All right, put a quarter in the money python jar.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.680]   All right, I'm going to put a straight room thing.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.680]   Hogman software, they got a pretty sight.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.680]   Coyvin, I think, did...
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   Who does subtraction?
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.680]   Dude, I don't know if you did this design.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.680]   They had a Drupal site for a while.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   I hate Drupal.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.680]   Shut up, Drupal rules.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.680]   Whatever you can get your hand.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.680]   You can mostly just swear at it.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   Drupal, Drupal, the thing is...
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680]   It's good, I just want to...
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.680]   Drupal, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.680]   I'm not a web guy.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.680]   It was just to say that, well, if you're like me and you go back to PHP nuke,
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   you look at something like Drupal and how each version gets so much better.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   And you just look at that, the other stuff just seems like a such a rass.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   But PHP nuke was really a horrible thing.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   Was that the beginning?
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.680]   Was that where things forked?
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   There's post nuke was there.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   Yeah, post nuke and follow-up.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680]   But both of them were bad.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   I mean, if you ran that on your server, your server was just like...
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.680]   Because of SQL, my shipping hits.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.680]   Yeah, no, it was just really inefficient.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.680]   Badly coded.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.680]   Badly coded, man.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.680]   Whoa, for its time.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   I looked at HTML code one time and I decided I was never going to learn how to do this.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.680]   And I never have.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.680]   Huh, for real?
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.680]   I did.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.680]   I was like, I like, someday this is, we're going to look back at this post script.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.680]   You know, you don't need to write this stuff.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.680]   I'm not going to learn it.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.680]   I just didn't.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.680]   Well, that's why iWeb is kind of a cool thing.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   I mean, you can do a lot without ever having to touch.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   I don't even do that.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   I'm just waiting.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]   I'm waiting for the next level.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.680]   I'm waiting for when I just design stuff like a...
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.680]   It's kind of like iWeb, but one that actually runs fast.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.680]   How would you describe a write room?
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   I'm saying, John Foster's web pick for this week.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680]   Full screen.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   Writing app.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   Out of your way, editor.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   It gets other stuff out of your way, editor.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   Okay.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   Cool.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   All right, so is that a pretty easy one to edit, you think?
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   I'm not editing anything.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   I'm just going to ask that to the front of the back.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.680]   Out of your way.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.340]   (upbeat music)
