[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   Thanks you to the New York Times Virginia heffernan for giving us that phrase many moons ago. Yes, we're proudly obsessive
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.720]   That's why Eddie Inaco is here. He obsesses on squirrels comic books and the Boston Public Library
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.800]   I don't obsess I merely pay respected elements of American society there do and also
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   We're not all about everything that you need all about everything that you want because if there's any brand
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.720]   associated with wanting as opposed to needing I
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.400]   want
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.920]   an apple
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.440]   Andy Inaco doing the universal signal for apple apple
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   We don't we can't make my hands do like you're doing the bike
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.240]   Maybe we can do like okay, so there's the there's the bite out and I got to do something for this if you're listening on audio
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.560]   It's better
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   Just imagine welcome to the Twitter Twitter the other yeah
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.160]   Also here for why more calm
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.360]   Renee Richie. He's got to throw up the gang sign. Oh, I like that's a good one. Not good at it. That's good
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.840]   Yo
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.040]   Yeah
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.320]   pull
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.240]   The app store icon
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.080]   This is good. We got a new one
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.880]   Also, also ang angstrom. So if we want to talk about wavelengths of light angstrom or apple
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.840]   So Renee did you get an invite?
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.520]   I I did not sad from bone. Andrew. Did you get an invite?
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.760]   Uh, I don't think I'm under I should say I didn't get it but not
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   Really because you got invited to the last one
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.720]   Didn't you last month?
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.640]   Well, the you know the the the the motion picture academy the fickle votership
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   Sometimes they do want the historical dramas, but you know you throw them a good feel good comedy with a tom hanks
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   And he's in there with a chance. So it's best not to try to predict the invitations have gone out to an october 22nd event
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.360]   As they are typically one week exactly ahead of time. Where's the event Renee?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.080]   You're bubb wina big one for the arts. Yeah bigger one. Yes, that's that's the one where the ipad was announced the iPhone
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.840]   No, not the iphone
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.640]   It's a little smaller than muscony west which is across the street much smaller. It's like maybe quarter the size
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.800]   Yeah, but but still bigger than one infinite loop the the last the the iphone announcement spot
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.320]   Yep, it's a factor of four every time you go up. I think the uh town hall is about 150
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.920]   year-for-win. I think is close to 500 maybe 600 and for the big room and at west hall they can get about 3000 there
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.440]   Is there anything
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.320]   Anything to read into that or is that just that's what they could get?
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   No, it's it's an adequate it's an adequate number of people to get in it's a manageable crowd once you have
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.960]   You can only get 3000 people in
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.280]   After you are either a letting in a lot of bozos who might who went right really stupid and irresponsible stuff
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.760]   One way or another or by simply letting the crowd come in and then it turns into you know
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.560]   Like the pre the warm-up crowd at the tonight show you don't want
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   Historical people this painting into into the into the aisle. It was the scene of my humiliation the ipad announcement in 2010
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.240]   uh
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.280]   And uh and uh the the invitation is very sparse as usual echriptic
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.720]   uh, it says we still have a lot to cover
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.760]   and shows the
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.600]   White the iconic white apple logo at the very the very top of it
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.320]   but spilling off of it the little stem
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.440]   in multiple pastel colors
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.960]   Any what are the tea what do those tea leaves tell you rene? What does that mean?
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.400]   I really try not to guess because I was saying before the show
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.440]   I think that people at apple kind of watch the stream go by and laugh and take shots every time we
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   get something crazy, but it's an ipad in a mac event and
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.800]   Pretty much everyone knows it's an ipad and a mac event
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   So I think they say we need an invitation. Oh last time we did an apple right with a bunch of splotches behind it
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   This time we'll do an apple with a bunch of leaves behind it
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.600]   I'm gonna differ here, but i'll let Andy go ahead
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Uh, i'm not gonna read it any into either
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.680]   I think that I think that the only thing that I would legitimately take away is that this is
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.840]   I really do think this is going to be a catch all sort of event where they've got a lot of things
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.680]   They got announced at the same time
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   none of which are
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.560]   Unless unless they really have a few on shoulder problem
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.280]   Yeah, and it's not like there's any one thing that would merit one hour in and of itself
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.640]   Uh, and although I would say that by by dramatically using a word that is easy for a new a bostonian to
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.800]   Pronouncing correctly kava
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.040]   Perhaps they're announcing that they are not really backing the red socks in for the s. Yes, you still have a lot to cover
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.680]   Uh, okay. Look at it again, and i'm gonna tell you exactly what this means it well
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.320]   There's two interpretations. There's the wild interpretation. It looks like the tale of the nbc peacock being shot off
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.800]   Which tells me that this is an apple tv event in which they're going to take on the major television networks
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.080]   This seems unlikely
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.960]   Well, it could be it could be also could be a commentary that disintegrate of their want disintegration of their once indomitable 39 comedy lineup
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.400]   Yeah
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.240]   That's perhaps it as well
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   And uh at this point i know in kupertino somebody's taking a shot
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.880]   Uh, but I think there's the middle ground. I see a lot of color here and I do think that given
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.840]   Uh apple's history this to me is an indicator that one of the ipads will be an ipads see I do believe
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.880]   I do believe there will be a color ipad. There's no evidence of this whatsoever i might add
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.840]   But it makes sense to me what happened when the ipod had kind of reached its maturity
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.520]   They split it out into the color nanos what or uh shuffles I guess it was at the time
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.720]   What happened what was no wasn't the shi minis minis the ipad minis were the first color ones right ipod minis
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.160]   Oh
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.560]   The nanokomatic as the one I remember yeah, I think the minis were in color
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:45.080]   Uh, that I think you're right and then and then of course we've seen the same thing happen now with the iphone the burst of color with the uh,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.920]   5c
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.800]   um
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.440]   I think they're up against a little bit of a wall because
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.960]   It's hard to imagine what you could do to the fourth generation ipad to make it a strong contender for uh new purchasers
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.640]   Maybe they don't need it to
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.720]   Well, the i the big ipad is getting a redesign and that's usually an easy sell so it's going to be much thinner smaller bezel much lighter
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.920]   It's going to be the same size screen, but the whole body will be different and people like
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.720]   Okay, and apple products get a redesign the ipad mini
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:19.080]   When the ipad mini came out the ipod touch got the color so the ipad mini took the high end space and apple usually reserves colors for their next
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.720]   They're more popular version not their higher end version and like you said there hasn't been any case leaks for multi colored ipad minis
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   But I wouldn't be surprised if they get maybe the gold and the space gray
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.400]   And if they keep the old ipad mini around as sort of a lower price option
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.880]   That'll probably stay the same. It's just a different problem to solve the iphone had to go plastic
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   Because making a transceivable material something that radio can go through as hard
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.280]   But no one really cares about a big plastic splotch in the back of an ipad so they don't have to make it easier to manufacture
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.600]   I predict that this is magician style misdirection
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   I think they're not going to do a mini retina much as we all want and hope and even rumor
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.200]   For the reasons you've quoted before rene
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.080]   There's no way to do it without a kind of hit and battery life
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.120]   And I don't think the laws of physics have been repealed nor have new battery technology has been invented so
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.320]   To distract us from the fact that the mini really is going to have much of an upgrade
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.560]   They're going to do it in color. How about that?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   I don't know. I mean because
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.160]   Realize that it's easy. It's easy to do a gold iphone five-bits
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.360]   It's easy to do a five-c in lots of garish colors
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   Because these are tiny pocketable devices and when your canvas make is suddenly this big or god forbid this big
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.920]   That means that that's a lot of gold to be you know
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.240]   Park behind in a conference room or an airport terminal. I think that I don't I think they'll go to space gray
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   I'm not sure if they'll go to gold for either of those two devices. Okay
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.040]   I'm not saying gold. I that's what rene said. I'm saying
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.760]   All these colors blue green
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   Perpet the iOS
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:03.160]   Yeah, the the other problem is that now it's a big wide range of colors makes a lot of sense for an inexpensive device like an ipod nano
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.760]   Or a $99 phone, but when you have a $500 device
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.200]   And now you're telling consumers that we know that you're going to really really want two of these colors
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.280]   Two of them that you'll be we'll kind of accept and there's one that will be like eating poison that you'll want to avoid
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.680]   I'm not sure if apple will want to put five different colors into the pipeline unless they knew for unless they they know that okay
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.200]   You know we're gonna make seven of the of the pepto bismol color
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.000]   We're gonna make five of the gum on the sidewalk that's been stepped on color
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.280]   We're gonna make lots of blue and lots of red and lots of yellow
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   Anything to the rumor that I think this was a bogus rumor that they had
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.520]   Cut back on production of the five-seat because it wasn't selling very well. I don't think that's true. Is it?
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   It's so the coverage of the iPhone 5c has been interesting because it seems like most people do not understand that as a product
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:56.440]   They look at it and they say oh, it's just another iPhone, but my understanding is it's meant for a completely different market
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.960]   It's not colorful people according to the ad well. No, not colorful
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.520]   It's meant for like it's meant to be a popular iPhone
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.640]   Which is not it's not supposed to be less expensive is supposed to be popular
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.960]   So it's supposed to you know be exciting and it's supposed to sit on the shelf in that clear ipad
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.600]   Sorry ipad like box and be bought throughout the year when you walk into a store and you see it
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.440]   It's not supposed to be ordered the first week or lined up for it's a long tail play and that's completely different for apple
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.760]   And I think that's really confused a lot of analysts. Yeah
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.880]   All right, I I think i'm just speculating on this invitation so
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:34.840]   It's a good one to speculate on because it's it's such a second tier event just so obviously I mean we don't
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.800]   Was it Andy though was it Andy? I mean in last year they re they except for the they they updated everything
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.600]   Yeah, and the new the new ipad was a surprise because everyone was going to guess two iPads in the same season
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.800]   Yeah, this is this is one which we we kind of know by process of elimination what has not been updated yet
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.880]   But nonetheless
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.120]   It's just as you're saying what can they do to the ipad many
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.720]   Outside of giving in a retina display. They'll get people really really excited about it again. Will they do a retina display?
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.200]   They will eventually
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.520]   They they they kind of have to because I think the the the slam dunk on this is that
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:15.000]   It is the only device apple cells that runs ios 7 and does not have a retina display
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.080]   And I know it's it's kind of obvious when you when I look back at it
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.040]   But as i've been now putting ios 7 on everything that I have
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   It's the only one where there's sort of you know
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:30.040]   It's like a bug flying up your nose when you find when you see ios 7 and non retina portions
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.520]   So that in and of itself might make apple
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.920]   Even if the i'm not sure that they would go for a huge
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.960]   Downcast in battery life
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.360]   But to have the ipad many still for sale over the christmas season with that kind of
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.280]   That's i still not a bad display, but boy does ios 7 does not show it off to its greatest advantage
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:59.000]   That's that's the point in favor of seeing retina on the ipad many despite even if it does not 45 minutes off the battery life
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.080]   Maybe maybe they could do enough savings with ios 7 to simply say that we in our testing given that we're running ios 7
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.720]   Studley applications that have been updated to take advantage of some of the new power saving modes
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.640]   We can say yes triumphantly. We're giving you the exact same battery life as before
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.600]   And all these you know google is doing it. Okay, uh, kindle. Excuse me amazon is doing it. Okay
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.520]   It's gonna be really really hard for them to put this off past january
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.280]   What do you think rene?
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.760]   No, I know I agree with Andy. I mean as far as I know they've got
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:35.240]   prototypes for new ipad minis with and without retina and you know they can make it slightly thicker like they did the ipad
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.840]   Three and four and ios 7 does a lot and the new processors do a lot to help battery life
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.680]   And you know, there's no new battery technology
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.440]   But apple is really really really good at working around doing everything they can
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.720]   Putting stuff to sleep pushing it off to the side making co-processors that take load off the main cpu
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.840]   They won't chip anything that gets seven hours of battery life
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   But they might ship something that has you know nine hours of battery life at least as a
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.560]   a step towards the next generation one
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:08.120]   I'm trying to parse that are they gonna do it? I
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:16.200]   Or not I will I think it's likely likely. I will okay likely. Okay. Like you don't have to say definite definitively likely
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.320]   I like what do you say Andy? I would take that bet
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.400]   uh
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.840]   I wouldn't again if I if I had 10 grand for betting I would
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.760]   Buy a couple of mac pros and maybe bet only $2,000
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.840]   One mac pro for that dude. I've had many let's not go crazy
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.720]   That's right. We want we want to get the one with 4k of ram. They're right not the 2k of ram
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.080]   Uh, yeah
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.920]   I don't I don't think it's a slam dunk because the the the the the random factor here is that apple is an absolutely no pressure
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.880]   to do anything with the ipad many that they themselves internally do not want to do
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   because
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:01.000]   They're getting a little bit more pressure from from amazon now because the uh, uh, kindle fire seven inch hdx is getting really strong reviews and
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.920]   It's something pretty well, but it's but the ipad many is still its own product
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.960]   With that they they will have no difficulty selling in whatever quantity no matter what they do with it
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.560]   So it's not as though they absolutely have to go retina this season
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.400]   But there it's gonna be pressures on with amazon and google doing it the pressure the pressure the pressure is on
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.040]   But again, the the mitigating factor is that
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.800]   We're asked with the the iphone you can legitimately say that
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:34.680]   On on some level the iphone 5s is just another really really good premium smartphone in a world in which there are at least six really good premium
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.160]   Smartphones there are still only one ipad many there is still only one ipad
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.200]   Uh, if you want a tablet computer that does real productive stuff that does the whole gamut of stuff
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.520]   There really is only one choice at this point
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.960]   Uh, and so for that reason that's the argument for them saying
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.160]   We would love to have we would love to have had the retina ipad many ready for for the holidays
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.680]   It's just not ready yet
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.200]   And we'd rather take the p we'd rather take the hit of a few people complaining that this is still not retina
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.080]   Then take the hit of everybody saying gee how come this is only getting eight and a half hours with a battery life
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:13.320]   You'll one got 10 hours of battery life and the interesting thing also is the ipad the ipad 5 is going to be much smaller
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.000]   It is going to be much later and much smaller
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.040]   It will be an ipad mini and everything but screen size and a lot of people might look at that and say
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.680]   I want to watch video. I want to read comic books
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.800]   I like the bigger screen and now it's finally light enough and small enough for me to do it on that and that could
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.440]   That would be attractive package
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.560]   It'll it'll be a factor. I don't think most people are complaining
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.680]   It'll still be too heavy to hold it with one hand for the duration of reading a book or watching a movie
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.600]   I think most people's complaints about it aren't so much the thickness or the weight
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.640]   But this but the size that there is absolutely no pocket and any rational garment that you own
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.440]   Which you can stick a set again. I'm wearing my file
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.280]   Pants. Oh, yes, I can get that in the back back in the back back pockets of some of my pants
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.400]   But still even the even the ipad mini is a little bit on the big side in terms of pocketable
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.360]   But at least it's manageable doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have to carry
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.640]   Some sort of large bag to carry it around in uh, we're asking ipad mini gives you that
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.040]   Hmm
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.720]   I'm going to go out in the limit. I'm going to say there is no retina ipad mini
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.920]   There is one. I just don't know if we'll see it in this this year
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.400]   This is how I'm obviously talking about someday in the year 25 25 if man is still alive if women can survive
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.520]   There will be a retina mini, but i'm going to go. I'm going to say this this week from today. No
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.680]   But re re re re and I agree that there is
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:43.160]   Their apple has the ability to ship a retina ipad if they wanted to this season. I'm sure they
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.720]   I'm sure they built them. I'm sure they figured them out
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.440]   I don't I don't think you're I don't think you're wrong leo. I'm just saying that again
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.120]   It's it's one of those things for flip flip a coin 10 times
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.000]   I think that six or seven times out of 10
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.240]   It's going to come up retina ipad mini. It's then three times it's going to come up
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.760]   Not i'm not sure at all
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.840]   And I will point out like my mom is going to get one and she does not she wouldn't notice it was retina or not
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.120]   She doesn't care. I've mentioned it to her and she's like, I just want the mini because it's small
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.240]   Right
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.520]   And that's how much bigger audience for the ipad mini than i'm just feeling the vibe, man
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.920]   I just feeling the vibe. I don't feel it
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.680]   You're feeling lucky
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.360]   Everything on black everything i'm black. I would you know I would
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.240]   Uh, but but you know, I just I don't feel like that's going to happen
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.880]   um
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.240]   Maybe I should buy a mini and then that way it would happen do it leo
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:39.800]   It's it could be that close. It's just waiting for the little nudge weather. Yeah
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.720]   Oh leo bought it. Let's do it. Yeah, um, I I do think that's an interesting premise though
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.160]   Renee that the new big ipad will be
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.720]   Slimer noticeably slimmer and small enough that it may satisfy the urge
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.640]   And that's why I think probably there isn't as much pressure to do a retina mini
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.560]   Uh, I think they're going to do color background minis. They're gonna it's going to be that it's going to be like the five c
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.760]   Just my thought
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.000]   All right, we got we have there's a lot more rumors to cover and of course we haven't talked about the other thing that they're almost
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.880]   Certainly going to announce in one week and that's the mac pro
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.680]   We will talk about that in just a little bit
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.320]   um
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.400]   But first a word from square sei thinking about stuff, but I I want I'm gonna save this for after the ad

[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.240]   Plus it's got the greatest software on top of it
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.280]   Just fabulous

[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.320]   Uh, can I ask a favor?
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.240]   Use the word mac break 1 0 mac break 10 because we're in october
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   And because you'll get 10 off
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:41.160]   That's why the annual plan looks pretty good at this point mac break 10 10 percent off when you decide to buy at square space
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.040]   dot com
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:51.640]   So one analyst or no no, I guess it's one website is making crazy predictions and I almost don't even I didn't include them in our
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.680]   rundown because they're so crazy about this event next week including
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.480]   uh strange
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   availability days like wednesday
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   Uh
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:10.920]   Do we have any uh any insight rene you get a lot of you get a lot of tips any insight into that into mac pro
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.560]   They were saying the mac pro available mid-november
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.600]   Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me the ios stuff is usually available 10 days after the event
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.360]   Whatever the friday is you know the second friday after the event the mac pro has less pressure because
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.080]   You know, no one has to line up to buy that and it's not necessarily something you get someone as a christmas present
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.960]   So it's it's basically immune to their holiday cycle. It'll probably come out sometime
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.440]   Are like let's him as the iMac did last year. So you know later on in november
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.800]   I'm saving my pennies right now. I cannot wait to get one
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.960]   I need an apple line of credit. I mean they should offer that as a service because we know it's going to be pricey
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.240]   Yeah
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.560]   Uh scooter x in our chat room says he saw gravity and nimax 3d yesterday and they had two ads in it a windows 8 ad
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.440]   And an apple mac pro ad the one we've talked about before he said the mac pro ad got it up
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.520]   Got applause got an ovation
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:07.480]   It's audacious scooter x must be in a in la or uh, new york somewhere where there's a lot of creative types
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   Please give us a mac pro
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.360]   Um, I would I i'm excited about the mac pro. I think it sounds like a beautiful device
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.320]   I don't know if it's going to be a bestseller or if it's even going to
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.240]   Sav the wounded pride of the creative community
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.840]   I'm still i'm still lobbying for absent all evidence of this a bundle that includes all the software
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   But we'll see it wouldn't be inappropriate
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:43.640]   And I there's so much excitement in the in the 1% community and we're here. We're talking not not the economic 1%
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:52.760]   No, I I mean the I mean the computational 1% the people for whom i'm sorry, but the
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.560]   Time progressing at the rate of 1 second per second is simply not fast enough for us
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.040]   We need time to progress at two seconds per second
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.760]   And I've not I've not spoken to anybody in that category who had an opinion on the on the mac pro that was not
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:13.960]   Hugely supportive. I mean, right every all these people in my twitter stream like all their conversations, especially now have turned to
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.600]   Now i've got now i've got about 18 terabytes of
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.280]   Storage should I convert all of them to thunderbolt or some of them to three
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.240]   Usb three and some to thunderbolt and some to sada
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.920]   And it's it's like they're they're just they're just champion at the bit
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:37.640]   It's like they they they they've got all this money that they've already been primed and they've been primed itself to throw their money at somebody
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.320]   For something mac pro related and now they're just so horny for it right now that I need a new desk
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.240]   Please take my money for a new mac pro. Do you do you think that's easy to do an absent of a price
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   And once you see a price there may be a little bit of a
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.520]   Slow down on that unless I mean unless they go like lisa pricing
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.120]   Yeah, they're not gonna do yeah because realize that at this for the 1%ers. It's not a case of
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.680]   Saving up your money and having your dream computer and how it'll fit in your desk
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:13.320]   It really is I can convert a $5,000 computer into $20,000 more of invoices in the first three months
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.720]   And so that is just the fastest money you can possibly spend i'm saving room on my desk
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.760]   Not everyone's gonna buy like even with the last mac pro not everyone bought the eight skew or the six
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.320]   The sorry the 18 eight core the 12 core model with everything maxed out. They'll be a really good
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.840]   You know second tier version of this you think so you think they'll have a kind of a base model. It's acceptable. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.800]   Yeah, then that would that that's the home theater pc
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.160]   The very defensive
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.560]   That's that no that's that's the I want you to know how much money I spent on this home theater pc
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:49.560]   Like here's here here's one example of every Batman costume actually used in every Batman movie
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.400]   Here is my my medium room shaped like the console the millennium falcon and these are my nine mac bros
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.200]   Right i can switch between nine four k streams
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.480]   At the nine four k screams you need that computer handy
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   And let's not forget that the other thing that they will certainly announce is mavericks
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   Yeah, we we're already gold master right when I was gone didn't they ship the gold master last week. Yeah
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.080]   So that means what do you think on that time frame? Will they uh now it's
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.880]   I mean that typically apple. I mean this case apple would want to announce new compete
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:27.960]   No, they already announced i max they've just updated the the macbook airs so it would be the macbook pro
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:35.160]   Maybe if they announced a new mac and then the mac pro and what many and the oh mini that's right
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.840]   Are they do for an update on the mini it has well mini. Yep
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.800]   So, uh, what do you think on mavericks next week or month out?
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.120]   I wouldn't be surprised if it was announced at the if it was available at the event if not available
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.440]   I'm certain we'll get a date usually last few years
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.440]   They've done it right after the conference call but this year's conference call is you know a couple weeks later
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.880]   So I wanted the event is a 20 second. I'm gonna predict that thursday the 24th
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   We will all get the little uh ping. Hey, you have an update and we'll be $20
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   I'd say 20 or 30
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   It's not it's they're gonna stick to their usual
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.320]   Rate of we're gonna encourage everybody to who has compatible hardware to install this update
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.440]   Yeah, i'm not gonna make that a challenge right and also this this is a
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.800]   I've actually read a couple rumors that they're gonna release it like
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.000]   Late this week. Oh, which is which is which is silly. I mean, they're you got an announcement
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.320]   Okay, exact because not not not only an announcement
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.160]   There's so many cool new features that aren't that that aren't the sort of thing you can put into like a little screenshot on
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.000]   The website that they really are going to want to spend a good half hour
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.360]   On stage demonstrating here is a core technology that makes mavericks better than the than the previous edition ever was
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.880]   And what are the uh, what are the what's the feedback on the gold masters everybody happy any uh
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.520]   Seam reliable and so forth so on
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.440]   I know a lot of people who are who are actually developers who are actually confident enough to have installed it not just on their
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.080]   Test machine now on their their daily drivers. Yeah
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:15.560]   I'm excited again. They're they're always there always those bugs. They're they're only become visible when the user base expands from tens of thousands
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.760]   To hundreds of thousands slash millions right but uh, I mean we saw that we saw that with ios 7 didn't we?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.600]   Yeah, of course big big surprises big show stuffers
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.320]   Oh, you know that that startup screen is so beautiful. It's just good. The people get another opportunity to see it
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:37.160]   I am by the way we can now uh loving the uh, the fingerprint reader works so well
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.640]   I never want to enter a uh past code again
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:46.120]   I want it on everything leo I do and of course somebody has uh released at htc is announced on the htc one max
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.800]   Which is a 5.9 inch phone even bigger than the galaxy no three
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:58.120]   And which if you compare it by the way to an iphone already looks like something went wrong in the steroid factory horse
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   Uh
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.040]   I can't even imagine a 5.9 inch screen
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.120]   But they put the fingerprint reader it's that same kind of stripe reader you might have seen on the uh
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.640]   On the laptops before and uh everybody's saying it's kind of not it's kind of crappy it's atrix
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.560]   Atrix good. It's hard to reach and you end up swiping over the camera lens all the time, which is not optimal
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.080]   It's just apple did it right and I guess that's what apple is so good
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.760]   They didn't do it to be a feature checkbox or to make use of a specific technology
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.880]   They had a feature they wanted and they worked out the way that they wanted to do it
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.000]   And that's a very different approach, but it usually ends up making better results surprise. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   Which which begs the question would it be appropriate for them to put the fingerprint reader on the new ipads? Yes, I wonder do you think
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.520]   I think so because I want it
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.560]   On on the one hand when you have it on it's a it's a net more natural fit for a phone because the phone is something you are
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.120]   More tactile with me. You're taking it out of your pocket your thumb is probably there anyway
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.360]   But I think that after seeing how apple presented that feature last month
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.640]   Uh, I think that that's a stronger bet for the new ipads only because they're not simply saying well
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:10.520]   This makes perfect sense for a phone. They're saying that we want to help make past make right devices more secure and easier to use
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.400]   One of the big because the ipad now because the ipad also uses a passcode
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:21.960]   That means that it can also benefit from fingerprint reading too does apple in its decisions consider
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:28.360]   The things that many other companies have like well, let's see if we do the fingerprint reader this year
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.040]   What are we gonna do next year? We need to keep something do they hold stuff back?
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.360]   I don't think because they don't have enough resources to put it out now
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.920]   They don't do it for for revenue reasons. They don't do it for cynical like well
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.280]   We're gonna hold it back so we have something for next time if they had to try and do everything it wants
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.480]   Right, they do it because they feel as though it's ready and they feel as though this is the right time for it
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   I don't feel as though there's
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.520]   Given given that they're they at this point they know they're gonna get dinged
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.920]   Even if they're even if they're the new ipad
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.600]   Well, you know it only hovers off the ground for eight feet for only a day. I mean
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.400]   Everyone apple used to innovate
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.360]   So I mean they've they've always they're when they're from the signature features of apples that they've always been on their own timetable
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.960]   They don't respond right when they respond to the market. It's not that
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.280]   Oh, this cut this guy came up with a larger screen phone
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.920]   We've got to come up with a larger screen phone for them even there
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.480]   They will respond to the size of new phones by looking at how people are interacting with these new 4.8 years phones
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.400]   These new 5.9 inch phones and then letting that inform what they're gonna do next
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.440]   So that they're they're immune to that sort of you think there's enough supply of these fingerprint readers to put it in the ipad
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.960]   It's not the fingerprint like from you need an a7 chipset in order to have touch ID work
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.240]   So if there's an a7 chipset and they'll probably be an a7x chipset in the ipad 5
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.840]   That makes it a good candidate
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.320]   I don't know what the chipset's gonna be in the ipad mini because the ipad mini is currently in a5
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.640]   So it's next logical chipset is the a6 which does not support touch ID
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.360]   Otherwise they're jumping to processor generations
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.480]   Which is more expensive and put higher it puts higher demand on their ability to manufacture those chipsets
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.280]   So here's my prediction
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.040]   fingerprint reader in the big ipad but not in the mini
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.280]   No retina in the mini, but you're gonna have color backs
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.000]   No
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.360]   Well, we'll send you we'll see if we can set you up an endorsement deal with cry law
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.560]   You have any color back you want might screw up the lens a bit
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.360]   You'll get your color. I really think it's hard
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.320]   I I mean from a pure if there is no supply constraint and there's no cost constraint in other words
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.640]   If there's nothing to hold them back from doing it from from a you know logistics point of view
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.440]   It seems like it's a must-do because you really want to have that fingerprint reader across the board
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.800]   I'm really tired of entering my passcode into my ipad mini now
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.160]   It's annoying after using this for one week after using ff5
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.560]   See for s for one week. So I can only imagine what that's gonna feel like across the board
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.040]   They gotta put it in the ipad mini is already one of the lower margin apple products
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.320]   So my question is if you put a retina display in there and the technology is supported
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   It's expensive if you put an a7 in there and the touch ID it's expensive
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:10.040]   So does apple actually bump the price up for a retina ipad mini with touch ID and then live leave this ipad mini
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.240]   The current generation on the market the way they did the ipad too
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:19.960]   So they still have a lower cost of entry model for schools and for people for whom those features are just not worth the extra money
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.760]   Also, it's I think that this is a good opportunity for apple to underscore
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:31.160]   The supremacy of the full-sized ipad by saying we're gonna put the a7 chip inside the full-sized ipad
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.200]   That's gonna get every feature pretty almost every feature
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Non-camera related that the iphone 5s has and that's where that's why we're charging 500 dollars for this
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.520]   Were us other 10 inch 9 inch tablets are going for 300 to 400 dollars
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.760]   um, they they do have to maintain line on the ipad mini because if they
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:56.120]   If they disc if they devolve the value of that device anywhere, that's gonna be not disaster
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.200]   But that's going to be an opportunity for all makers of the smaller tablets that are doing
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.480]   They're doing pretty okay given the supremacy of the ipad mini
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.320]   So it's sound i'm i'm gonna guess just base in all of this
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.880]   That really the focus is going to be on the still on the 10 inch ipad
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.080]   And that the mini I think you're right. I think they need to keep the price down
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   I don't see them doing a retina mini. I really don't and I don't see them putting a fingerprint reader on it
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.280]   Uh, why bother is the mini that important?
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:33.640]   We've heard rumors that in the past that it's outselling the 10 inch. Yeah, I mean I love my mini if it were retina
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:40.840]   I do think it's the size that speaks to people in a way that the 9.7 inch does not yeah, it's not just this
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:47.640]   It's the size. It's the price. It's the way that people are it's the way that mainstream consumers are interacting with tablets these days
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.800]   They're not thinking of it in terms of this big
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.960]   Device with desktop computer style power
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.040]   Uh, I mean that's that obviously the 9.7 inch still runs ios and technically mobile apps
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.960]   But no no bones about it really does has asper does have aspirations to be the desktop computer
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.680]   the the desktop power computer
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.560]   Uh that that we've all been wanting in the 21st century
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.400]   So i'm it's it's it's it's really is going to be all about figuring out what it is about this device that speaks to this
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:23.320]   This this demographic and I really do think that that answer is ipad mini not full size ipad
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   So if if with one way to continue to make the ipad into an important product is to say
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:35.800]   We are not going to we are we're not going to care about any consideration other than having equality the best mobile processor
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.000]   We have our we we have access to we'll go into the ipad the best features that we have access to
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.920]   We'll go into the full size ipad. We will cut excuse me not cut corners, but we will allow ourselves not to
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.760]   Take that hard line attitude with the ipad mini for so many good valid reasons price point size
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.160]   That sort of thing but the ipad
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:01.800]   The full-sized ipad has to be the device that justifies a 500 dollar to 865 price tag
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.680]   Right it's our most forward looking ipad yet and I apologize. I'm just playing a game
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.520]   It's a stupid game. We'll know in seven days. It's just it's not so it's fun. This is fun
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.640]   This is why it's fun
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.040]   I mean there's there's there's a reason why you don't like turn on the turn on the game like the
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.360]   All game like in the middle of the sixth inning and third office and as you know that someone has an insurmountable
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.120]   On you turn in you you want to hear Bob you agree you want to hear Vince scully
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:29.080]   You want to hear people talk about what they think is going to happen because you are actively interested in this sort of thing
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   And it's and it's yet another it's yet another testimony to how well apple designs as products that we can have this sort of
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.600]   In both an intellectual and an emotional response to it
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.800]   We actually care about what apple is going to be releasing next week
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.760]   And we were so so excited about it that you know the three of us are willing to spend an hour talking about it
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.320]   And not having to blah blah blah fill time. Okay. I'm not gonna
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.000]   All of the audience judge for that
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.440]   But the audience is willing to is eager to listen to people talking about this on this another podcast for hours at a time
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.760]   So well done apple
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:08.600]   We there's no podcast about cantaloupe in which we talk about you know del mante is doing a wonderful thing with clear plastic coating to
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.600]   share prices from from the Honduras
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:20.200]   Uh, is there anything else to say about this uh, Tuesday announcement except that we will be doing live coverage of course as always
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.280]   That's the most fun and by the way our biggest audience every time. Thank you apple
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.440]   Uh
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.280]   Probably starting at 9 30 a.m. Pacific 1230
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.000]   Eastern time
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.480]   Uh, 1330 UTC
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.120]   Uh, tuesday the 22nd
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:43.800]   On twit.tv, please join us live and I don't know chad we even started thinking about the panel for that
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   We've started thinking we don't have anyone nailed for cogitating. Yes, and since neither of these two are going to be available
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.800]   I'm saying I contentedly say I'll probably be available sometimes and
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.160]   Jammy's and and live tweets it, but I haven't checked my I haven't checked my spam filter yet, but it's possible that I'll be available
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:08.280]   With access to high high speed broadband on on tuesday, uh, do you think they'll stream it? They didn't stream last month
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.920]   I don't see why they would stream it. They can't stream from apple campus. It's just they apparently can't experience
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   Yeah, so the last time they were at your bib one and they did stream it be nice if they did
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.880]   The one thing I haven't heard well one thing I'm still
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   The one thing I would like to see is a 4k apple display because retina is too hard for iMac and for thunderbolt
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:33.080]   But 4k still has a marketing zing to it and it's um, it's understood and it's way less pixels than retina
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:39.240]   And the mac pro happens to support three of them. So I think it with all the talk of apple t television got to do a 4k
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.680]   Yes, yeah, I think that would be that would be my wild card for the
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.920]   The thing that makes the geeks all very very happy with apple again and they bundle that
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.960]   With the software and i'm really happy
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.400]   I can't wait to never talk in lisa level prices
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:02.920]   I I definitely see them doing a 4k display to sell the total ultimate package considered not not just for people editing 4k
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.360]   4k video, but also the idea of having
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.560]   In one single final cut window. We're going to give you full hd over here then full hd of this other clip over here
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.880]   And then big interface over there
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.480]   But uh, I think that right now though 4k is not a consumer facing sort of thing yet
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.560]   So I don't think I don't think they would position it as something that people would want to actually own right now
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.600]   We should point out that mavericks does have wallpaper at 51 20 by 2880
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.040]   Hmm
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.560]   Do they really want to do like a point one update just to update, you know the wallpaper in eight months?
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:47.640]   They already don't care about the disposition of the free space on our hard drives
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.320]   They're going to do that 4k displays exist. There are companies making those
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.080]   Yes, they'll definitely and they'll I'm sure if you plug a 4k display into the new mac pro
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.960]   It'll do
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.440]   Well, and why would apple leave that money on the table?
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.520]   I mean, why would they let you go buy an Asus 4k display when they could make one?
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.800]   I I agree, but keeping keeping our expectations in the right place
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.640]   I think they would definitely sell it as a this is this is this is a display that sells that sells for an ungodly amount of money
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.960]   But is what certainly one of the best 4k displays you can buy today, right?
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.440]   I don't think I don't think they would say that they would sell it as a thing that anybody who again cannot can not immediately
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.560]   Who will hear this announcement and not immediately think and if I spend
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.080]   $1,000 for that display I can immediately do this this $18,000 job
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.800]   That I didn't think that we had the manpower for because now we all managed this workflow very very nicely
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.360]   But we we haven't talked about apple tv though
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.240]   Yes, I would love to see next week
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   I don't know. I would love to see it though that we can talk speculatively. I mean, I've not seen anything firm about it
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.920]   There's there've been some fluttering rumors about a refresh to the hardware
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.240]   And there's always there's always rumors about this the evergreen
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.800]   rumor is all about new content deals
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:12.840]   But this is also a space in which apple is real if they really are serious about the apple tv they're gonna have to just keep
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:20.920]   dumping fuel into that turbocharger and moving this device forward forward forward because there's so much movement in
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:27.880]   Competition there and also this is one space in which people do not have any sort of an emotional allegiance towards any device
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.880]   I mean, it has it had to have resonated with some people inside apple that
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:39.000]   That the the chrome cast is 30 35 dollar device is just selling selling selling even though it's not the best
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.640]   Streaming device out there people want to plug this device into their tv's and they seem to be using it as well as as well as buying it
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.600]   Western digital has a really lovely box that
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.880]   They should promote better because I had completely forgotten about it until I was asking people online
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.360]   I'm doing a i'm taking a look at other other streaming boxes. What do you like and then I see this this western digital box that wow
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.920]   It actually does more things in the app. It has a couple of features. I wish the apple tv head
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.880]   You still amazon is another perennial rumor is
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:15.000]   Rumor to be winded again to the set top box business because they have all that wonderful digital content that they want to sell you and
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.520]   Just like the kindle makes it very really greases the rails towards
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:25.400]   Using all that stuff you're paying for with your amazon prime membership and also to greasing the rails towards buying more stuff and getting
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.080]   The locked into their dr. Darham format. So they're certainly going to be coming up with something if not this season certainly soon
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.960]   So apple really can't treat apple tv like a hobby anymore. They have to treat it like a top
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:42.520]   Not a top tier product, but at least something that's saddled that satellite the in orbit of a top tier product
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.120]   So few they're pulling the strings andy. They're pulling all the strings. Yes, bores carla threads
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:54.520]   It just feels like that it's it's a hobby because they don't they sold what 13 million of them
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.400]   It's not this tiny numbers. It's not
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.520]   Yeah, but even if it's the number and it is by dom it's totally dominates even roku
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:07.160]   But it's still a tiny number for apple compared to how much the iphones. Yeah
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.720]   Yeah, yeah, I mean inside apple
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.600]   Like you you have like sauron on top of the tower and his eye is either looking at you or it's looking at something else
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.200]   And you're left alone in the cold in the dark you want the eye to look at you in this case
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.880]   If you want a big apple tv push you need to have that eye looking at you
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.960]   Um and it's not clear like they have a tenet p apple tv at a hundred bucks
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.440]   It's not clear what they're gonna do because the sdk sounds like it's up on bricks in the apple driveway
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.000]   So there won't be developer apps and
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.040]   Do you need a 4k apple tv yet when there's no content for it and new content deals?
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.440]   They're adding stuff all the time outside of events
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.040]   Do they need a new chipset in it when it already handles tenet p well?
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.800]   I mean unless it's too expensive to make old chipsets and they just this is anyway
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.040]   I would guess this the stuff that wd tv does that you like andy is stuff apple will never do like playing content
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.920]   Uh, but that's that's downloaded
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:03.640]   To me that's to me that's part of the problem too that all the other competing competing devices
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.240]   They're not it's not necessarily they've open sourced their software development gift
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.280]   But it's so easy to get a new app on the roku box
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.320]   It's so easy to get to make a deal to get a device to get something that will work on chromecast
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:23.720]   Whereas it is a news event when we get a new thing that at a new channel that works on apple tv apple can't apple
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.880]   apple can't
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.120]   Be quite so selective
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.320]   Uh, I think in adding new content to the apple tv
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.360]   They really do have to make it easier for developers to create something that works great with the apple tv right now
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.040]   The the best solution that people have is to well what you want to do is you want to buy an iphone or you want to buy an ipad
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.200]   And therefore and there's a number of ios apps that will airplay that content
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:52.440]   I mean I've which i'm now i've now totally broken myself of the habit of watching project runway like even on my dvr
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.040]   Now it it really is i will take my i'll take my ipad living room
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.120]   I will stream it from the from the lifetime app. I don't even but i don't even bother to record it anymore
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.920]   It would be my guess that the that the time frame is not
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.600]   Being dictated by apple but by the networks by the content deals that apple has been
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.920]   For a year we've been hearing apple rumors about apple trying to make these content deals
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.960]   And that's the big jump on apple tv was suddenly it streams live from nbc cbs abc
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:24.440]   Fox that kind of thing and I think that's what's holding it up and I think that's what's dictating the time frame not apple
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.680]   I have noticed i'm like andi i don't have cable anymore. I just have the apps
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.840]   I have ctv and global all the canadian networks and before you couldn't airplay them
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.800]   You had to wash them on the device and then one by one they had an airplay
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.880]   So now if I want to watch agents of shield until I decide it's no longer worth watching
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.400]   I can just have the worst taste in television. I've ever heard i can put the mirror
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.480]   I will not have you denigrate tim
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   If you had that sweet sweet man on triangulation
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.600]   Your heart would grow three sizes my friend
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.720]   Don't do not stand for it, andi
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.960]   I don't know i don't know tim gun, but i would like to know tim gun because he's
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.600]   I believe that he's one hell of a guy
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.280]   All right, there is somebody everybody's following on twitter all of a sudden
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.360]   apple has
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.120]   Or will have next year a new senior vice president of retail
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit andi nakos here from the chicago tons sine times project runway lover
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   Uh also here from apologetic unapologetic
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.040]   apologetically runway tim gun fan
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:32.600]   Uh and from montreal and i'm more.com rene richie who's an apologetic agents of shield fan
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.960]   I have to apologize for that. It's just not been good enough
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.880]   And that's why we trust bernay's opinions on things he will say
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.960]   No what
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.520]   Andy and i may not agree on television, but we do agree on one thing that's audiobooks from audible.com
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.200]   We live the audible life

[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.320]   entertainment and i have to say there's such
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.920]   wonderful stuff on audible.com they've added
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.560]   uh as you know they've added uh
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.320]   Uh the great courses i've been i when i was in um in greece i listened to the great courses
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:33.480]   Uh, i listened to a college lecture series on home raziliad as i was wandering troy
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.520]   That was awesome stuff like that is fantastic. They're adding some interesting things
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.320]   um, damey and luis of homeland is narrating
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.120]   uh an audible short
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.720]   It's free you can get it right now called homeland phantom pain
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.680]   I don't know if this is fan fiction
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.080]   um
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.400]   This is this is really interest it's an interesting
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.160]   uh
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:03.960]   move by uh homeland is one of my favorite tv shows and that one i will unapologetically back just back on the year
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.400]   um
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.640]   This is an interesting promotional tie-in i would guess
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.360]   So audible's always doing new stuff. They have uh famous speeches on here
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.600]   They have fabulous college courses on here and of course best
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.960]   Sellers to great novels. I'm listening also to uh inside
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:26.920]   Scientology by janet riteman, which is wow. What a story that is a great book about uh
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.640]   The uh america's fastest growing religion
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.560]   Annie, what are you listening to at audible? We always like to hear what andy's picks are
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.760]   Uh, I just started a few days ago this brand new biography of jim henson just came out
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.000]   school jim henson colin at the biography by brian j jones
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.920]   Um, which I think would make i'm only about five chapters in it
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.720]   I think uh, but I think it would make a really great companion piece to the uh isexans
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   biography of steve jobs
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.920]   Because there there two people that you kind of think of in the same sort of category
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:05.960]   Intensely creative people who wound up having to create a huge corporate empire
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.080]   Uh, but who also maintain an idea that these are the principles that got me into this business
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.680]   This is what I want to achieve not just with this company, but with my life
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:19.320]   Um, and it doesn't help it doesn't hurt that you know, you grew up watching the muppets
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.480]   You were watching sesame street you transitioned into the muppets and now you're watching the movies
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:31.320]   Uh, that the that his work and the the work of the people that work in the studios that he created are such a touchstone to your life
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.560]   So, uh, it has this it has the same
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.120]   I wouldn't say problem but the same sort of timeline you have in any biography where
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.320]   You're you have to eat your vegetables before you get to the meat and then to the dessert. So yes, you do have to spend the first
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:50.120]   Uh, uh, um, the brassco is a lonely place to grow up, especially if you're a young sensitive artistic kid
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.440]   And a puppeteer
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.440]   It was founded in 1922 by tenor and railway workers like i'm gonna read this
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:02.200]   I'm gonna read because at some point I get to find out I get to read about script conferences for the first muppet show
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.440]   And then I get to find out about rolf the dog puppet now. I'll then then get to read about them up in movie
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   I have to read about the
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.720]   The dust bowl that affected his great great grandfather. I wish they would do that just start in the middle
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.520]   It's it's okay. It's okay because you do you you are a product of your family
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.360]   You are a product of the place that you grew up in
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:26.920]   There are a lot about bad biographies that go too far about that. I mean there's the rosebud syndrome where you know
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:31.720]   Somewhere in some interview some cousin mentioned that at some picnic when he was eight
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.280]   He happened to have a baseball cap and they want to
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:39.720]   But it turns out that that green felt baseball cap would become the fixation of his entire
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.800]   No, it was just a green baseball
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.920]   This is something that even modern novelists could learn from home
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.200]   You start in media race in the middle of things
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.600]   You know start at the good stuff stuff anyway, I'm sure it's gonna be great
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.320]   And I am absolutely downloading and listening frank auss said
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.520]   It was great. I mean here's a guy who really knows this is that's that's why this is an important biography
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.680]   Because it really I'm not sure if it was you would call it an authorized biography
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.760]   But he got interviews with with uh with uh with him
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:14.200]   Henson's widow, but now she's gone a bunch of other key personnel who are no longer with us
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.240]   He managed to talk to everybody that would that would be important to talk to
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:23.000]   So you don't get the same perspective that like a call of mccollibography of harry truemen gets
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.120]   You know 50 years later when everybody's either dead or has no reason not to speak candidly
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.800]   But in in terms of a really broadly encompassing story of one person's life
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:39.560]   Informed by people who knew him very very well as opposed to people who just you know grew up watching him
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.280]   I think this is a great show. It really is quite entertaining. I can't wait before five chapters. I read so far
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:49.000]   21 hours too. It's a nice long I like long books and audible get you get some value

[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.680]   I wish though that I I got to like make a fake binding to put on the on the wall in my
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.160]   My bookshelves so because it looks like I don't read books anymore
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:38.200]   What they should at least do is like after you've like been a better member for like let's say one year
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:44.520]   Yeah, they mail you like a carrot kind of like Febreze or aerosol spray that makes your makes your your whatever room in your house smell like
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.480]   Leather binding there you go. How can he book shelves? There you go
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   These people know that you're one of them classy sons a bit
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.720]   It looks like I stopped reading in 2001 when I started becoming an audible subscriber
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.800]   I've read lots of books since then I know 50 years since then but
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.680]   I don't get credit for it. Exactly
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.560]   I really like
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.680]   I would I would subscribe to this if if amazon had this
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.400]   Amazon and now audible and audible is an amazon company
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.600]   But if they had some sort of thing where just like they will mail you like a cloth merit badge type of patch
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.480]   Every time that you can prove that you read to the end of every Kindle book and listen to the end of an album
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.760]   I would so I could at least like wear like that sash and keep sewing
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:29.320]   They do in the audible app. They have badges now. So it's kind of like I watch a lot of reality television
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:33.000]   But hey, you know, you know, I've forgotten how to read. Yes. Hey, I still read
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.320]   Right, you see that
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:40.040]   You got to have some brain ecological stuff up here and get right from the right you can and uh
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.800]   Thank you spider who just sent me a links to a website books by the foot.com where you can just buy your books
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.720]   You don't have to read them by the foot and just fill up your bookshelf as if
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.720]   Yeah, I don't think there is such a thing. It's classy with a capital queue right there
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.880]   I'll have eight feet of books, please
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:02.200]   Think of how much how many gin and whiskey balls you can hide behind those books in the bookshelf
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:09.000]   There's usually an air gap display with your audible library. Look at this. We can do any color any subject
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.200]   Any age any size starting at 499
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.080]   This is not fake
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.320]   Job of being a novelist just got even more
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:21.480]   It comes in points. Can I have a bunch of blue books
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:29.800]   This is depressing if you've ever written a book as I have this is where your book ends up and that's the sad thing
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.200]   Sold by the foot
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:37.560]   That's best way to insult someone at the apple stores to walk in and be really excited about buying a blue
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.760]   iPhone 5c when they ask you why they say oh well
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:46.200]   I've been an android user all along, but you know blue really really doesn't play with any of my suits
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.880]   Black and white don't play with my suits. I just this is nice
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:56.920]   Uh, this is a seven and a half to nine and a half inches very good new condition 11 to 16 books per foot
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.680]   You have to order six feet. They're seven dollars a foot. So uh, I could order well. That's pretty good
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.280]   I could order 10 feet
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.600]   For 70 bucks of paperbacks. Do they make sure there's no daniel steel in there
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.800]   Absolutely
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.320]   Absolutely, you can do it. You can have best sellers not as sellers
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.360]   You can have vintage plantsy none of the tom clancy with co-author books
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.880]   There's a lot of check
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.040]   Yeah
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:31.560]   Audible.com/macbreak they should do a deal with books by the foot somehow, you know
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.880]   Like you get a free foot for every five books you read
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.240]   Continuing on we have uh boy
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:42.120]   This has been a saga the vp or senior vice president of retail for apple
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.040]   Ron johnson
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.480]   I did a very good job went to jc pennies and tanked it
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.720]   Then they brought in a guy from dixon's which was what uh dixon's
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:57.560]   Uh, it was like a budget like a five and dime or something in britain. Yeah, he didn't do so good
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.120]   Don brallet tom yeah, and he's gone right
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:07.800]   Yep, not he didn't last long he got the footnote in the forest all his fired press release
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:12.120]   Which is not an auspicious. That's a very bad thing to be a footnote in the forest
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.360]   Oh, and by the way that guy we hired from dixon's gone to yeah
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.560]   So tell us about this is she is the former ceo of burberry
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:25.240]   Not blackberry leo burberry people are making a lot of mistakes out there
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:31.560]   Oh, you really wouldn't want to hire the former her name is angela arance burberry is the raincoat company
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.680]   Right they have that famous plaid the burberry plaid you see the scarf
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:40.120]   Then you know somebody is really very with it and hoot tartan tartan
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.760]   Apparently this british luxury fashion company burberry is a very good
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:52.760]   Proving ground for future apple executives. It's a big deal though. I mean she made uh, I think somebody said she made 15.9 million pounds
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.160]   Last year as ceo of burberry so apples
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:01.720]   Offering has to be offering her more than 20 million dollars a year for this job unless she just you know felt like it was such a good
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.000]   Opportunity do you really want to sell tartan for the rest of your life leader?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.360]   What a change in the world maybe she'd prefer to live in kupertino than london. I don't know
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:17.720]   Although having been to kupertino. I can't understand that she's a murken. Oh, she's a murken
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.360]   She's murken. Oh, all right
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:26.040]   She's coming home. She was at liz clayborne and donna karen international. She knows retail for sure
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   Um
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   She's admired apple for a long time
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:36.760]   She she according to the new york times transformed burberry from stale and stodgy to sexy and chic
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.240]   And a lot of the coverage is also i wasn't very aware of burberry
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:46.840]   Not not enough not enough of not enough of their coats of wind up in the salvation army so i'm not very familiar
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:51.880]   You're not an aboy band Andy so i love burberry by the way, I have a good
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.320]   Cotes and scarves
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.840]   I'm sure it's lovely
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:01.160]   The most awful awful thing to do to a wonderfully made coat or munchro made garment is to have me wear it and then see what i do
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.920]   That's no good thing
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:09.080]   But reading reading obviously with lots of coverage written about over the past week and all that really crediting her for now
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   again taking a brand that was little makers of like tweedy kind of like middle of the road coats
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:19.880]   And making it into a luxury brand but also leveraging that into a re into
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.360]   Chain of retail stores
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:28.440]   Into online or online merchandising marketing the more you read about what she has done the more you think oh, okay
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.720]   So clearly this was this this was her like
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.800]   Warming up her arm and pot tuck it before being called up to the family part
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.520]   For the post-season play it just it just seems like
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:44.040]   Now called up from the Toledo munhans angela rants batting left
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:49.480]   You know what it tells me that I find is very interesting is that apple is now real
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.560]   I mean look this is the second big fashion executive apple has hired
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.200]   I think and I think they're doing I think they're correct
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.840]   The iPhone the iPad
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.000]   These are fat these are the same kind of market as fashion
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.800]   The interesting thing is she's getting online as well as retail where uh ron johnson and bow both only had retail
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   So they're giving her a much bigger portfolio
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.160]   Of products to oversee and yes, they got the guy from eave sailor on they got the guy making shoes from nike
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.280]   They've gotten her chances are this is not just to have a better spring line at the company store in cooperatino
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.280]   They really do want to pay attention
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.480]   According to uh actually cnn money
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:33.080]   She was the highest paid ceo in the uk made 26.3 million last year
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.000]   So apple's got to be offering her a pretty sweet package probably a lot of stock. I would guess
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:47.400]   I bet that most I bet that most of it really is about the challenge about right uh because if honestly if you pay me 17
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.960]   16 million pounds for one year of work
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.600]   You're gonna get one year of work out of me and then i'm gone
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.320]   Well, you cannot you cannot pay me another pound more to work for another day after that if i've got 17 million
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.560]   That's a good point. You've got plenty of money. Yeah, so so it really had to have been here is a
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.240]   We I can take credit for having done wonderful things of berberry
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.560]   And now here is a chance to continue my work with one of the with with a brand that's even larger and even more important than
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   The one i'm leaving well also interesting uh fortune named her one of the 50 most powerful women in business in 2007 2008 and 2011
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.800]   So and she is now not just an svp at apple, but a member of the executive team
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.040]   Yeah, so and i'll i think that's very interesting. Yeah, I mean there are a couple interesting things about that
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:38.520]   I mean not not for one it does point out the how unusual apple's corporate structure is because
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:45.160]   She is leaving as the top dog at a very important company and becoming a vice president of
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.720]   Right of apple and their there there are exactly there are lesser executives who would say i can't accept a title of vice president
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.680]   That's not important, but also when you go to their to apples pr pays that shows you here is our executive team
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.960]   It's nice to see someone a woman not a dude. Yeah, it's so she's eminently qualified
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.880]   That's that's it's a distraction to say that we need more diversity
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:13.240]   But when the right person for the job makes that gallery of portraits more diverse you can only be happy of that result
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:19.720]   This is also it's like melissa marissa mire taking the head of yahoo. This is also a troubled position. I mean
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:26.120]   Um after ron johnson left not only john brow i forgot about this but jerry mc doogel was also in there
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.480]   They've this is I mean it has been a tough position for apple to fill
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:36.360]   Uh, so that challenge is real that challenges look this is this is very important apples battle bottom line
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.520]   The apple stores are huge and if you include itunes which they have
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.720]   I would guess this is you know you're talking about a significant
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.960]   Portion of apples total revenue one of the biggest retailers in the world. Yeah
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.520]   But it's but it's not like yahoo. I mean they the the retail has been doing extremely well
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.880]   Uh, whether in electrons or bricks bricks and mortar. So it really does it's not
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:06.440]   It really does it maybe that's it wouldn't be irresponsible to think that it really is a case of not everybody can work inside of apple
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.720]   Not everybody can really harmonize within that corporate structure
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.800]   So it's not just the skills that you bring in the and the successes in your track record
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.200]   It's also what personal skills do you have and are they compatible with the way that apple
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:25.640]   It likes to run its business. It also means i'm going to have to very much more carefully read apple's press releases because as eena free to point it out
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.120]   And all threes d last month
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:34.840]   Apple announced that burberry and apple would use iphone five s's to capture the burberry runway show
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.680]   Yeah, that's interesting a month ago. So maybe if we'd read this closely
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.600]   I saw that but I did not make that connection again. I don't pickles attention to brands like that, but there's isn't that interesting
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.480]   but also now
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.600]   Here here's another another thing to ask yourself
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.040]   Do you think that we're going to see her at next week's event or a subsequent event?
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.080]   Are they still going to have tim cook talk about retail or are they gonna?
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.520]   Well, she hasn't started till she hasn't started till spring. Okay, that's a
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.640]   Didn't although I would I would love it if they brought her up on stage. Yeah, we said hey by the way
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.840]   Traditionally, that's what tim cook has done in the first act of
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.920]   Every day they do yeah, but wouldn't that be interesting to simply say great. We've got this high profile person
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.600]   We're gonna we want to make sure that we have a face to our leadership on ron retail and we're gonna work
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:29.080]   Why should she be the why should she be one of only five people in that portrait gallery that gets doesn't have to be miserable
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   For the two weeks leading up to that day. Let her have to rehearse for two weeks too
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.280]   There's also uh an interesting question
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.360]   wascal raises in our chat room if if uh erance has
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.040]   digital
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.760]   As well, what happens? What does that mean for eddy q?
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.520]   Who's been in charge of internet services?
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:54.840]   He's services so it like in terms of everything else eddy q does back end and someone else does a front end like uh craig
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.880]   Federica he does the use everything he does o s tan and ios and eddy q provides all that services behind it
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.280]   So he can he's still gonna do the itunes. He's still gonna do i cloud. It's gonna do all of that stuff
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:13.400]   This is just gonna be like the retail front face of apple online and apple um store fronts apple has one a woman on its board
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   Andrea young
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.520]   But uh that would be another thing to think about maybe put her on the board as well. I don't know
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:28.360]   Um, you know given all the the heat that twitter is getting for not having any women in uh on the board or in upper management
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.320]   I mean it's an interesting challenge because they are so successful the question becomes what do you do next because it's fair
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.640]   If you have someone who's brought them to this level quite often
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.440]   That's the odd the logical end point for that person
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.320]   You need someone else with a different set of skills to take you to whatever the next level is and it's not clear
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.320]   They how could apple retail do better and that's going to be the question she has to answer. Yeah
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:55.400]   Uh, you have an article on i'mor.com about uh by joseph keller saying tim cook explains why he hired
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   The wicked smart angel errands and how she'll help boop and move apple forward see another boston euphemism. I don't know why they're
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.160]   Needling us like this
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.160]   Wicked smart wicket smot
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.920]   Mother our god like a frickin web this one
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:17.240]   Uh that links to nine to five mac that was mark german's uh scooh german's got it as usual kerman's good. Wow
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:22.280]   Yeah, uh, this is the the memo what that he sent out to the tim cook sent out to apple
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:27.560]   Uh employees to explain his decision-making process including wicked smart andy wicked smat
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.680]   I've wanted one person to lead
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.920]   both uh
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.920]   digital and retail
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.960]   Uh for some time says cook because I believe it will better serve our customers, but I had never met anyone
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.920]   whom I felt confident could leave both until
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.680]   I meant
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.040]   Angela
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:50.040]   We met for the first time last january. I knew in that meeting that I wanted her to join apple
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:55.800]   We've gotten to know each other over the past several months and i've left each conversation even more impressed. Wow
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.920]   It's nice to have that kind of confidence from the ceo
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.040]   She shares our values and our focus on innovation. She places the same strong emphasis
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440]   as we do on the customer experience
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.400]   I doubt he wrote this memo for brow it
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.760]   He had some nice things to say about brow. He said is the only guy for the job so in hindsight
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:22.120]   Okay, we've heard this before she cares deeply about people embraces our view that the most important resource in our soul is our people
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.600]   She believed blah blah blah
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.680]   But it's bad, but it's bad, but it's bad, but he bought pop
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:35.480]   Just watch some like what do you think is the like the most anti apple reliably like website or reporter out there
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:42.360]   Because he or she's gonna latch onto that quote and say you know the tim cook confirmed that they only started looking at women after they had
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.560]   Every last male they could possibly try he is the last and best male for the job
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.480]   And now they start looking now we could look at women
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.320]   Uh, it's hard to look in that in that that facetime view of your own
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:58.440]   Twisted image isn't it apple ron johnson told blurmberg tv. She's a terrific choice
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:03.080]   And will be exceptionally well received so she's also got approval from her predecessor
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:09.800]   Interesting though. I really think I think that's the most telling thing is that apple's looking at the fashion world
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:15.560]   To bring in people. I mean really says what's happened in the tech world. It used to be specs speeds and feeds
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:21.160]   We're faster. We're better. We're easier to use with a computer for the rest of us now. It's fashion
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.120]   Yep. Well, I just think it's
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.560]   That's not a negative it just means it's mature
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:34.280]   Well, I understand technology they made understand that part of retail. All right. I I really think it's that when when you look at this
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.960]   This this executive's history you think that if there is if if apple's head hunters are any good at all
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.520]   Man, she would be one of the first people you want to bring in if you can get this person who has
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.560]   Built from from the ground up a business that apple is already thriving in right now
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560]   It's kind of kind of let's introduce her to
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.600]   To people she's gonna be working with and see if it's a good fit
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.960]   I think I I certainly don't think it was a bad thing that it's also a high profile, you know fashionable
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:08.920]   Brand but man if if if if if if the oil industry had someone if they if they sold if they sold like oil spills online
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.840]   And an executive was able to sell it as successfully as she was able to sell coats skirts belts and other things
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.560]   I think that they've get interview as well over the counter diesel
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:24.760]   You mean diesel as the the product brand not the motor motor fuel motor oil and he's world where they have the x
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.960]   On guy you made petroleum lubricant sexy again by person when five exotic colors
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.760]   Apple has got the iphone ship date down to two to three weeks for the five s
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.440]   I think you could still walk in and get a five c right because that's easier to produce not because they're not selling it
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.960]   I think this is important to point out
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.200]   But because it's the five so they know how to make it
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.120]   Yeah, it's even easier to make than the five which right because it's plastic on the back
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.880]   Um, so two to three weeks if you want to get one they're giving a mid-November delivery dates
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.800]   Uh
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.720]   All things d says the five s is outselling the five c two to one. I don't know where they get the info from
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.200]   Um, is that do you think that you feel that that's that's accurate?
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:13.000]   If it wasn't the five s would have been a failed product and if it is the five c is under well
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   I mean, it's it's a damned if you do damn right if you don't but the five s was designed to be sold to a bunch of people on launch day and to be that
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.920]   Big apple, you know mega blockbuster product and the five c is designed to be something sold for the rest of the year
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.320]   So this analysis comes from the consumer intelligence research partners or SERP
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.800]   Um, I have to think that really the number you want to look at is total sales
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.040]   And and what you hope is that it's not a zero sum game
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.480]   But that in fact the five c brings more people to the market and so your total sales are up
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.560]   And it's the five c so far is helping to displace the galaxy s4 is exactly smartphone on
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.680]   So you want to see how it affects not cannibalizing the five c if i've asked it's cannibalizing the s4
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.040]   That's what you want
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.240]   I think I think in some ways this act it is targeting the we don't care market
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.960]   Meaning that we don't care that the five s has a super hot process or we don't care that the camera is better
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960]   We don't care that it has the fingerprint control
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.320]   We came in to spend a certain x amount of dollars for a really cool phone
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.760]   Uh, and if this one has really cool smart sharp colors and this one does not
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.360]   That will be good enough for us to reason why we'll pick this one instead of the other one
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.040]   Have any of you been able to reproduce the blue screen of death on your five s?
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.360]   Yes, really
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.960]   Well, our security writer nick r not managed to do it repeatedly. So I
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:33.000]   The story was if you're using iWork and you're what saving to the cloud or something
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.480]   You can also do it with xcode
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.800]   If you're if you're a developer and you're pushing stuff to xcode, well, that's you know, I don't I wouldn't
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:46.200]   That's a so what because that's not normal users. No humanist using it. No human is doing that
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.920]   But if it's doing it and iWork, that's a big deal
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.640]   And I think it's a little funny that it
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.800]   That's the blue screen of death
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.480]   Especially especially on apps that now they're giving away for free right
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.040]   So how so is there a way that is there a reproducible way I can do this right now?
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.880]   I have to look it up
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.520]   I mean that's a part of the subsystem that you should just never be able to see and I think it just speaks to
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.640]   How tight the deadlines were on ios 7 from where they decided in November to spin around on a dime
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.400]   And to when they shipped it that that code is allowed to seep through to humanity
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:25.320]   All right, so and presumably that'll be fixed at some point. Yeah, we are at 702 the
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.240]   Second patch on the iphone already of ios 7 but and it wouldn't be surprising to have 7.1 launch
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.800]   Maybe with new ipads or something. Yeah, yeah, that'd be a good time to fix that
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.080]   I have I haven't had it. I have had a lot of reboots though
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:44.280]   And I have noticed that ios 7 is still a little bit flaky
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:53.080]   When I maybe because I was copying a lot of data over to my five five s but it was rebooting kind of a lot
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.440]   They want to show off those new color matched reboot screens leo
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   It's been pretty reliable ever since though. I mean, you know, that was that was me trying them. Oh, there we go
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160]   Here's a blue screen of death video
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:15.000]   So uh, he's going into ip into pages. He's launching a document. He's messing with it
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.400]   Okay, and then saving it exiting out
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.040]   To the home screen. Oh blue screen of death. Oh wow that hurts
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.920]   You know what I think I have gotten some of those
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.560]   Just not lately
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.080]   Is it possible they fixed some of that with 702 or is nick is nick still getting it?
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.280]   I think it that I don't believe has been fixed yet. Okay
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.960]   It could be wrong, but I don't believe so paste
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:46.120]   Exit out. He actually used speak. Uh, so you have to go into the general
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.080]   Settings under accessibility turn on
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.760]   Speak it. Uh, okay. Well, I don't have that turned on. Maybe that's why all right
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.240]   Uh, anything else we want to talk about before we take a break and go to our picks of the week
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.440]   Oh newsstand. I thought this was this was from marco
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.080]   Uh, how do you pronounce his last name?
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.720]   Carp and then
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.040]   The final straw for newsstand. He's uh, he makes he does digital magazines for richy
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.680]   Um, and he makes them I think a good point
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.240]   He says apps in newsstand get eight unique behaviors the apps listed in the newsstand section of the app store
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:30.120]   In addition to another section of your choosing once downloaded newsstand publications are inside the newsstand app
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.840]   That could be a pro or con
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.920]   Um newsstand apps represented by a cover instead of an icon
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.000]   You don't have to design a icon your latest edition cover even though it's also small
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.800]   You can barely read it, but that's still you kind of I mean I could tell i'm looking at the new york times versus the new yorker
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.600]   Publishers can update the screenshots of newsstand apps without submitting a new binary. That's nice
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.960]   Newsstand app descriptions are uh, an adam feed so it can be updated without apple's approval new stand apps can once a day
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:05.000]   Perform automatic background downloads of content. That's less important because ios 7 does that now for all apps
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.720]   Uh and in app subscriptions and newsstand apps can include free trial periods
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.560]   Um, but he says there's a
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.600]   Problem basically newsstand because it has its own icon
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:25.880]   Really hides what's in there and he's making recommendation to his clients not if you're a publication
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.600]   And you want to you know
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.240]   Beyond the iphone not to use newsstand
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.200]   but in fact to
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:40.120]   Uh do a standalone app because the one big feature the auto update is now global
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:45.560]   And the fact that newsstand apps are hidden away is he says a big negative you guys agree
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.240]   You still get auto renewed subscriptions with newsstand but that sometimes causes more customer service problems
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.040]   Than not having them and i've heard many people who have newsstand apps say that if they could do it again
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.440]   They would go as an app and that's a sad thing because you can't go back you have to
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.520]   There's mixed replies on that i'm it will it'll have to take someone really trying hard to escape
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.240]   Newsstand once you check in you can't check out
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.880]   I wouldn't be surprised if newsstand, uh, I don't know how i don't believe it's getting a lot of attention
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.960]   Anymore inside apple either so I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that is reinvented
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.440]   Um, I'm just looking and I can't even find where I put new stand on my iphone
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.480]   But I don't use newsstand a lot because on the i- I use it on the ipad
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:33.000]   But there are the publications that have been up to now available on the iphone haven't been I can't figure out where I put it
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.920]   You spotlight search leo. I know i'll have to do that n e w
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.640]   Oh, that's me see this is why I don't do that by the way as my fingers are so big
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:48.200]   I keep typing m instead of n it's like I just painful n e w s
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.400]   I don't have it
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.080]   Is it possible not it doesn't look because it's a folder. Yeah, I don't know if it'll search it's a no
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080]   It's gotta find it come on
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:01.400]   Trying mine new it doesn't find it. Well, that's another big problem
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.120]   No, it doesn't find it
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.360]   It's not an app. It's so I have no idea where it's gone. It's somewhere i have to search through my folders now
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.240]   Where did I put it if someone can guess the exact location of leo's news
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:21.000]   Maybe I put it in food. I don't know. I can't find it anymore books how many app icons in the jar
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.880]   Oh, it's not news, which is where I would think I would oh there it is there it is. I see it
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:31.480]   See that's the other problem. That is a stinky icon. What the hell is that?
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.600]   And then I only have the New York times in here
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.240]   But it's nice because the New York times can auto uh can now I can get alerts from him and stuff like that
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.120]   I don't know. It's a well done iOS 7 app. Oh, I didn't I haven't turned that on. Yeah
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.200]   I like New York times. Yeah, they've updated it for iOS 7 out of some very nice ways
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.400]   But do you think they regret it being part of the uh newsstand app
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.600]   No comment. We'll have to ask arthur oaks salt spook
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.880]   I do have kill bossa fingers. I they're just too big
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.960]   Uh
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.880]   iOS 7 has been jailbroken. iOS 702 has been jailbroken
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   Takes no time doesn't
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.200]   Nope. Nope. Nope. And what do you think of this? We'll wrap up with this
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.560]   uh
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.400]   a rumor now that
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   the iWatch is less a
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:27.320]   smartphone companion like this watch that i'm wearing the galaxy gear watch and more and less maybe even of a health
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.800]   thing and more of a
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.560]   Home automation play that's according to cantorfits jerel's brian white
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.280]   Does that make any sense at all?
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:43.720]   No, not to me absent absent devices that apple will then ship right that will enable home automation
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.800]   Well, maybe the apple tv would be one what if you could control the apple tv from an iWatch
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.600]   But I can do that with my iPhone and that's not a round nation player
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.520]   I think that it'll be as unlike the the galaxy gear as the ipad was from netbooks
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.920]   I really think that the i really think the main goal of it was going to be wearable sensors
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.840]   That can then feed into apps that are running on iOS and mac OS devices
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.800]   As well as announce your presence to any other apple devices that you have in the neighborhood
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.600]   I think that this I think we are going to see something more similar to a nike field band or a fit bit
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.200]   Then something that has a screen that has to be updated
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.880]   You know 30 times a second. Yeah, I have to admit this when I read this
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.840]   I thought this guy must not know what he's talking about because
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.720]   You feel you don't have an ecosystem of home automation devices. It makes no sense to do that
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.880]   His job is to move the stokley or not to inform the reader. Oh, yeah that
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   Oh, yeah that
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.840]   Sorry
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.560]   Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was just gonna say that it would be
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.120]   The whole innovation is another application of how good that kind of a wearable device would be
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.040]   To simply have lights turn on and off and follow me around the house
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.800]   And simply know that okay. He left the bedroom about the 20 minutes ago
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.920]   He is in that he has been inside the living room for the past 15 minutes
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:03.960]   Let's take a chance and just turn off that light on the nightstand because he's probably not gonna be back for another few hours
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:10.680]   I mean iOS is definitely a home automation play because it's you can control a bunch of things in your home and iOS in the car
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.120]   Gives us a hint that apple
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:17.720]   You know it may one day explore putting iOS interfaces in a way that you can project to your fridge or to you know
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.680]   Watch for any of that. No the phone already does it
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.920]   Absolutely and any iOS device including a mythical watch could do that
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:29.000]   So, I mean like the tony star cows is the dream and right takes a while to get there. All right

[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:53.400]   No, because I I had I neglected to I neglected to bring in the pick of the week and i had to leave the the podcast
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.040]   I'm casting chair of destiny and I'm I muted the microphone. Are you wearing your pick of the week now?
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.440]   I'm wearing the pick of a week right now with zoom
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.000]   uh, this is a
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.680]   Optics
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.680]   I'm not using them right now. So i'm gonna have to do some some by casting here. These are
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.240]   Wait a minute underneath those headphones and he has headphones
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:19.400]   Yes, these are the aftershocks sports m2 open headphones. These are wild. I have these as well
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.320]   Yeah, which I hope you can sort of see the way this working right now
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.520]   There there i'm not wearing them incorrectly what they are are they have these transducers that go
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.360]   Uh, they basically fit underneath your ear, but not inside your ear
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:39.320]   Uh, which has the really really nice effect of allowing you to listen to podcast allow you to listen to alerts
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:44.280]   Uh from your phone allowing to even listen to music but still have really a
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.480]   Sound awareness of your environment around you
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.000]   Uh, because this is uh after wearing a google glass
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.920]   Uh for a while. I realized that one of the things I really liked about it was the fact that I can be
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.920]   I can get alerts and get information from my phone
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.320]   While still taking a walk down the street and being able to hear birds around me of course
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.600]   Your traffic around me if someone wants to get my attention
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.760]   They don't have to you know motion for me to yank my earbuds out of my ears
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:20.360]   And also they're likely to be uh more comfortable for people who don't like to have these hard plastic earbuds inside your ears all the time
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.080]   Um, and uh, they only have a couple of limited and they really do work as advertised
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.640]   The sound is surprisingly good given that you don't have something actually stuck inside your ears
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.040]   It is actually good for music as well as uh for audiobooks and and podcasts
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.320]   Although you have to accept a certain, you know lack of base
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.400]   Uh, not not as much base as you would get from like a nice silicone earbud
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:47.080]   Also, it's not going to work in any situation in which you want sound isolation because remember this
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.160]   The whole point of this is to not isolate you from your environment around you
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.120]   So if you are like on if you're if you're uh, if you like to take walks
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.880]   Next to really loud high traffic busy streets
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:06.120]   Uh, the car noises are probably going to overwhelm of the whatever music or whatever sounds you're listening to
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.840]   Also, it's a little bit open, but it's not
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.960]   Uh, it's it's not enclosed so that if this is not going to be something that I would choose to wear
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.400]   If I'm sitting next to someone, uh, you know, uh, 12 inches away on a flight for six hours
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.920]   Because they're probably going to be able to hear some of what you're listening to
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:28.440]   It's not as bad as most people on the subway who are wearing earbuds that they're like loud speaker designs
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.880]   You can hear every syllable that's being spoken there that's being sung there
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.000]   But still it's not silent the way that earbuds can be silent
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:40.360]   But again, if you are if you're often in situations where you would like to be able to listen to a podcast
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.560]   But you still want to have some awareness of the natural sounds that are around you
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.600]   These work very very well. Uh, the models the the sports m2 there are
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.640]   I
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.160]   They're weatherproof
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.440]   Uh, they also have a built-in microphone so that you can use them as a as a phone headset
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.840]   Uh, and they work very very well
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.720]   They're not not too expensive 69 bucks. I think
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.560]   Uh for this model they'll have a bluetooth version that's completely wireless
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.720]   I like them because I sweat 79 79. Yeah, I like it because I sweat when at the gym and it's nice to not get the
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.760]   Uh, I've ruined earbuds by sweating into them
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:21.000]   So this is better bone conduction, you know, uh, Chad just ran over to show me he has a kia sarah smart phone
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.640]   He's reviewing it next week. I'm a for you by that has bone conductance too instead of speakers
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.400]   But that would mean chad you have to press the phone against your head
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.400]   No, no, you get a call you put it you put it right where you normally would with a phone
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.280]   And and it just works like normal. This is this is uh, you know what I like is then those idiots
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.200]   I do do you see this a lot?
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:46.040]   I see this all the time who walked down the street with the phone on speakerphone. Yes holding their phone in front of me
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.320]   Yes, I know it's terrible aunt mods got the worst shingles
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.800]   And then they're going down the street
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.640]   And then you hear the other end because it's on what is wrong with those people
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.280]   They think that I am legend that the last human left on earth
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.600]   Well, at least my favorite is when they they speak to the screen
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.480]   Yeah, the mic is down here. You you can't you can't talk to the phone this way
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:15.720]   It doesn't really work, but I don't understand why they're doing that. Is that some is it a thing?
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.120]   They're crazy leo. No because it's very common. I see it all the time
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.840]   At least at least we've seen like that now that cell phones are digital plans are out there
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.120]   We've we've we've we've lost those like remember those phones. You have those digital walkie-talkie features
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.600]   That's what it is. I push the talk. That's what it is
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.600]   They think they're using a next-tell phone
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.000]   You'd be in a restaurant. It's not just like having to listen to someone else's conversation, but
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.520]   Yeah, that's the worst part that ring. So what did he send then?
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:45.160]   Yeah
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.160]   Well, I think you should just leave them
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.280]   Hello, this is a sixty-four somebody just explained it to me
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.760]   Somebody just explained it to me and you're absolutely right. It started with reality tv
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:03.160]   If you're watching the Kardashians, they have to always do that so that the camera can hear the conversation
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.640]   And that became fashionable
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:12.040]   So blame the apprentice blame meet the Kardashians or whatever the hell it's called project runway project runway
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.160]   I will not blame our project runway
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:22.040]   For anything other than making the world understand that an a-line dress with an empire ways is just a sin against god
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.760]   I think that's it. They watch too much reality television
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:30.840]   They think that's how you use a phone not understanding the reason kim kardashian does it is so the cameras can pick up the audio
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.560]   Or maybe they're just stupid. I don't know why you're maybe both
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.200]   the nicest fellow
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.520]   Does tim and gun do that when he used his tim gun save this week?
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.680]   Yes, I teared up a little bit because there was a very very caring and touching moment
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.960]   Renee richy. I'm warne.com your pick of the week my friend
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:58.200]   my pick of the week is the newly updated for iOS 7 launch center pro it is a
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.800]   Large center apple does not allow intense or contracts like you have on android or windows phone
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.600]   So you can't just exchange information between apps
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.200]   Nor do they let you reset the default apps like you can do on android
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.560]   So this is by david barnard and a year or so ago
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.280]   He figured out that you could use these url schemes these little links that apple does let you send
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.640]   To actually not only open apps but perform actions
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.640]   So for example instead of hitting the safari button and then typing in a web address
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:32.200]   You can have a link that opens up safari and goes to the same web page or opens up the phone and places a call to your mom or your wife or
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.320]   your husband or whomever to text message or
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.040]   And this whole scheme evolved called your
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:44.680]   Ex callbacks and url scheme so you can actually it's nowhere near as good as a system level service
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.800]   But it lets you do far more than you could do with your iphone
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.840]   Alone and by itself so with this with this for example, you can launch actions
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:58.040]   You can set up any of a dozen of different things and the app makes it really easy to add new actions
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.600]   And if you put it on your dock you're then only two
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:06.680]   you know taps away from a wide range of common tasks adding something to omni focus or
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.320]   We made the imore app work with it
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.480]   So you can open launch center pro and hit the imore app icon and go to different places
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.640]   Uh, and it's really provides a service it fills up a gap in apples
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.080]   Operacism that they're so far, you know, not ready to do
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:27.480]   Um, it's it just works. It's one of those great services and he's continuously updating it and putting in
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:33.320]   Um new url's and new schemes and when other apps come out they can add launch center pro support
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:40.280]   So again, not as great as a built-in service like contracts are intense but way better than what you get on ios without it
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.640]   awesome
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.120]   What's the name again launch center pro launch shunter pro how much?
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.720]   um
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.600]   499 or 99 that's why yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.080]   And people who complain about apps still costing money again
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.720]   That's the price of us of a nice coffee beverage that you will enjoy for three minutes and this app you get to use
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.080]   Day in day out for a year that is one of the stories we didn't cover
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.840]   Uh, we talked a little bit about an ipad today, but the death the end of the paid app
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.360]   Uh, which i bemoan because i think you ought to pay for apps and i really hate this freemium model
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.040]   It sounds like apples data does not back up those assertions. Oh good
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:19.720]   Yeah, well i got a free app that is free will always be free, but it's an interesting business model
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:25.800]   It's actually i think sera turned me on to this when uh, i was traveling i knew i needed to learn a little brush up my Italian
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.320]   I downloaded duo lingo do you guys know about duo lingo?
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.880]   Fantastic isn't it amazing
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:37.000]   So, uh, it's free and the business model is interesting created by a karnigie melon professor
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:43.160]   Uh, you can learn a variety of languages absolutely free and they have a great learning model. It's a game. It's kind of gamified
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.000]   So i'm i'm learning spanish now because uh, so
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.240]   Select the apple. Obviously there's a picture of an apple so you you pick it. Let me just
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.040]   So you can hear this
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.840]   It's got a nice little voice i check you got a little
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.120]   Oh, bing bing bing
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:02.680]   You are correct and then you can move on if you start putting together sentences and so forth
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:06.280]   You're learning verb conjugation here in a painless way
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:11.480]   I just think it's a really nice app, but here's the interesting thing the way they're paying for this app was created
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.880]   Uh by as i said a karnigie melon professor the guy who created recapture
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.520]   Uh, you crowdsource
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.040]   It's using duo lingo and duo lingo users to crowdsource
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.600]   translations
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.160]   And the paying customers who pay for these translations
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.040]   Pay for the language lessons
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.160]   Um right now spanish french german
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.240]   Portuguese
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.480]   Brazilian style and italian
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:42.600]   As well for english speakers as well as english for spanish french parchigies and italian speakers
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.440]   Um, it's really a clever idea read the wiki pd article to understand why it's a profitable
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.240]   To give away a free app like this
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.240]   And uh, and i've found it really fun
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.040]   Just to play a little bit each day
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.800]   And uh and you learn and uh, i mean it's you know, it's you're not going to be
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:06.120]   Fluent or maybe you are i'ma gotten far enough but you're certainly going to get enough to to be able to talk
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.600]   Duo lingo you like it rene
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:14.360]   My seven-year-old godson is using it to learn italian because his paternal grandparents both speak italian
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.440]   And they can say very little to each other on the phone
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   And he's been using this just for a couple months and he's already saying you know sentences and things and to me it's fun
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   It's accessible to children of that age and that being spectacular
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.600]   Uh, it's just really fun. And by the way buzzfeed is using it. They're paying them
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:33.560]   For translations of the buzzfeed articles
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.080]   It's really clever. They also i think they're on the web and on other platforms, but they have a iphone and uh
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.920]   Uh, ipad version duolingo.com
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.400]   See there's free but an interesting business model that makes free really not
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.040]   I mean it's free to you, but they make money too, which is an optimistic kind of free. Yeah, i like it
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.520]   Really like it
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   Rene richies at imore.com
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.040]   You guys got to come back in a week. I don't know how we're going to do mac break weekly
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:04.200]   I guess we'll do as we usually do we'll do live coverage starting at 930 of the event
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.720]   Presuming the event starts at 10 which i'm sure will does it say on the invite

[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.240]   I think last year's october event was massive. They refreshed every product except the iphone
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.040]   I don't know if we're going to see something like that, but it's going to be exciting and as you could tell from our conversation
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.560]   Could be some surprises. Mm-hmm
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:44.360]   Andy and rene i hope you'll be here for that if not certainly for mac break weekly immediately after Andy and i co the chicago sun
