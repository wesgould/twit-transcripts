[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Hello.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Wearing Hawaiian today.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I feel like I'm a bit of a turncoat though.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Why is that?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I just want to say for those of you watching that I just got this shirt.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It was given to Leo.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's not given to you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's not given to you.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's not given to you.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It's lended to you.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's lended to me.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's lended to me.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I'm a Stieler fan.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Oh, it's a dental culture.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's a dental culture.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I just want to say that Leo got the fishy shirt and I got the Titan shirt.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I can get you to the other shirts.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   We have other shirts.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But I'm a little embarrassed about the whole Titans thing.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   But I don't have anything against Titans.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'm just, you know, it's, Stieler's just kind of like a religion.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Stielers.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So I just want people to know.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   How do you say Stielers in Pittsburgh on Stullers?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Stullers.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.400]   In a sentence it's used in the hey, you guys going down there, you know, so we're going
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.700]   to go see the Stullers and you know, maybe you'll see in the stands, maybe we'll up
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.800]   there to see Marlameu and then you'll say Marlameu.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.480]   That's, that's usually how it plays for the Pittsburgh penguins.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.440]   Greatest hockey player after Wayne Gretzky.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.240]   No, no bigger than Wayne.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.720]   I don't know if he had been in the bucket hall.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.000]   Most people say if he had stayed healthy, he would have broken every record in the NHL.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That's what they say about me.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.200]   If I'd stayed healthy, I might have had a career.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.360]   The guy who's prompted all of this is Mr. Tommy Bahama himself, Scott Born, who we have just
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.200]   learned owns 313 Tommy Bahama shirts.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Well, 312.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.720]   I gave him on subscription, you know.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.640]   Yeah, you're going to automatically understand.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   And he's got three closets specially built to house the collection.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.600]   Well, you know, I got to have something to do with my spare time.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.440]   I love it.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.720]   So here in his, by the way, that is a lovely shirt featuring Pino Coladas, a Tommy Bahama
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.360]   original right there with the wooden buttons with wooden buttons.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   And tell that there's a hammer.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.400]   And as our, as Bush Williams says in our friend feed room, it's all about the wooden buttons.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Is it?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   Bubba.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   I like that guy.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.560]   And these buttons are not wooden.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.000]   His, his noggin might be, but his buttons aren't.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   What are you wearing?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.720]   Andy and Akko from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.920]   I was trying, I was trying to find out exactly how to find out who shirt this is without actually
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   taking off a wearing shirtless.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.560]   You have to do that graceful thing where you pull the shirt up over your head.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   Exactly.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.960]   As a matter of fact, to be fair, I really should at some point during a quiet part of the show
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   to sort of slide off and then check the shirt because it was actually something a Mac brick
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   weekly listener who makes these shirts was very pleased to put one of my hands.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.240]   It's actually one of the hands and most colorful shirts I have.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.760]   Oh, well, you and you got sent a Hawaiian shirt and not me.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.480]   I just, I've just lived, I've lived the freelancer's dream.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.920]   I can dress myself now completely from head to toe shoes, socks, pants, all no underwear,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.800]   but you know, shirt and everything strictly from things that people have given me because
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.360]   they're readers or PR people.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Isn't that nice?
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360]   Very nice.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   Isn't that nice?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.480]   Well, because they also figure that, you know, you have such impeccable Aloha shirt fashion
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.960]   sense, Scott, that he does not want to take the risk of showing his own endurance.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520]   You know, he knew that he could school me.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.800]   I need, I need, but what if he converted me?
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.640]   Would that not be a coup for his company?
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.520]   That would be a hell of a coup for his company, which is why I'm going to make sure that I
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   again, I will do this off camera, of course, but I shall partially disrupt.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.560]   I am sure that I am wearing a shirt underneath this, of course, also a free shirt that I
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   got from.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.520]   Hey, and I am wearing, I am wearing one.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.720]   Get them to send like meat bread vegetable.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   You're set.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   Dude staples.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.560]   Well, you know, exchange shirts for, I exchange shirts for food.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   I'm not proud.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   I'll admit it.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.760]   Wait, did you pay for that shirt?
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.840]   No, tech TV paid for this shirt.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   I see.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.920]   So free shirt, free shirt, free shirt.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   Oh, wait.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   And then.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.720]   And then Scott bought his paid shirt, paid shirt.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.040]   I paid for my shirt and had to build a closet.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.760]   These are, I believe you're pulling the, you'll, you'll, you'll going to be pulling the ethical
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.360]   cart for all four of us.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   This is exactly right.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   That's right.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.280]   I'm going to pretend I'm Andy Anaco ethical journalist today.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.520]   I paid for my shirt.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.960]   Tommy Bahama can't pay me off.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   No.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.520]   I am, I am wearing Gruper and Mahi Mahi today.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.560]   By the way, it is appropriate for us to celebrate Hava.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.680]   Because Roz Savage set off last yesterday.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.440]   This is, this is, this thing is so freaking amazing that she can do this.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.160]   I just, I just do not understand where the will within that woman comes from.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   I do.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   I've dealt with her.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   She is a, she is a force of nature.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   Wow.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.000]   You don't, you know, I mean, just Roz gets what Roz, and she's very sweet.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   She's the iron fist in the velvet glove, but Roz gets what Roz wants.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   This is what you have to do.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   If you're going to be this, Rose solo.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.300]   And when I say solo, this is without chase craft, support craft of any kind solo, first
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.800]   across the Atlantic, then from Hawaii.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   It's got a big boat.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.640]   It looked like, looked like a big seal and the big shark would be excited about it.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.200]   It's nice and silver and it flashes through the water.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.680]   She is a little worried about large fish, actually sharks and stuff.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   Does she see them?
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   Yeah, occasionally.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.040]   She didn't see a lot from Hawaii, San Francisco to Hawaii, but she may see more from now.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   She's going from Hawaii to Tuvola.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.680]   She's going to cross the equator.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.400]   That's actually the big concern because they're cross currents on the equator.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.000]   And it's very difficult to get across the equator by hand.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   She's rowing.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   She's rowing across the equator.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   She's rowing.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.160]   We talk to her every Thursday at 430.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.120]   How long is it going to be at sea?
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   She estimates about a hundred days.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.240]   Took her a hundred days to get for San Francisco to Hawaii.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   I did.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.040]   You know what really is scary is that San Francisco to Hawaii, her water maker broke, her backup
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.200]   water maker broke.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.320]   She was drinking water out of, she had fortunately thought to put fresh water in his ballast.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.960]   And she was drinking her ballast.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.880]   And she met up with a bunch of guys who were also crossing to Hawaii.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.160]   They were all rowing together.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.120]   No, they were in a motorboat called the junk boat.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.480]   It was built entirely out of junk, including an old airplane fuselage and a bunch of plastic
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   bottles.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.280]   She raised awareness of the Pacific garbage patch.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   And they had water makers despair and she had food despair.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   They were running out of food.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   It's not easy.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   Anyway, she's doing it again.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.640]   Yes, she's going to go to a tuba.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   We'll cover it.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.920]   We'll have live conversations with her via a sat phone and very crazy.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.600]   How does she sleep?
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.920]   Quite well I mentioned after rowing for 14 hours.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   But see, I wouldn't be able to sleep with her for a big fish.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   She's got a compartment.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.600]   She's got a compartment, a hatch, a watertight compartment.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.480]   I watched a 14 hour Star Wars marathon over the weekend and that put me right.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   Did you really?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.760]   Yeah, I could watch a 14 hours worth of science fiction in Star Wars movies.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.440]   That's like the most ambitious thing I've done in my life compared to her.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.600]   See, I've decided now I'm a star.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.920]   Alex is going to throw something at me.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.480]   I'm a Star Trek fan.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.040]   We enjoyed Star Trek.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.640]   I think I watch Star Trek more often than I enjoy Star Trek a lot, especially the new
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   movie.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.120]   But I have always been a big Star Trek fan.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.880]   Yeah, I think I'm more of a star, more of a Trek-y than I am.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   What do you call it?
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   Star Wars fan.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Star Wars fan.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   Star Wars.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Jar Jar Jar.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.880]   He's not only called them either a Jawa or a Stormtrooper.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.880]   Hold the list.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.640]   Oh, we started this.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.840]   Just scared to death.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   I heard the word.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   No, no, no.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   I was doing a Jawa.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   Okay.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.440]   Scott actually had his head in his hands.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.880]   We're going to have another conversation.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.480]   Is there a way to track how many people simultaneously tune out of the show at once?
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   Not anymore.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.160]   We used to when we were on Stick Am, we'd have this number on the Stick Am These.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.600]   And now actually we have an API though.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.680]   What we really want to do is put a widget on the feed that shows a graph.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.320]   So it'd be like those turn people meters that they do in political campaigns and you'll
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.040]   actually see it start to plummet.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   That's good.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   It's good.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   It's good.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   It's out the riff-raff.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.040]   That's what we want.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   Advertisers, people of good sense taste and breeding and money.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.120]   It's these losers who can't appreciate star wars from our folks that have no discretionary
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   income.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.320]   They're here because what are they doing?
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.480]   They're waiting for a call from a guy who's thinking to pick up a package at this place.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.680]   That's why those other people-
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   We don't want them.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.120]   No casual listeners.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.720]   You must be fully engaged and sitting on an inflatable ball if you want to really be part
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.440]   of the show.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.640]   So story number one.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   I don't know if this is a big story or not.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.680]   North Carolina is providing special tax flavors for Apple because they're going to spend $1
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:45.200]   billion, not $1 million, $1 billion and potentially hire hundreds of North Carolinians for a server
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   farm.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.920]   But why is Apple building a server farm in North Carolina?
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.280]   That might be the question I would ask.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.760]   Well, I mean, a lot of these companies are building server farms all over the place.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.560]   What is Apple in the server farm?
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   Dot Mac.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.120]   That's one thing.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.000]   The iTunes store has to be served up.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.240]   There's a lot of heavy bandwidth stuff that they're already doing.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.840]   It could be more video or something new, but it really could just be-
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   That's just it.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.560]   They have enough stuff that they have to deal with that building one huge server farm wouldn't
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.440]   necessarily be out of the ordinary.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.280]   Well in that case, no big deal.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.680]   Other than it's a lot, it's really good for North Carolina.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   It's good for North Carolina.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.560]   There's a lot of excerpts going in there.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   Are there anything Apple uses?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   Exserves are probably the use come out of a Windows machines.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   I hear they get a good deal on the excerpts.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.000]   I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Other stories.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.280]   Well, I want to talk about the iPhone.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   Oh, all right.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.960]   You said you have a scooplet for us.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.600]   Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.800]   I heard from a very reliable source something that kind of blew my mind.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.240]   Now back in the day a couple of years ago when I was covering the iPhone and being mercilessly
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.320]   beaten up by Merlin Mann for doing it, I would occasionally mention a source.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.520]   The sources I had, they were always best back then were AT&T, not at Apple.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.680]   The people at Apple are so scared of losing their jobs, they know not to talk.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.560]   But the people at AT&T were so giddy with excitement that they were calling me unsolicited and
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.840]   giving me info.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   Much of it turned out to be true.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:29.760]   I had a conversation yesterday on Memorial Day with an extremely high up Verizon employee
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.720]   who told me flat out they are getting an iPhone.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.880]   And the only real question, I mean, that's not surprising, but how soon is the question?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   Well, this is the interesting part.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.240]   He said, June, what?
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.160]   He said, as soon as June, it'll be announced.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.800]   This June, this June, June, June, eight.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.320]   Now, he said announced.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.520]   Yeah, well, he was announced.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.920]   I think this WWDC may end up being a big, big keynote.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.120]   It'll obviously be a different kind of iPhone because it can't have a sim chip in it.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.080]   It's got to be CDMA.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.320]   But this is an easy thing to do.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.240]   A lot of companies make both GSM and CDMA phones.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   Right.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   But it would be a new phone.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.360]   CDMA gets better reception.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.400]   And Verizon is a much faster network than Tmo or AT&T.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.320]   To EVDO is, I know the GSM is supposed, I mean, it's the three G is supposed to be as
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.600]   fast as the EVDO and as someone who has an EVDO modem, it's not even close.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.120]   Well, Scott just bought a MIFI.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.280]   We've got now three people.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   Four.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   No, all of us are using Verizon EVDO.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   Yep.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.840]   And it's very fast.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.520]   I just thought that was what was interesting about this was the way I came by the information.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.840]   It was very similar to my experience with dealing with the AT&T people.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   It could, of course, be bogus.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.520]   But I really believe in my heart that this guy believes that they're getting an iPhone.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   And I then just confirmed it with a second source, not nearly as high up in the company
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.720]   who said, yes, they had been told by marketing people to prepare for it.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.440]   Now, this brings about a couple of interesting things.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.080]   The first one is a chuckle because I remember when the iPhone was announced, Verizon, people
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   were dissing it as, "Ah, you don't need an iPhone."
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.800]   Yeah, we got everything that they got.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.960]   You know, now all of a sudden they're happy about it.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.600]   That was my first thought.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.160]   And the second thought is that if this happens, if you listen to the statements, cook made
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.120]   last week or a few weeks ago about the iPhone, he said, "We're going to stick with AT&T."
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.760]   He didn't say that in such a way that meant exclusively.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.000]   We're going to stick with them.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.960]   So, what if they've got AT&T and Verizon?
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.400]   Well, look how well the phone is done with just AT&T.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.960]   You put them with Verizon and AT&T.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   It's dominant.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   I do have to say, if they get a Verizon phone, I'm so, so, so gone from AT&T.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   I think I probably will.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   I'll find out what it takes to get rid of it.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   I hate my AT&T research.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.160]   Which is probably why AT&T will fight this tooth and nails.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   Because what are they going to offer?
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   You know, it could be.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.520]   I have to say, it could also be a negotiation strategy on Apple's part to get a better deal
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   at AT&T.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   I mean, that's my second thought.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.960]   Well, I think, you know, the rumor was that the Apple's first choice in the first place
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   was Verizon.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.360]   So, in some ways, AT&T has given Apple the leverage to have another conversation with
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   Verizon.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.400]   But the Verizon network is so much more solid than the AT&T network.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.800]   I mean, it's not even a...
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.560]   And Andy and I are going to take a bullet for all you guys because we're both getting
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   preys, right, Andy?
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   He looks like it.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   Are you getting one from Sprint?
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.720]   I'm getting one from Palm.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.960]   Oh, and that's maybe that was my mistake.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   I went to Sprint.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   I should contact Palm.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.560]   That's a good idea because I don't...
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, I'm willing to wait in line, but it's a Saturday and that's...
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I have to do a radio show.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   Although, I do have a Sprint EVDO modem on the...
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.200]   My friend has one plan in which I swap two slices of pizza at our local pizza place for
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.680]   a week long alone from time to time.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   And their speeds are very fast, very reliable, even again on an Amtrak train on the Northeast
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   Corridor.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.800]   I've never had any problems getting at least three bars from the source of destination.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.720]   So, Sprint is also a hell of a carrier.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   I agree.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.920]   I mean, I think they don't have the coverage that Verizon has, though.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.480]   Verizon does seem to be the coverage king.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.540]   I'm not sure if they deliver the most reliable speed in every place they cover.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.760]   But remember that when you're doing mobile broadband, all you care about is getting
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   bars.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   All you care about is getting connectivity.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   Speed is a great bonus, but really all you care about is to make sure that you can...
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.440]   If you're paying 60 bucks a month, you will never be in a place in the United States where
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   you cannot get coverage.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.280]   Although, when I get both the pre-end, if I still have my loan or my fi, I'm going to
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.720]   make a little bit of trip up to Bellows Falls, Vermont.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:40.860]   Vermont is like the land that time forgot in terms of GPS, in terms of cell phones.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.060]   They don't even have iPhones up there because there's no AT&T.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.540]   Your iPhone spontaneously gets one of those little horn microphones and a crank on the
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540]   side of it.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.540]   That's the only answer to Verizon.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.540]   Hello, Sparky, this is Raynard.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   Central.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.540]   Give me Sparky.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.780]   No, it's just one of these things.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.540]   Elle Maloo, could you hang up the phone?
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.540]   Party line.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.540]   Party line.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.240]   Seriously, if Verizon gets better coverage in Vermont than most of the other phones and
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.120]   data plans I've tried, I think that'll be a slam dunk for Verizon.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.400]   You will hear me talking about this everywhere.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.280]   I'm told that Vermont now does have the iPhone, so there's a big victory for the...
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Not the big state.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.040]   Three-pronged power outlets?
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.720]   No, sorry.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   No grounding.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.960]   There's no grounding anywhere in Vermont.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   You know, there...
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.920]   Now we're going to get letters from Vermont dung begins.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   What's the syrup down?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.360]   A little very hollis down this time.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.380]   Is Vermont the Nutmeg State?
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.580]   By the way, I don't know.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.740]   What is the Nutmeg State?
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.780]   I didn't know there was a Nutmeg State.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.780]   Nutmeg State is Connecticut.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.780]   Connecticut's a Nutmeg State.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.540]   I got to find out before we get those emails.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.420]   I got to find out what Vermont is.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   I love Vermont.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   I love Vermont.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.420]   Went in Vermont.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.420]   Bellows Falls.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.220]   You got the Connecticut River.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.020]   You got the Miss Bellows Falls diner.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.100]   Isn't that where Zuzu's petals were?
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   You know.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   Ballotge Falls.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.020]   If I'm on.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.500]   Let's talk about...
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   Okay.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.480]   I guess iPhone, we could continue to talk about that a little bit because there are a number
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.640]   of iPhone rumors floating about.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.300]   Let me just clarify with Scott though.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.860]   Are you Verizon contacts saying that they are really close to getting it?
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.000]   Are they really certain they're going to be getting it?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.600]   Well, once again, he was a little bit cryptic, but he did say there was going to be an announcement
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.940]   that Verizon was getting their own.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   He said these words.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.620]   I'm trying to get it exact.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.680]   Their own iPhone and the announcement was coming in June.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   That's what he said.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.280]   And by the way, Vermont is the Green Mountain State and home of Cabot Cheddar, which is the
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.900]   best cheddar in a lot of maple syrup.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.560]   So Scott, that's interesting because that couldn't indicate that.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.640]   If Apple tried to do an iPhone Nano, this is a way to sort of wean the contract away
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.560]   from AT&T to simply say that, tell you what, the really cheap one, the one that's going
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.880]   to be going to charge $149 for is going to be Verizon.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.920]   So if that's one possibility, you think?
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   Absolutely.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.200]   There'll be a way to get around the contract.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.080]   There's a lot of options there.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.760]   And of course, I'm hoping that from a purely selfish point of view that it's the full fledged
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.240]   iPhone so I can dump my AT&T iPhone, but I will be dumping my AT&T iPhone for different
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   reasons.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.520]   Alex, I get fine coverage.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   My problem is they're billing practices are just horrible in my opinion.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.120]   So I'm looking forward to getting around those, but I have to have all these different cell
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.600]   phones, the only reason I have the AT&T is so that I can enjoy my iPhone.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.440]   I'll dump that, but I've got Verizon everywhere else.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.120]   Verizon even works at my cabin, which is 12 miles from the gate to Mount Rainier, which
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   is about as wilderness as you can get.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.200]   Is there going to be an iPod or iPhone Nano?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   That is one of the rumors.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think it's reasonable to assume it's coming.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.120]   In order to get the price point down to the place where they've already established that
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.520]   they can get the huge share of the smartphone market at the high price.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.280]   Why not just own that and why worry about the cheesy stuff?
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.880]   Well, the only reason I think they might go down so low is just because there's so much
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.960]   profit if they can get a similar agreement to what they had with AT&T where they're getting
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   some comeback money on the monthly bill.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.360]   I don't see how you can walk away from that, Leo, because your costs are a good soul that
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.080]   that point are almost zero.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   Right.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.480]   Also, at some point, you run out of people to sell phones to.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.800]   At some point, everybody who is capable of spending $200 to $300 on a smartphone has already
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.040]   made their choice.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.520]   The people who have already made their choices of Blackberries and are not going to be moving
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.240]   away have made their choices.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.160]   You have to start going after the people who will not spend $200 to $300 for a phone.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.320]   I don't think it's much of a case of getting an iPhone Nano as much as figuring out a way
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.800]   to sell something that it can reasonably and rationally be called an iPhone for $99.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   Maybe.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.920]   I think that's the netbook strategy.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.720]   I don't see Apple going down that road.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   They did the same thing with the iPods.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   First, you had iPods.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.880]   Yeah, but the iPod functionality is very simple.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.040]   The key to the iPhone is the functionality is running the applications at reasonable speed,
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.120]   is reasonable performance.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.760]   I think that this is a computer.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.880]   This is not an iPod.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.320]   So I'm going to be the dissenting voice on this, not because I have any intelligence.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.120]   I have no intelligence.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.200]   Because it just doesn't seem to me to fit Apple's model.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   No, I think it's more likely to see the media pad than it is to see an Nano.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I don't think we're going to see any of it.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   In other words, go up, not down.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   Yeah, I think they'll go up before they go down.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.600]   I think it's a strong argument as well, Leo.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.240]   Your point of view is also a strong argument.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.360]   I mean, I'm one that believes Apple often makes the right decision when they stay at
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   the high end.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.480]   I just think that there's a lot of difference between making a price cut in a cell phone
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.720]   where it's just not as big a drop as it would be dropping a $1,200 MacBook to a $200
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:55.600]   netbook would be a huge drop dropping a $2.99 phone to $1.59 is far a leap.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.320]   And I also think that Andy hit it on the head.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.840]   You're going to run out of people eventually who can pay that amount.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.040]   Well, if you don't need, if you broaden it to Verizon, if you broaden it to more carriers,
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.120]   you automatically, you don't run out of people till you get on all the carriers.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   That's true.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.960]   I think if you can broaden it to Verizon, then then you've got to think about it.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.800]   But I do wonder what sort of entanglements they have with AT&T when it comes to the contract
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.120]   on the original iPhone and their five-year deal and whether or not they can get out of
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.640]   that without doing something.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.920]   The reason I, one of the reasons I think that the smaller iPhone or the somehow, you
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.800]   know, minimalized iPhone would be relevant would be that that might be a way to get around
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.920]   the contract because they could say it's a whole new product.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   I think if you could do a performance-wise, a credible product and then at a lower price,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.800]   okay, but what are you going to give up?
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.480]   You can't put a slower processor in.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.280]   You can't.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.280]   You can.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.880]   I mean, imagine already we're sort of speculating and hoping for sort of a superset of the iPhone
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.960]   in the form of a tablet with everything bigger, bigger processors, more storage, bigger screen,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   all that other cool stuff and a new class of software that's designed to run it.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.880]   What if at the same time they said, oh, and by the way, we also want to help you
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.480]   make software not just for $700 devices, but for $99 devices.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.720]   And now here is the new iPhone slim.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.120]   And here's the new screen size has a lower processing footprint, lower battery life to
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.840]   a rather a smaller battery to take advantage of that sort of stuff.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.320]   You could have a whole new class of widget-like software that's designed to run it.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.080]   I mean, I'd actually be pretty interested in it.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.280]   If all they did was simply say that, oh, by the way, it works with dashboard widgets
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.560]   or anyway, if you've written a widget, it'll take you about 20 minutes to convert it so
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   that it will work on the new iPhone slim.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.120]   And you could do the visual voicemail and all the features that AT&T is giving them presumably,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   right?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.480]   Can we not call it the slim though?
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.360]   I mean, you know, slim sounds like a cowboy.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.640]   Slim is just, you know, those of us who are, who are, who are, who are, who are, who are
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.120]   only challenged, we may not appreciate the name slim.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.800]   So you listen here, slim.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   Slim.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.280]   You know, when I was in, when I was in the army, I was called tiny.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   Oh gosh.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.800]   Yeah, that's kind of an insult.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   Unless you were tiny.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.880]   These next gen iPhone specs that have been rumored out.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.960]   Well, we talked last week.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]   Okay.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960]   What is it?
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   What is the latest?
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.280]   Latest is the, well, this is, this is on wired.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.680]   And so it's 32 and 16, 199, two, nine.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.880]   Is that the same ones that 3.2 camera?
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.360]   Remember last week the one, the one, yeah, the one thing that we thought was not credible
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.520]   was FM transmitter.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.720]   That kind of blew the all the whole rumor out of the water.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.240]   I think it could be a typo where it should be receiver.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.440]   FM receiver would be possible.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Even that's dumb.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.800]   Who wants an FM radio in her phone?
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.160]   That's, that's the part I really don't get.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   I really want a transmitter or receiver.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.120]   Again, remember that it has a transmitter and FM, FM signal can be used for a lot more
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.680]   than just receiving actual FM, like, you know, stereo radio.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.240]   It's also for communicating with, with nearby devices.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.520]   Although I think, I think that for me, the torpedo for this isn't that there's the torpedo
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.040]   for this isn't FM radio, you know, again, tuning in 89.9 the, the, the smooth jazz FM
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   on top, Massachusetts.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   Hey, I.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.440]   I hung out with Earl Clue last night.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.640]   Okay, talk about smooth jazz.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.120]   Mike, Mike, my problem with it is that there are already so many radios inside that device
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.120]   as it is.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   Right.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.920]   It's going to be such an engineering problem to get another one in there that doesn't interfere
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   with everything else.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.800]   The only thing, the only reason that you'd have an FM transmitter is if you had a very,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.280]   very, you know, low powered FM transmitter, that's how all of these interfaces work that,
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.840]   that allow you to hook to a car stereo.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.800]   So if you just want to, if you want to, and to me, I don't think it works very well.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.840]   You know, I think that it's too many, too many people like Griffin making those.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.280]   What about Brian in the chat room says, what about traffic?
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.200]   Traffic info to add to your GPS.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.120]   See that, that, that also works again, communications to exercise gear exercise equipment.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   That also works.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.840]   Again, if we're talking, talking about audio transmission from the iPhone to someplace
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.560]   else or from, but you could do all those things with Bluetooth.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   That's not it.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.000]   Yeah, but Bluetooth is a hassle.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.800]   You can't simply walk up to any random treadmill inside your right.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   You got a pair of, yeah.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.320]   You have to pair it and set it up.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   And then you call the guy over who looks better than you.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.840]   And he has to walk, not only is he.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   Nope.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.400]   Also understands the technology, but then you Ross FM is just, Oh, Andy has a girlfriend,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.920]   which I really am.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.400]   I think that I do have a girlfriend.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   Oh, good.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.640]   I'm a better looking guy.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.240]   And, and he has a, I'm sorry.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   So I don't know.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.080]   No, no, so sorry, Andy.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.520]   So I could see that.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.000]   I think that, you know, as somebody uses a polar watch, which automatically bonds to
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   whatever exercise equipment you're using, I could see the real value of that.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.920]   I'd love, you know, I use an eye fitness application.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.520]   It's called life in this that I would love if it automatically knew how many miles I'd
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.800]   were just run on the treadmill or how many, you know, I mean, that would be cool.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.920]   So maybe that would be an accessory FM.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   I could see it.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   Yeah, but you hit it on the head.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.000]   You know, how many radios can you pack into this thing before you start setting up?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.360]   There's fines with all of these radios, the Nokia and 95 as well.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.560]   I know a bunch of the Nokia's are about to come out with FM radios.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   And I know you can do it.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.360]   I'm just saying at what point does it become kind of crazy?
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   Right.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.400]   There's a certain level of backwards compatibility that Apple's not known for.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   But this rumor I should point out says FM transmitter, which is the least interesting
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.280]   solution all around.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.080]   So it just doesn't seem that credible to me.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   So that rumor, I think we, you know, what else do we, let's not, let's not focus on
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   rumors.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.560]   Let's focus on using our noggins to think about what Apple might want to announce on
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   a, we do this.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.960]   So I think every memory, yeah, 32 for sure.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   Yeah, I think that's a given.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   Even a 64 would be great.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   I think a given.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.160]   I think that video is a given, you know, taking a video, being able to record video.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.520]   Better cameras got to be in there.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   I mean, I was at this concert.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   I was so bummed.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.040]   I'm sitting, you know, 20 feet from staying.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.280]   And I can't get a decent picture because I'm on the iPhone, right, you know, a decent
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.200]   camera would make a big difference.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm hearing 3.2 megapixel camera.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.560]   I think that's the, that's kind of the standard.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   That's the minimum.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   I think it should be the minimum.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.000]   You know, where you get attention if you do a five megapixel or seven.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.760]   I think Apple doesn't feel like they need to.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.800]   You know, I think that Apple's like, you know, we'll give you a lot of the middle stuff
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.320]   because that's not, you know, we're not trying to out do everybody on this on the
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   Apple store.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   That's really what it's all about.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.240]   And they've won that.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.440]   There's nothing else, you know, can come close, even the pre, even if it's a better phone is
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.600]   an uphill battle just because of the app store.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   Right.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   What are they going to do?
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.760]   I mean, after a minute, if the video, if it was a more storage, if there was a better
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.480]   camera, that probably enough for me to upgrade.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.640]   You know, I don't think I would.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.720]   And I think that that's what Apple's looking for as a threshold.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.760]   But if it was a worse camera and they got you to Verizon, would you do it?
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Yes.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   There you go.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   So that's what they're looking for though.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.600]   That's exactly what they're looking for is where do we, how do we get people?
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.080]   A man named Verizon burned down my grandpa.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   You may be able to forgive Verizon, but around here, that's a point.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.080]   It's your bad name.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.040]   I don't like it.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.680]   SciStar out of out of business gone bankruptcy.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.640]   SciStar was the clone computing company.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   We have an Apple.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Did we really think ever?
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   We're really in the room and he's cheering now.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.760]   I guess he didn't like that a SciStar thing.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.440]   Do you really think that they really think that that was going to work out?
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   You mean once they got it?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.320]   No, I think that they thought maybe Apple wouldn't sue them.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.520]   No, I think what they thought is that Apple would simply say, tell you what, 10 MacBook
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.440]   pros, you give, you have one for each of you and all your friends and you go away.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.800]   I think that's, I think that they're expecting either be paid off.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.880]   It's like one of those like slip and fall lawsuits where you know that if you get in
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.560]   front of a judge in a jury, they're never going to believe your story about how this
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.520]   supermarket is liable for your injury.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.360]   But they know that Mel maybe they'll just give you $40,000 just to go away.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.600]   I think that it's either that or this is a point I've been making earlier that maybe
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.240]   there is a larger, more respectable PC maker.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   That's a said, you know what?
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.040]   We want to start making Mac clones.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   So let's try this.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   Really cheaply.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.240]   Well, we can't simply put our reputation on the line.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.600]   So let's invest in this company.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.680]   Let's approach a couple of people who have this sort of half baked idea and we'll say,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.280]   you know what, we're going to be a majority investor in your venture.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.560]   So you know what, if you get sued, guess what?
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.880]   We are your legal defense fund.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.080]   We will pay for that because what they're trying to buy is a judgment that outlines that
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.600]   Apple cannot prevent someone from making hardware that illegally purchased DVD of Mac
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.040]   OS can be installed upon.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.360]   And that would be a very, very valuable judgment.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.640]   That would be worth, if they cost them $500,000, if I start running, that would have been dirt
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   cheap.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.120]   Those are the only two answers that can possibly come up with.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.880]   Well, and apples come out with guns of blazing and that's it.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   So size there goes.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   Okay.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.320]   Yeah, folder tent, which by the way does suspend Apple's copyright suit.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.560]   But once the bankruptcy protection, the chapter 11 protection is sorted out according to Cnet
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.880]   News, Eric, all writing the copyright case can resume.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.680]   So you can't say that they've gone to the corner.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   Apple sitting there, Apple sitting there waiting for them.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.840]   So as soon as they step back out into the ring, Apple's going to start pumping.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.640]   And if I'm Apple, I come out with guns blazing.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.000]   I don't want to have to worry about this.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.880]   I want to put these guys out of business so nobody else gets this idea.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   Right.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.600]   That's the way Apple does all their legal actions.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.760]   And I think it's, in my opinion, it's a valid way to do business because you don't want
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.960]   to have to spend time messing around with this stuff.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.320]   If everybody understands, there will absolutely positively without any doubt be cost in screwing
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.880]   around here.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   You know, it's sort of like the burglar.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.120]   He sees 10 houses.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   One of them's gotten alarm.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.120]   He's going to pick one of the nine.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   It doesn't.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.120]   Right.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.840]   It's by the way, where we have a very large sign in front of the Twitter cottage that says
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   we have an alarm.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.880]   And you know what, Leo?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.400]   I've actually even gotten alarm.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.880]   Well, I find the sign is more than enough.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   You could buy those.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.200]   I'm not going to say, but one of my neighbors doesn't have an alarm, but does have a sign.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.840]   She bought it on eBay and she says the alarm is really not necessary if you have the sign
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.400]   because what criminals going to test to see if it's true.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.840]   See what I prefer is you have the sign out front and then on the, on the back door, you
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.600]   say, you know, on the gate that goes into the back area, you have, you know, guard dog.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   That's a good one.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.200]   And then you put right next to it and sure by Smith and Wes Smith and Wes.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.080]   We're just an NRA member NRA and good standing is probably good too.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.880]   I always like the new thing about the new school.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.360]   I've got a sign that says, it says this house is reserved.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.440]   This house is owned by a freelance journalist.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.640]   That means there's nothing inside.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   It's like putting that.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.040]   There's no radio in this car window that they do.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   Right.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.720]   The other, the other advantage that oftentimes I'll come home and find that there's like
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.240]   used clothing, canned goods on the front step.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   People are good.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   People out there are very, very kind-hearted, Leo.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.280]   We actually have some, actually, I should go get these.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.120]   Some listener of ours sent me rocks with hobo signs on them.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.120]   Rocks with hobo signs?
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.960]   You feel it while I get them.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.160]   Well, you know, I thought of, I thought of rocks with hobo signs.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   You know, I don't believe I remember.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.880]   You know, because especially when sitting around on the streets of Petaluma, you know,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.720]   sometimes I thought that that might be useful.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.880]   I might get a couple, a little spare change for lunch.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:18.400]   So these are Terry Pike, who is a summer, summeract@gmail.com, makes hobo rocks.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.880]   So this one is a red hobo.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.120]   It's felt covered rock with that sign.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   And that sign means a beating awaits you here.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.600]   So if you, if you, if you decide you don't want a hobo's anti, you put this sign out
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.360]   front, a beating awaits you here.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.680]   And then if you, if you're, if you're feeling good, you know, maybe you, maybe you got a
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   check.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   Food.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   This is a little kitty cat.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.040]   It says a kind-hearted woman lives here.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.200]   So do they, do they actually make sure that they're, they're having a hobo education?
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.680]   No, that's so they know what, what is it?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   Hobo's no.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   Look at the hobo code chart is fairly lengthy.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.400]   You actually, what I want to do is buy some of the ones that say a kind-hearted lady
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.880]   lives here and put them in all my enemy's doorsteps.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.280]   I was about to say is that like, like those, those fake canchy tattoos, they have a,
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.960]   the tattoo parlors where you think it means strength and fire.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.720]   It actually means pork sausage.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.320]   I love bacon.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.280]   That's what your tattoo says, folks.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   I have no idea.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.880]   I haven't spoken to a hobo and asked them if they still use the hobo code even.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.000]   I don't know if there are any hobo's left.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.840]   Well, all you have to do is wonder about 12 blocks in any direction in San Francisco.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.200]   You'll find those aren't hobo's technically.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   What is a hobo?
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   Those are failed.com CEOs.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   Hey, KA, hobo's.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   Those are technically not hobo bag.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   They're not hobo bag.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   They're not hobo bag.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   So this is good.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.360]   So some of these are hobo code chart.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.200]   Some of these are owner is out.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Oh, that's a good one.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   You're supposed to chalk these on the, on the, on the sidewalk.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   So there's one.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   There's one.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   Ward, Ward, Ward Chocking?
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   Yeah, it's like Ward Chocking.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.840]   In fact, that's where Ward Chocking came from is the hobo code.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.840]   Oh, really?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   This was used in the Great Depression.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   Here's one, Andy.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   You might want to put it out in front.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.600]   It's just put a circle and chalk on your sidewalk.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.680]   It means nothing to be gained here.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.080]   And actually that's kind of, that's our motto for the show, I believe.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.640]   That's my, that's my logo for my column.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   That's my column.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.400]   Nothing to be gained here.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:17.320]   Anyway, thank you, Terry for sending me hobo rocks and today, should we put the cat out,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.600]   or should we be beating a weight you here?
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.880]   Here we have that upside down.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   You have the beating.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   It looks like a Y.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.880]   The beating of weight is you here.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   No, it's the other way.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   It looks like a Y.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   It's really supposed to be like this.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   Which is funny because it's upside down.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.080]   It's like there's no way to get to where.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Oh, it's backwards?
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   Yeah, it's backwards.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.280]   Can we have a special rat hole jingle for any time we discuss about this?
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.400]   I gotta show you this.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.840]   One of our visitors here, can I say your name or is it secret?
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.800]   I won't say his name, but I am going to show you what he's got.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.880]   He's got an iPhone app that is like a ticker.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.080]   And he can type, he's typing messages to me right now on his ticker.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   I've never seen that.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   What's that app called?
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   Banner.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.720]   I need that app.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.320]   So he says, ask John Hodgeman about the Hobo code because of Chris John.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   Isn't that a good app?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.480]   It's a great app, especially for those visiting us in the studio.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.040]   Who needs to think and tell a prompter?
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.200]   I've always wanted a ticker for the back of my car.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.120]   So I can like communicate with the people that are like, you know, right behind me.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.320]   And what would you say to them now?
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.520]   It's back the F off.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.880]   Usually that's usually where it would be or your tank.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.600]   Usually I don't have a problem with people behind me though.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.800]   It's usually the people in front of me that I need to communicate with.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.000]   Do you own a car now?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   We got a car.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   He does.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   He had a own a car.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   He lives in the.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   We had a breakdown.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   We now that we live out here, we got a Honda CRX.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   We're in the birds.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   You got to have a car.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   The GPS.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   When did this happen?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.600]   Oh, it happened months ago.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.040]   I mean, now did you bring the Tom Tom to the dealership and then install it?
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.880]   I told Carly, I didn't even look at the car.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.040]   Carlita went to find the car.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   As you said, what should I get?
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.560]   I said, get whatever you want, but it has to have GPS built in.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   Oh, very smart.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.200]   I don't care what car you get.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   You got a CRV.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.120]   So she got a Honda CRV and she thought I was being a little extravagant about the whole
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   GPS thing.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.360]   And within two days, she was like, I cannot believe we didn't have this built into a
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   car before.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.880]   I wanted it built in because I didn't want my dad has a or had a now he has another one,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.600]   but had a Tom Tom, I think, or a Garmin or whatever.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.280]   And it was, you know, you leave it on the dashboard and it's a please break my window.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   I'm going to be very careful.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.720]   Having it built in just means that it's not that it.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.360]   Please break my window and my dashboard is what you're saying.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.400]   Yeah, it's not that useful when you pull it out.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   That's the problem.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.880]   Of all the years I've known you, Alex, I've never seen you drive a car.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.840]   In fact, I often wonder if you had a driver's license.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.760]   I still take the bus to the to San Francisco.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.040]   It's mostly just it's too inefficient to spend that much time in a car when I could
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.320]   be sitting there working on my computer.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.960]   They got Wi-Fi in the.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   Some of them, but I have I have the Verizon, you know, I might you need you.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.840]   So I sit on my Mac and I if you went in with your Wi-Fi, you'd be public, you know, giving
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.320]   everybody a good idea.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.400]   Hey, free Wi-Fi actually charge them five bucks.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.480]   You could you could amortize the whole thing.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.280]   What about this rumor that there is a new iPod nano?
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.640]   Actually, this this sounds like well, there's different rumors.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.160]   So one room, super nano one rumor from I pod lounge now called my lounge because they got,
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.800]   you know, sued is he they say an eyeliner.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.320]   And I think there's guys are very reliable.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.880]   This is from our sources never been wrong.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.920]   It is the biggest difference is the screen is widened to a 1.5 to 1 aspect ratio.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.000]   It makes a lot more sense.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Sure does.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.320]   I mean that nano now has the same size screen as the old nano, which means they just had
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   a bunch of screens left over in the now they've dumped them and now they can go to the wide
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.040]   screen.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:59.440]   Otherwise, no big improvements, although another source says that there's an iPod nano in
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.600]   the works with a camera.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.760]   That's when you put in there, Alex Lindsay.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.400]   That's the Apple and to it.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.360]   Yeah, it looks I mean it looks it looks like it's possible.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.480]   How many versions of the nano do we really need?
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.280]   Well, evidently it sells pretty well.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.440]   I think that's the issue.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.560]   So you want to you know, you see a lot of customization and a matte finish iPhone for
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.280]   China because Chinese don't like the shiny ones.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.800]   Apparently there's more scratch resistance more robust.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.080]   I would get one for my kid.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:36.520]   He said he's trash is I thought I would get I would get Matt over shiny shiny.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.080]   Yeah, because Matt doesn't show scratches.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   He's just cooler.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   Is it?
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.160]   I think it's cooler than shiny.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.440]   I want like a stealth iPhone that you know, you can't see on radar.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   They just phase out on.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.480]   You know what would actually would be required is you'd have to use have the rem the rem coding
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.680]   and then you'd also have to have the it had to be all angular at different angles to
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.640]   distribute the so it wouldn't be very round.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   The iPhone lack bird.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.600]   It'd be it looked kind of like an F one 17 except for an iPhone.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.120]   Well, you know the F one 17s are not flying anymore.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.760]   So there's a lot of rem coding and a lot of angular services that are laying around.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.080]   Yeah, just lying around.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.480]   That would be a good looking iPhone.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.440]   It would be a great if you could see it.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.080]   If you could you couldn't be able to find it.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   That's the problem.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   Yeah, you constantly lose.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Stealth phone.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.000]   Have you been following the Eucalyptus story?
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   This was the I felt so sorry for the developer on this one.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.400]   This is a really kind of good looking ebook reader, although $10 a little spent.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.800]   But Eucalyptus was blocked from the iPhone store because.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.840]   Commissutra.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.600]   You could search for and find the Commissutra.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   Commissutra.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   You have made a break.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.040]   Not because it came with the Commissutra.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.640]   Isn't this a problem that frankly any ebook reader would have?
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   Yes.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.880]   I mean, it makes you wonder about the whole like Kindle reader or the.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.000]   I'm sure I could find dirty stuff on the Kindle or Stanza.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.360]   Anyway, this is going to put the book burners out of business.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   You realize that.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   Very frustrating.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.560]   The whole notion of book burning is in real trouble because other way.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.640]   When you move all these books to an electronic age, you don't really have to burn them anymore.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   You just hit the lead.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   Delete them book the leaders.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.840]   Well, Eucalyptus is in the store now.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.240]   It does look really good.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.080]   I just wish it weren't $10.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.520]   But this is the thing.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.160]   This is where I think that Apple does a lot of stuff well, but this constant back and
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   forth where stuff's in, then it's out, then it's in, then it's out, it makes them look
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   bad.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Come on.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.360]   Whoever's in charge of this, get your act together and pick something and stick with it.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.400]   They said that the Eucalyptus author said that he had a recompile to make some changes
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   so that Apple would be happy.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.920]   And then they Apple said, we're fans.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   We love it.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   We're very impressed.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   Do we need another one?
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   Is it?
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   Is Stanza free?
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   I think Stanza is free.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   It's a problem.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   Do we really need it?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.840]   I think beyond whether Apple should have made it available or not, I think the uphill battle
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.000]   is you've got a good reader that's free.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.880]   I mean, this guy seems really nice.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.800]   The guy who, Jamie, the guy who wrote this, I'm impressed by his blog.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.880]   I mean, he's got some real skills with a Z.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.680]   But why $10, Jamie?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.880]   I mean, I think we should support him.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.440]   I just don't think you're going to, I mean, you could charge anything you want.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.640]   I just don't think anybody was going to buy it for $10 with Stanza being free.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.200]   Is it all for the page turn?
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   I just don't know.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.040]   When I saw the demo of it, I'm like, I really don't necessarily need a graphical page turn.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.200]   I just need the pages to be in front of them too.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   Right.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.520]   In fact, I kind of don't like the graphical.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.280]   It's difficult when you're competing in a market that has two apps as good as Stanza
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.760]   and the Kindle reader.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.040]   You have to start off with, give me one good reason why I should use your app and not
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   these other two.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.040]   And there are a couple of other apps that do that by doing things that like what Eucalyptus
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.520]   does, by simply saying, we are going to be so tightly integrated with Gutenberg and archive.org
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:56.120]   and all these other repositories of public domain books that it'll be just like you
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.640]   have an 80,000 book library right plugged into your iPhone.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.240]   As far as I can see so far, Eucalyptus, at least the demo doesn't do anything more than
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.000]   show what cool transitions they have and cool graphics they have.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.760]   Now, I've yet to download it.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.200]   I haven't tried it out yet.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.800]   And I'm looking forward to seeing if that makes it a more usable experience.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.120]   I mean, when you hit, this guy has the freakiest URL ever.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.400]   And I hope it's things made out of other things where th dot blah blah dot gs anyway.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.920]   But it has a really powerful graphical demo of what this thing looks like when you're
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.120]   using it, which strikes me immediately as this either is going to be the coolest way
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:42.200]   to read books and that it's so tactile and so familiar in how I handle real books or
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.640]   after the first day, it's going to get really old and I'm going to be like, Oh, for God's
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:52.400]   sakes, just open the thing that I tapped and go to page one, please.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.560]   Jamie publishes on his blog a very good.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.600]   He puts all the Apple emails, the back and forth that he had with Apple and so forth
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   in his blog.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.200]   It's really it's worth reading.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   So in fact, he was able to appeal and by appealing, they were able to come up with a compromise
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   and get it in there.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:25.920]   And so it does kind of highlight the basic problem with the eye to store the iPhone
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   at store.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.240]   But I think that ultimately they get were able to reach a this is just going to be complicated
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.240]   for Apple.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   I mean, that's the issue.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   We talk about this every week now.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.280]   It's it's but the question is, how do you, you know, where do you open it up?
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.800]   Well, so what he did is he's manually blocking the comma suture from that's it.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.400]   I mean, what I mean, it points out in this exchange that you can get there for different
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.560]   copies of the comma suture, you can get on the Kindle on the Kindle application and they
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.560]   charge for it.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.680]   Not to mention all the soft core porn that you can download.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   Right.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   What happened to San Francisco liberals?
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   Where are they in Cupertino?
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   It's a little bit.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   No, it's not.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   Conservative down there.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   I guess so.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.280]   Anyway, Jamie Montgomery, his blog is blog.monkemory with an IE.net.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.000]   I think I think in the guidelines, I just say, if you can't imagine it being in a Pixar
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.600]   movie, you probably shouldn't.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   Right.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.400]   But look at all the things that are on here that you.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.880]   That's a good way out.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:32.080]   Any other stories we want to talk about before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   We talk about rumors.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:41.640]   We talk about SciStar.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   I don't know that somebody, somebody bookmarked this on the cult of the Mac page.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.120]   Safari is a fat hog that spies on you.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   Porn mode doesn't work.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.720]   Porn mode doesn't work.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.680]   I like that.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.360]   That's a word of warning.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.320]   I didn't realize there was a, I just, I never found the buttons in porn mode.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.720]   I've been looking for that button for six years.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   Where is it?
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.200]   Evidently, when you turn it on, everyone is naked.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Porn mode.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   That's Leander Kehaney.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.520]   Go read his a, I mean, that's, that's link bait.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.200]   If ever I heard one, here's some good news.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.920]   CES according to CNET, CES is going to expand the Apple section.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.000]   That's good because with a move of Mac world to February, CES is wide open for Apple fans
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.640]   to go in January.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.520]   There's going to be an eye lounge pavilion, an exhibition area for products related to
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.960]   the Mac, iPod and iPhone.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.560]   Also a section for applications for use on Apple products.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.080]   Usually you don't see software at CES.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.600]   It almost feels like they're going, they're really going after Mac world.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.040]   They're going after the Mac world people.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.360]   If 4,000 square foot space sold out within days of the announced availability.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   Wow.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.920]   I think that's great.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.040]   You know, I don't think that that precludes appearing at Mac world expos, certainly Mac
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.720]   world expos bigger than 4,000 square feet for one thing.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   Absolutely.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.320]   But it is, it's an inch, yeah, it's kind of an interesting.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.120]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   It was 4,000 square feet last year.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   It is 25,000 square feet this year.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   Oh, now that's a different horse altogether.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.480]   This is a huge, this is a huge play.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.200]   Oh.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.600]   That's getting pretty close to the North Hall.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   I mean, it's not.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.600]   That's big.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   That's closing.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.920]   That's like, what's 5,000 by 5 feet?
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.400]   I can tell you where I'm going to be that week now.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.680]   That would be a 5,000 foot long by 5 foot wide strip.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.640]   Good to know.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.200]   Or 250 by 100.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.840]   250 feet by 100 is probably better.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.760]   Oh, it's more than 250 feet by 100, is it?
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   Is that it?
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   That's 25,000 square feet.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   Well, that's not that big.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   Well, it's big.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.200]   It's a football field long and almost a third of a football field.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.680]   I mean, it's like a football field, which is about the size of the football field.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   I guess you're right.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   Which is what Mac wrote.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   I mean, it's about the size of the football field.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   You're right.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   It's clearly a play.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.600]   When you move from 4,000 square feet to 25,000, then they said they sold it out.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.800]   Well, I'm still not the original.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.080]   They sold out the original and that's when they expanded it.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   But here's the thing.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:10.360]   I mean, people like me, I have that permanent hole in my schedule for years.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.160]   And when they moved it, I can't go now to the one in February I'd like to.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.320]   So I have that hole in my schedule in January, so I'll go to Vegas now.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.440]   Well, let's do both.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   Why not?
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.960]   And I suppose we should cover both.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.840]   I haven't been to CS before years.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.440]   I can't be at the one in February.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   That's right.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.440]   You're your double book.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   I'm double booked.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440]   But I will be now, I wasn't going to go to CS.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.240]   I haven't been in years, but I will go now because if there's going to be some Mac stuff
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.880]   there, that'll tone down the anti-Mac flavor of the event.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.040]   And that'll be interesting.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.600]   I think it'll really depend.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:50.400]   Usually I start getting contacted by PR people about four months before CES.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:55.240]   I think the tone and the tenor of the contacts that I get at that time from Mac people and
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.640]   from Apple companies, companies that make iPod and Mac stuff, is going to really teach
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.480]   me a lot about where people are moving.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.560]   Because if this just becomes, well, we have to show somewhere, so I guess we'll show
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.520]   it's CES and that's kind of OK.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:14.280]   And if it becomes, gee, we don't want to make this big buy in two big shows in January and
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   February.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.360]   So we were on notice, Mr. Enochico, that we are now doing our annual big thing at CES instead
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   of Mac world.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   So it's interesting.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.440]   I mean, we all know that the next year we're not going to know how things are going to shake
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.720]   out until they actually shake up.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.720]   Right.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   This is obviously a huge play on CES as part.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.120]   They're not being quiet about this.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.520]   They're saying we want to be the new Mac world expo.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.240]   Probably not unexpected either.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.960]   I don't expect it, but this is a pretty big grab.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   We are going to be doing a full day at Mac world expo.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.920]   I'm going to be hosting Mac world live, the big keynote that David Poe used to do.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   Now he's doing the main keynote.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.280]   So we're going to be shooting like crazy at Mac world expo.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.920]   And we'll broadcast live all day there.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.240]   In fact, I think we're going to do Twitter.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   We'll do Mac break weekly.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   So it's where's it going to be?
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.800]   San Francisco at the Muscone usual spot, North Hall.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.240]   Yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.400]   We really planned when we've been scaling up our coverage of Mac world every year.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   And you know, we're just going to keep on scaling.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.040]   And we're excited about covering, you know, especially the, you know, all the vendors
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.240]   there and all the goings on.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   Cool.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.520]   It's exciting.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.240]   That's exciting.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.040]   Let's get to our picks of the week this week.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.200]   And we will do that in just a moment.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   But first I want to mention this show is brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.760]   Audible.com/Macbreak the place to go to get your audio entertainment.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.280]   We're all Audible fans.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   We all listen to these great audio books, 50,000 plus in the store there.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.520]   Just wonderful selection of fascinating, fun books you can learn.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.680]   You can be entertained.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.640]   The readers are so great.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.120]   And if you go there right now, you could get your first book free.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.640]   If you go to audible.com/Macbreak, you could sign up for the gold plan.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   That's a one book, a month plan.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.560]   And that first book, that first credit is yours absolutely free.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:01.760]   In fact, even if you decide not to stick around, you cancel any time you get to keep the book.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.600]   That's one of the beauties of it.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.280]   I don't want to put you on the spot, Andy.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.800]   Do you have a book for us?
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.360]   Yes, I do.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.600]   And the books that I read and the books that I listen to, I mean, I'm like anybody else.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.240]   I pick them for a lot of different reasons.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.200]   Sometimes it's because I know that I will deeply, profoundly enjoy it.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.680]   I'll be entertained.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:27.880]   But it's also very credible to read a book that you're reading the first chapter in the
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.960]   bookstore or the free sample of Ikindle.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.600]   And you're just getting so upset by what you're reading.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.080]   Or rather, you're disagreeing with what the person is saying.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.600]   And you're just thinking, oh man, I understand your basic argument, but it's flawed here,
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.680]   here, and here.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.880]   And your entertainment is not necessarily there on the page, but how you are reacting
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.880]   to it.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.440]   The fact that it's making you think and making you try to order all kinds of thoughts that
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.640]   you've had in your head for a long time, but have never really had a chance to really
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.520]   put them together into one argument or to one opinion before.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.640]   And a while ago, we had a previous example of this with Richard Dawkins, the God delusion,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   which I thought was pretty flawed and made a lot of strumming arguments.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.520]   But part of the fun of reading that book was just saying, oh, Dawkins, you are so full
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   of it.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.640]   Here are the eight reasons why you're full of it on this page alone.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.040]   I've got a new one in that same vein.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.200]   It's called Digital Barburism, a writer's manifesto by Mark Helprin.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:31.320]   And it's a book about the evolution of what copyright means and what intellectual property
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.480]   rights are half to mean in the digital age.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   The author is a best-selling novelist who wrote an op-ed piece, I believe, for The New
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.160]   York Times, basically complaining about the sense of entitlement that he perceived in
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.360]   a lot of people these days.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   While there is a movement these days to not just simply take copyright law back into control
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.800]   because that's a big problem.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.400]   The whole principle of copyright is that I, as an author, get exclusive rights to the
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.720]   work that I create and protected by the law for a certain amount of time.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.000]   But at a certain point, that has to end and that what I write gets released into the public
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.720]   domain, where anybody can adapt it, anybody can modify it, anybody can sell it, anybody
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.800]   can translate it.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.720]   And that whole system only works if that copyright term ends.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:23.640]   And a lot of people are getting righteously upset that certain companies are using Congress
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.360]   to get those terms extended and extended.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   Disney.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   Mickey Mouse.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.280]   To name but one.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.680]   To name the one.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.280]   But there are people who go off the deep end of the other side too saying, "Oh, well,
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.080]   copyrights are fascist.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:49.480]   I don't know why creators are dinosaurs who don't understand that if I take your work
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.280]   and make 40,000 copies of it and give it away, that publicizes your work.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   And so if you want to start making t-shirts based on your work, you can now have a bigger
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   market for that."
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.720]   Well, in my argument is that, "Well, maybe I don't want to be in the t-shirt selling
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   business.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.920]   Maybe I don't want to be in the public speaking business.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.740]   Maybe I actually want to be in the business of writing novels that people then buy or
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.200]   then I, or at least that I want to control the distribution of.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   Already you see how interesting I find this book because again, you really want to start
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   arguing against the narrator or with the narrator.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.920]   These are the sort of issues that Mark Helperin gets into.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.600]   Now, the reason why it becomes, I argue with my dashboard as I'm driving and listening
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:31.040]   to this is that he really does take a really nonsensical attitude.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.600]   You seem to get the impression that he does think that copyright should be extended indefinitely,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.680]   that the fact that he created a certain work means that the public never has any right to
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.000]   get their own unrestricted access to it.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.600]   And that's something that I absolutely disagree with this, fervently as I disagree with people
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.080]   who think that there should be no copyright protection to begin with.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.160]   So it's the Unabridged version.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.480]   The original book is less than 300 pages, so the Unabridged version is about nine hours.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   Again, what's it called?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Give me the title.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.600]   It's called "Digital Barburism, a Writer's Manifesto."
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.880]   And if you actually, if you Google for that by Mark Helperin, and if you do a Google on
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.080]   that, you'll find a whole bunch of really interesting discussion about it.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:19.880]   Lawrence Lessig, the pope of copyright reform, came up with a really nice essay on his site,
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.360]   Lessig.org, called "The Slopsist and the Internet," which is just a long PDF that's
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:30.160]   not quite so long, but a very, very careful dissection of this other authors' point of
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.200]   view and where he's sort of making his boundaries.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:38.840]   And like I said, a book that you disagree with but then provokes exactly the sort of discussion
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.760]   and debate, not only within yourself, but also in the world that's trying to figure
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.000]   out what we're going to be doing about copyrights in the future.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.680]   I think it's a very, very valuable book.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.840]   It's certainly a very, very entertaining book.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.920]   I'm been told that there are now 60,000 titles total at Amazon.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   At amazonaudible.com.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   Who records all those?
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   Somebody.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.880]   They've asked me to record one.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.280]   I have to pick a book.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   You want to record all?
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   I'll talk to them.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.560]   I want to, but I have to pick a book.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.960]   What do you, yes, you too, Andy.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.960]   You can do a book.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960]   I want to record a book.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:12.000]   I want to record a book on weight loss.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.240]   It's like when Dr. Phil did that weight loss book.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.800]   I thought, wait a minute, Dr. Phil, you're not that.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.720]   He's not exactly a spelled guy, is he?
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.720]   I don't understand.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.880]   Is this how to look like you?
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.880]   Do as I do.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.240]   I'm going to write one thing for weight loss.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.880]   It's called Eat Less and Exercise More.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   Exercise More.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.880]   I read that book.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   Good book.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:41.080]   Audible, 60,000 titles at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.480]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.880]   They're a great company with great products and they save my life.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.560]   I drove down to the concert last night.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.880]   I thought, how did I do this for 13 years?
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.960]   And then I remembered.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   I did it because I had audible.com.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.120]   I've been listening to outliers, which is.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   Oh, isn't that great?
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.120]   And he reads it so well.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.120]   Knock them quite well.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.600]   And again, is another one of the examples that I don't agree with everything?
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.200]   You know, I'm going to go, oh, I don't really know about that.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   But it's very thought-provoking.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   And it's great.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.120]   It's the perfect thing to be cleaning my house to.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:14.760]   I'm just doing something and working on it or I'm walking here and listening to it.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.120]   And it's just a great thing to have going on in the background and have my mind doing
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.480]   something while I'm doing something else.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.960]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.200]   First one's free.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.560]   You're going to get hooked.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.120]   So I'm going to do my pick first.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   Go.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.520]   Because I'm actually playing it right now and I really can't stop playing it.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:39.160]   It's called Plants versus Zombies.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.360]   And my friends, this is the most addictive.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.240]   You know, it's kind of like tower defense.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.200]   Yeah, it's not coming up on the screen there.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.720]   Alex, you're just going to have to trust me on this.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:58.160]   You are a gardener and the zombies are coming in to your little garden and you've got to
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.320]   defend it with plants.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:06.800]   Peashooting plants, zombie eating plants, giant potatoes that block the zombies.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   And here they come.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.760]   I'm going to put up my peashooter plant.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   Here comes a zombie.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   They move very slowly.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.200]   That's the good news on this.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   And it's just totally addictive.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.120]   It's from PopCap Game.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   You can download it.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.720]   PopCap Games does the greatest stuff, you know what I mean?
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.200]   By the way, it's Windows or Mac.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.880]   Okay, so it's not an iPhone game.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   No, not yet.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.560]   Although I imagine they'll do an iPhone game at some point.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.240]   Let me put the peashooter here and we can start shooting this zombie.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   There we go.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.240]   He's not going to like that.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.960]   But they're slow moving.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.160]   That's deceptive though, because eventually they start to move in on you.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   There's a lot of them.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.520]   I'm going to put up a giant potato and block this one.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   Anyway, I can't stop playing this thing.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.400]   It is totally addictive.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.000]   And by the way, Felicia Day, I blame her for this.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   It's all her fault.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   She was twittering.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.080]   She said, "I can't stop playing this game."
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.040]   I thought, "That's the kind of game I'm looking for."
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.400]   See, that's the kind of game I try not to put on my computer.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.320]   I mean, it's bad enough field runners.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.800]   It's still like, you know, I'm still...
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.560]   This is like field runners only with zombies and plants instead.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.560]   I know, I don't want to know.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   I don't want to know.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   I'm keeping my eye on it.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.560]   It's not on your phone though.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   So that's the good news.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:16.720]   And in a way, it's a little more complex game because you have to plant stuff that gives
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.760]   you the resources to defend yourself.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.240]   So it's kind of a fun game in that respect.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.880]   A more fun and better game is actually the thing that I'm not looking for.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   Oh, come on!
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   Boring and something else.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   I got to tear it up.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.440]   My wife finally came out.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.520]   It was about 11.30 at night, a couple of nights ago.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.080]   She said, "You are a freak.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.480]   Stop playing that game."
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.520]   I said, "One more round.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   Just one more round.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.800]   I'm winning."
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:48.000]   You gain a big arsenal of stuff that you can use to fight against the zombies.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   So it's kind of...
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.360]   You know, it's more fun than that.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.240]   You're looking at me funny.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.400]   It's more fun.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.640]   I know it's fun.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   It's when tower defense.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   I don't want to have one anymore.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.280]   That's why Alan does a fun here.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.760]   Fieldrunners is all the fun I can do.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.080]   You can't really stop playing it.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   That's the only...
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.320]   Uh-oh, here comes the zombies.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.520]   As our audience has well noticed, finally.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.520]   Now.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.000]   And the great thing is, this game was just tailor-made for radio and podcasting.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.840]   It has some good sounds.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   It almost comes alive.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.280]   Okay, so now look, this zombie is about to get my sunflower.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.400]   You use the sunflowers to generate sun, which you need.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.800]   And as soon as he gets my sunflower, he's going to get into my house.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.840]   But fortunately, I have one last line of defense.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.720]   A lawnmower, which is going to run him right down.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.760]   And so ends.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.360]   Plants versus zombies.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.560]   My pick of the week.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.800]   Isn't that a Robert Plant song?
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.400]   Oh, so it's 1995 is the...
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   20 bucks.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.360]   But you can download a level, you know, I think the first few levels.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.680]   But don't, you know, don't because you will have to pay for it.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.200]   I mean, really is that addictive.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.560]   Stop looking at that, Alex.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   Put it away.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   Put away the zombies.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.920]   I'm so big I hit the download button.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   That's really compelling.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.800]   Oh, and when you get the license, you can install it on five machines.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.040]   So you really have it everywhere you want to be.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.560]   That way everywhere you go, zombies will catch you.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.800]   Zombies, it's really, it's really fun.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.800]   Alex, stop down.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.120]   I'm going to do you a favor.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   What's your pick, Alex?
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   It's too late.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.480]   It's already in the pipe.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   It is really fun.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   It's whimsical.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.880]   Okay, I have two, I have two picks.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   Yes.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.520]   So, can I always feel like there's so many iPhone apps and so many computer apps and I
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   think it's so many.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.000]   I'm keeping really short.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.280]   The first one is one that I just saw, I don't know, I saw it passing by on the news and
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.680]   it's for the iPhone called Brushes.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   Have you seen this?
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.240]   Well, you know why it's in the news.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.360]   It's because it's going to be used for the cover of the New Yorker.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.200]   In the first New Yorker magazine, the entire cover is painted on an iPhone.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.360]   And I have to admit, I downloaded it.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.640]   It is a lot of fun.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   So is it just like a paint program?
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.040]   It's like a little paint program.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.760]   So you can create a canvas and you really can, you know, draw.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.160]   You can build different brushes.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.640]   You can, you know, it's quite a, you know, you really, you can build up density.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.400]   You can, you know, it's quite a, it's quite a drawing app.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.920]   You know, and so, you know, it's fun to doodle.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.560]   You know, and this is a great, I mean, this is a high end.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.360]   That's what Bob, we were saying last night at the concert.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.480]   Oh, no, Wang Dang doodle.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.920]   It's so close.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   So anyway, it's a great little application.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   Oops, I just bought it.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   This is what we do.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   You're listening to it.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.320]   And then we just buy everybody, everyone, everyone.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.840]   I meant to click the link to show it.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840]   You know, I do that a lot.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   Instead, I bought it.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.840]   Yeah, it's, they're going to, they're going to use that like as a pull quote on the side.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840]   Oops, I bought it.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   Oops, I bought it.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.120]   So Leo says, oops, I bought it.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.840]   So anyway, I, I, it is, if you're looking for something that has a little bit more control
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.680]   than the Etch-O-Sketch or, or a little drawing, you really want something to do.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.280]   But can you with your finger really do, you know, great paintings?
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   They have some examples there that I'm assuming that they did.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   I can't get them.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   Marker cover.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.540]   So do you do, do you, do the canvas larger than the phone?
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.540]   Is that why you can do the detail that they're talking about?
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.540]   You know, I think it is.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.940]   Although I've been mostly working with just the, I've been working with the area that
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.940]   I have.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.140]   This reminds me very much of, of painter.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.760]   Stroke recording brushes now records your brush strokes so you can replay your paintings
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.480]   and export them at high resolutions using brushes viewer, a Mac OS 10 app.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480]   That's cool.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   You can zoom.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.560]   The New Yorker site actually has the video capture of that cover being produced.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560]   That's one of the things I love to do.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.560]   And clearly the guy is a real artist because you can see him working from back to front using
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.280]   the techniques that a real artist would work, but it is really impressive.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   Really cool thing to watch.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   Wow.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.640]   I'm going to have to go look at that.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.840]   So that's just a, is it just like a quick time video on there?
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.840]   I believe they have it as, I don't know, it's streaming something.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.120]   Let me see if I can find that.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]   Where is it?
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   I'd like to play it back just to see it.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   Oh, it's a little bit of a bite.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Don't worry about it.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   It's okay.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   The one thing that happens, you have to see it.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   Here it is.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.960]   You do have to move kind of slowly when you're making curves because you still get the kind
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.120]   of the polygonal look if you move too quickly.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   We don't want to go up.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.960]   But if you're doing like, if you're acting like an artist with brushes, it actually
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   works pretty well.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.240]   So anyway, that's my iPhone app.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.120]   Do you think that the, that the artist did this for the New Yorker and then they made
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.240]   a big deal out of it or?
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.000]   I believe, if I recognize this guy's style, he's actually quite famous for doing iPhone
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.080]   paintings this way.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.160]   He says that he can do it because he can paint people without them knowing.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.560]   He just looks like he's looking at his phone.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.720]   So he can actually do illustrations that way, which I think is really clever.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   And looking at the, looking at the video they show back, I mean, yeah, you definitely have
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.920]   the kinds of capabilities that an artist would be looking for in an iPhone app.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.560]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.000]   Wow.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.760]   I wonder if the plan.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.980]   So in other words, you're saying that, but do you think they commissioned him because
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.540]   he's an iPhone painter?
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.540]   I do not know.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.560]   They're very digital nowadays at the New Yorker.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560]   Well, it's good.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.880]   Our achievements took over a number of years ago.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.600]   I mean, he is the cartoonist, cartoonist.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   So he's really, he's not in any way traditionalist.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   So this is exactly the sort of thing you'd expect him to do.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.120]   He's responsible for their covers and art now.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.520]   Yeah, that's why I know that.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.080]   And was on the cover a few years ago.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.160]   That's why Seth is on the cover.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.760]   That's why Chris Ware, I think Chris Ware was doing a couple of covers.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.400]   I love Art Spiegelman.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.160]   I interviewed him when Mouse came out.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.320]   He is just incredible.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.640]   Just incredible.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   Very cool brushes.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   I just bought it.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   There you go.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   I just bought it.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   I just bought it.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   That's the new thumbs up from Leo.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.480]   I'll be giving you my review.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.520]   And standby for brushes too, which will be available in 15 minutes.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.240]   Oops, I just bought it.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.720]   So my application is a little more expensive.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   Oh, you have two.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   That's a long time.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   I can save it.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   I can do two.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   Save it.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720]   I'll save it.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   'Cause I had two too, but I decided to save it.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   I'll save it.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   I'll save it.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.360]   I'll have a really good app that's just moved to the Mac that I got a demo of and I like
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   it a lot.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.920]   You know, mine is something that I'm going to use on the crews for my presentations.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.720]   It's the best thing I ever use on your iPhone.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.720]   On your iPhone?
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.720]   No.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   Do you have the iPhone controller?
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   Yes.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720]   I love that.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.720]   Pretty key.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720]   The keynotes.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.880]   I'm such a tease.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.720]   You, Scottborn, you, you're next.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   Okay.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:16.520]   There are many, many places online to get great information about using creative software.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.960]   Linda.com, you've heard me talk about in the past.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.240]   We all know that you can get lots of great training.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.000]   I mean, really great training from Pixel Core.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.680]   But I've come upon a place over the last couple of months that I've been going to over and
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.080]   over called Kelby Training.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.480]   Oh, Scott Kelby.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.880]   Scott Kelby's deal.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.680]   If you're a National Association of Photoshop professionals member, and of course you should
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.320]   be if you use Photoshop, the price ends up being $17 a month.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   That's good.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:53.120]   And if this is very Nikon and photography and Adobe-centric, so those are the titles.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.340]   But if you're into those things for $17 a month, I have to say there's a very wide
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.440]   variety of information here.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.920]   And the Kelby folks are really doing things.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.640]   Well, I have my hats off to them, even though there's a place or two where we all compete.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.840]   This is a place where they do a wonderful job.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.440]   And I say that having my own training titles over at Linda.com.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.000]   That's quite a bit actually, Scott, that you recommend it.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   But I have to say, yeah, I have to say for $17 a month, if you're into those areas, now
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.200]   Linda.com has a slightly broader variety of information available.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.320]   But if you're into photography, particularly if you're into Nikon photography, because
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.560]   they've got Joe McNally, who's one of the hottest teachers on the planet right now.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.160]   And if you're into Photoshop or anything at Adobe, the best guys in the business are
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   here.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.680]   And the breadth of knowledge that they offer is quite shocking to me, frankly, that this
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.240]   level of information is available in this way.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.560]   So I want to highly recommend it.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:58.280]   You know, $17 if you're a Photoshop NAPP member, $19 a month, or $199 a year for everybody
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   else.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   Wow.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   And that's it.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   KelbyTraining.com.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.400]   I also want to mention that I'm proud to have been asked by the folks there to lead one
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.520]   of their worldwide photo walks going on July 18th.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.640]   And they've got more than 400 cities signed up.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.800]   I'll be leading one in Portland.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   And that's it.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.560]   That's going to be the world's largest ever combined photo walk.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   Wow.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   I mean, largest in terms of the number of participants.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.440]   Yeah, because there's more than 400 cities and they limit each one to 50, assuming they
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   all fill up.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   I love photo walks.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.400]   I want to do a photo walk with you.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.840]   Well, you're welcome to come up, even though the technically we're sold out on the makeup
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.560]   place, you'd mock me.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.560]   I would not.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.800]   You say the port, take your lens cap off you.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.520]   I would do that, but it wouldn't be mocking.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.920]   It would be destruction.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.080]   You're welcome to come to anything I'm at ever.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.840]   And you know that you're a deer.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.440]   You make a sound as though like Scott run these things like pro wrestling with a, they
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.640]   have some guy on the role of the MOOC.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   I'm the MOOC.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.760]   They have to like stand up on the turnbuckle and make a lot of problems.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   The MOOC.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.760]   Hey, Mr. Moocanock.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   Okay.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.640]   So by the way, that's KelbyTraining.com.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   Thank you, Scott.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   Thank you.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   Welcome, Mr. Enocho.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   Your pick, sir.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.400]   I do have a pick, although again, I blacked out the camera for a good 30 seconds.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.480]   So I could verify that my shirt is provided by the leveling event from the Hawaii Barra
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480]   shirt foundation.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   I'm laugh.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.920]   Hawaii Barra laugh.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:28.200]   Why a barra may your free life free for pocket, removal, color stays generous sizing and casual,
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.160]   but dressy box front design.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.160]   Hawaii Barra.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.120]   Every hill 60609.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   You had me a generous styling.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   Exactly.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.680]   I get it.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.840]   It's definitely tailored just like my internet pants.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.360]   They're tailored for sitting and typing for long three.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360]   Excellent.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.360]   Excellent.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360]   Very, very grateful for it.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360]   Excellent.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.680]   So, but the, my pick of the week is a really cool DVD utility called Fairmount.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   It's free.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   It's open source.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.680]   You can get it at metakeen.com.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.880]   M-E-T-A-K-I-N-E.com.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.400]   Now, we all know that Handbrake is this really, really awesome tool just for ripping commercial
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.800]   DVDs into quick time files and to MP4 files.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.720]   However, what it can't do is, but Fairmount does something very, very different, very,
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   very simple.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.720]   What it does is it works in tandem with the VLC media player.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:25.400]   When you have this software installed, anytime you insert a commercial DVD in the background,
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.760]   Fairmount will simply bamboozle the operating system into thinking that it's simply an
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.920]   unprotected, unlocked, plain vanilla DVD.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.680]   And once that happens, that opens up a whole world of possibilities to you.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.160]   Among them, you could simply burn a duplicate of that DVD without copy protection.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   Oops.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   I just installed it.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.960]   So, you can also do things like back, just simply copy the video directories directly
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.600]   onto your, like onto your two terabyte hard drive.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.640]   But now, instead of just having like the movie from Star Trek, you will have the movie and
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.840]   all the menus and all the special features and all the commentary tracks because you
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   have-
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   And DVD player plays it, right?
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   You don't even-
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   Exactly.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.000]   You will have an exact duplicate of everything that's on that disc the way that it was meant
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.040]   to be presented.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.560]   And now that you can get a terabyte worth of storage for 90 bucks, now why bother ripping
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.160]   discs when you can really reliably afford to have a couple hundred full DVDs on that
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160]   drive?
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.480]   And like I said, it's just a really good resource.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.760]   So I've been using Elgato has their H.264 hardware accelerators that will USB thing
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:35.960]   mabob that you plug in and offers hardware accelerated compression into H.264.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.920]   What you can do now, because the software that this hardware thing provides with you
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.400]   doesn't rip commercial DVDs, but it can process those original video folders so that if you
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:53.240]   use Fairmount to strip with the DVD stuff, the copy protection, now you can simply drag
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:59.280]   that folder into Elgato's application and now you're getting DVD ripping at greatly
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.760]   accelerated rates, about three or four times faster than what handbrake can give you.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.720]   So Fairmount doesn't really have any interface, it just runs in the background.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.600]   There's a window if you want to take a look at it.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.360]   Really all that happens is that when you insert it, you'll suddenly see a picture of
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:19.120]   a DVD with like locks and cream cheese being spread over over it.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.600]   And when the entire thing has been spread with cream cheese, you know that it's done
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.840]   and it will mount that just as a regular DVD.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.240]   Now it does have to do a whole bunch of math to crack the copy protection on this.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.720]   So it's not as if you pop it in three seconds later, the DVD is available, but we're talking
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.960]   about minutes rather than hours.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.200]   And again, given that it lets you do things with that DVD, you couldn't do otherwise.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.320]   And again, if you have hardware accelerators that allows you to rip that disc and a factor
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.640]   of again, two to four times faster than you could just with handbrake alone, that's a
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   really, really big deal.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.520]   Well, I'm going to use this in my home theater PC because what I want to do is put in DVD's
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   copy them to the hard drive so that I can use front row or boxy or whatever I'm using
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.120]   for my home theater interface, XBMC to play the DVDs off the hard drive.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.160]   So this is perfect for that.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   Right.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.160]   It just simplifies that process.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.640]   I just copy them basically, drag and drop.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640]   Right.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   Find your copy.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   I love that.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.360]   So what happens if they get sued into the ground and they won't?
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.520]   You know why they're not doing, are they doing anything?
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.720]   No, they're well, well, both of what they're doing is all the copy, all the digital millennium
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.600]   copyright violations are being done by VLC media players.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.200]   That's what I was thinking VLC does.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.800]   But the back of their, their key is in memory decrypted now.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.680]   What's VLC launches?
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.720]   And now all they're doing is, do they have to decrypt the content when they decrypt it?
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   They're, they're cracking the license.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.840]   Typically, typically, this has been done before.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.360]   There's a product for Windows called any DVD that works very, very well.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360]   Right.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.000]   And usually the way that they get around these restrictions are either by the violation part
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.280]   is sold from a company that's owned by a Belgian holding company or they simply take
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.840]   the part that violates the copyright and simply moves it into another product that they don't
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.880]   have to care about like an open source project.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.960]   It seems to be that this is what they're doing.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.800]   It's a free open source project.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.200]   They are saying that the magic stuff that breaks the DVD is not any code that's actually inside
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.800]   their own app so that if someone tried to come after them, they'd have to be really threatening
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.920]   and really intimidating and really make a very, very good case that this would not be thrown
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   out at the first level.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   Again, I'm not a lawyer.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.600]   I'm sure that they've talked to people.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.160]   Given how good the Medi-Kean website is, I'm guessing this isn't just two guys, two guys
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.920]   looking for beer money, especially since they're not charging anything.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.480]   It's open source.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.280]   But it looks, it looks pretty good.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.440]   It does, from a user point of view, I can tell you it works great.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.880]   Again, I'm sort of now in the process of, well, maybe I'll just rip this later.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.000]   Maybe I'll convert it to like an iPhone familiar format later.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.600]   Right now, I just want it on the hard drive so I can access it on the network.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.120]   And so from that point of view, again, until the government comes in and breaks into my
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.720]   house and takes it off my hard drive, I'll be a happy, fair amount user.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   Love it.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]   Love it.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   Love it.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.720]   Love it.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.320]   Thank you, Mr. Andy and Ako.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:09.960]   Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen, the show has concluded you may now resume your life.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.360]   Break time is over.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   Thank you.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360]   Glad you said that.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360]   I couldn't remember it.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.360]   [laughter]
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:34.840]   [music]
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.000]   (upbeat music)
