[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all things.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   Apple, the Macintosh, the iPhone, the Zoom.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   No wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   I'm going to scratch that one.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, here in the studio with me today,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600]   Professor Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.440]   >> Hello.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.200]   >> Doctor of Apology.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.120]   >> Yes.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.280]   >> And his little sidekick, Andy Anatko.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.560]   Mr. Sideburns himself.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.680]   Good to see you, Andrew.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.600]   >> Good to be here.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.440]   I have not been on the show for three weeks,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.200]   so listeners can only imagine the great quantities
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.160]   of intelligence, wit, insight, and brilliance
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.360]   that have been pent up for three weeks
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.560]   that will all be coming in a huge violent corner.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320]   >> Oh, geez.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.120]   It would be just the way great Dan--
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.200]   >> Let me get my gum boots on and my slicker.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.000]   >> There is my sarcastic way of saying low expectations.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.120]   Please, I have my next book due tomorrow.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.760]   And I had a nice 36 hours in which I was actually rested
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   and alert over the past two weeks.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.160]   >> I am so gentle.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   >> I'm still gentle.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.920]   I'm still not over it.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880]   I cannot get my sleep habits right.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.960]   Are you fixed up?
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.880]   >> Well, see, Friday or Saturday was the first day
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.800]   that I went to bed at a certain time.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   It wasn't my usual time, but I went to bed--
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.880]   >> Daytime.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.560]   >> Book up six to eight hours later
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400]   and woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.200]   Now, again, that was three o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.320]   But again, first time in a week and a half.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   And I enjoyed that for all of a day and a half.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160]   And then I had to start working on my iPhone book.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   And so now it's going to be--
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.400]   I could spend the next 30 minutes having lunch
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.800]   or I could get a hot pocket in three minutes
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.400]   and work on the book for another 27.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800]   OK, we'll just work on the book.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   >> Oh, God, you poor fella.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.520]   >> Please, sympathy.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.360]   Keep coming.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.840]   >> Aww, poor Andy.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.240]   I don't know how you do it.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800]   >> I can use this.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400]   Well, today we shall-- we battered few.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.600]   Because I don't think Alex is getting much sleep either
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   with his new baby.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   >> I had a little production actually last week.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.280]   I got to bed at 6 this morning.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.120]   >> 6 AM?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.040]   >> I'm feeling much better now.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.200]   Yeah, we had a little deadline.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.160]   >> Oh, my gosh, I'm not going to complain one bit then.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.200]   >> Holy chemoly.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   >> Oh, you know, 3D.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.640]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.040]   Oh, you're doing a 3D production?
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   >> We just finished one.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.960]   We finished the deadline.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.800]   >> That's the hot thing.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.480]   In fact, isn't there a new movie being made
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.080]   your most of a picture that just announced
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   going to be produced in 3D?
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.520]   >> Oh, no, not 3D video, just like 3D animation.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.360]   >> Oh.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.960]   >> Ah, 3D videos, anything.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.440]   >> 3D video.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.920]   And it's-- I have some--
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.600]   I'm testing some glasses for some 3D glasses.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.800]   >> See, that's my problems.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.160]   I'm never going to want to wear those stupid glasses.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.360]   >> I wonder if this whole 3D thing is just a gimmick
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.240]   to keep people from running DVDs.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.680]   >> I actually really enjoyed it.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.600]   I've got an point now where there's been a hand--
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.840]   I saw up, which wasn't that big of a deal,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.680]   but monsters and aliens, I thought was great in 3D.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.040]   >> You've got to have kids so that you just
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.640]   so you can go to these movies and, you know--
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   >> Right.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.120]   >> --not look like you're me going to the--
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.520]   >> I haven't seen up yet for that reason.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.040]   I don't have kids anymore.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   >> It really is a question of finding a way
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   to keep movies marketing.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.200]   Their-- DreamWorks is so heavy on 3D.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.760]   Or they're investing so much in their future in 3D
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.400]   that they actually had.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.920]   Jeff Katzenberg go off on like a six stop nationwide dog
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.080]   and pony show of not like 1,000 people, but like 100--
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.600]   the-- Katzenberg was in Boston in a screening room with me
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.200]   and maybe like three or four dozen other people,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   just like showing clips from up.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   This was like three or four months earlier.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.880]   And going through like a canned presentation,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.280]   surely, but the fact that the head of the studio
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.520]   would come to see just--
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.800]   >> Oh, they're interested.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.360]   >> That's right.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   And a lot of it is anti-piracy.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.640]   A lot of it is, again, giving people a reason
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.920]   to spend $10 to $20 to go to a movie theater.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   One of the big economic things is that they feel as though
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.000]   that theaters can charge a premium price
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.160]   for digital 3D projection.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.400]   So instead of charging 12 or 13 bucks a ticket,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   maybe they can charge 19, 20 bucks a ticket,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.560]   which will give them a bigger pie to cut up
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.480]   or instead of like the 4% they usually give to the theater,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.760]   it'll be 3% but it'll be 3% of a much larger number.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.800]   Anyway, it's interesting.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.520]   >> Yeah, well, I'm not a 3D fan,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.400]   but let's start talking about max stuff anyway.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.040]   First of all, very serious rumblings now about the tablet.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.520]   >> It's showing up everywhere.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.840]   >> Financial time says September.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   >> I think they're a little optimistic.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.240]   >> Apple Insider says they know for sure,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.760]   because they're hearing it from the same reliable resources
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.240]   that they've heard other stories from,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.160]   that it's going to be first quarter,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.400]   January through March 2010, which might be a little more credible.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.600]   But September, financial time's why.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   I mean, I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.560]   but this is a highly respected journalistic endeavor.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> Okay, citation needed though.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.440]   >> Yeah, well, nobody has a citation.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.480]   They're all saying sources.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   >> Yeah, I mean, sources unknown.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.240]   >> Yeah, I think that if you were to rewind,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   rewind to about a year ago,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.520]   the first time we spoke more than five minutes
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.120]   on the subject of an Apple tablet.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.600]   >> I think, almost.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.120]   >> Which, by the way, you, you Andy,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   were the one who's, I think before anybody said,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.160]   this is what they needed to do.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.600]   >> I'm going to regret it.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.560]   >> I would, that's one of those things that factually,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.800]   I think I could dispute, but professionally,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.080]   I would like to encourage the structure
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.800]   that members knew.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.640]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.400]   >> But no, no, it was really,
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.840]   if you were to rewind to a year ago,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.440]   I'm sure that I think that most of us
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   had the opinion that we're not going to see it in 2009.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   We might see it in late 2009,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   a year after that is more likely.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.880]   It's almost a certainty that Apple's working on something
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   like this, and it wouldn't be a huge tablet,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.960]   it would be something more convenient,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.560]   and we would run the iPhone operating system,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.480]   it wouldn't be a super Newton or miniature Mac.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.040]   Apple Insider is one of the new sites that I respect a lot,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.520]   not only because they tend to get their facts right,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920]   but they are always very transparent
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   about how they feel about this information.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   And that's the sort of story that they put out
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.800]   a few days ago.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.840]   And I think that too many news outlets
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.120]   happen leaping on this as some sort of a big news event,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.760]   as opposed to, you know that thing that we all figured?
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.160]   Well, we've seen nothing to contradict
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.240]   that that original guest might have been wrong.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.320]   I mean, again, I would like that-
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.600]   >> So you're coming down, and I think,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.680]   Alex, you are too, that the first quarter of 2000,
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.280]   is much more credible.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.240]   >> Yeah, I think that's more credible.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.200]   >> We would have had to have seen something at WWDC,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.000]   or something to prime the pump for all the software
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.520]   that this new device is going to have to run.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   And what do we think about the description?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.520]   10-inch, what does it say?
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.960]   It's a 10.4-inch screen.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.880]   >> I think that sounds reasonable.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.120]   >> Seems to be, some are saying,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.280]   we'll not have, financial time said,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.160]   we'll not have phone capability.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.040]   >> That sounds nice.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.480]   >> I guess the question that-
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> You don't think that's credible either?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.680]   >> Oh, no, I think that is credible.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.040]   I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.400]   >> You don't want to hold a bit-
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.280]   Dvorak said.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.760]   >> Oh, great.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.240]   >> No!
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.200]   >> I don't want to hold that-
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.240]   >> People seem to have-
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.560]   >> The problem with that being a phone device is that
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   Apple would not be able to sell it to people
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.440]   without a contract.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.040]   Whereas, I'm sure they want this to be something
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.280]   that everybody will be able to own
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.960]   without having to spend 60 bucks a month,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.840]   or without having to work through their mommy issues with AT&T.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.800]   >> So put Wi-Fi in it,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.920]   should you put 3G network capability in?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.040]   Not phone, but 8-
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.600]   >> Or 4G.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.960]   >> Or 4G?
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.840]   >> I mean, the rumor is the-
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.960]   >> The rumor is the Verizon-
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   >> The rumor is the Verize-
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   >> The rumor is the Verize-
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.400]   >> Yeah, the rumor is the Verize-
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.360]   >> I mean, the parallel rumor is the Verize is trying to get 4G
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.760]   up to speed by the beginning of next year.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.080]   The speeds on 4G are purportedly 60 megabits a second.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.600]   >> That makes that Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.920]   >> You know what, you know what?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   Someone asked me about how fast the Wi-Fi was
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   that I just got this little Wi-Fi.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.440]   >> We all three of us now have a Wi-Fi.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.120]   This is the little credit card size wireless access point
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.240]   that ties into Verizon or Sprint's EVDO system.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.960]   And it really is cool.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.000]   It gives you Wi-Fi.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.960]   Works with your phone.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.600]   >> It's really nice.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   >> Well, and I-
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.880]   But someone was asking me how fast it was.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.960]   And I said, "Oh, it's about the same as DSL."
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.120]   You know, I mean, I'm getting about the same speed as DSL,
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.480]   but of course, I have cable here,
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.240]   and we have a fiber at the office.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   And I've decided that DSL is the new dial-up.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.680]   >> It's not the same speed as DSL.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.040]   You can get much faster DSL on that.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.360]   >> It's 170, 180 on this.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.080]   >> 1.5 megabits is the tippity top.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.560]   >> On this one.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.200]   >> That you could get.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.560]   And I usually don't get anything with it.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.120]   >> You're like, you're like-
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.320]   >> On DSL.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.360]   >> On DSL.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.920]   >> On DSL, you can get much faster.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.560]   >> I'm getting that in my house.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   >> On the-
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.160]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.760]   >> On DSL, I never get more than 1.5.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.200]   >> Oh, well, you just have a crappy DSL.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.560]   >> I don't have DSL anymore.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.640]   It's what I remember DSL.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.040]   >> Let me just check our DSL right here with DSL extreme.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.160]   I would say it's really dependent on the implementation.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.760]   >> I was getting 110 or 120 when I speed tested it.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.080]   >> When you say 110, you mean 110?
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.800]   >> K.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.600]   >> K.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.080]   >> Right.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.480]   >> Which would be 8.8 megabits per second.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.440]   Something like that.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.480]   >> Right.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920]   >> Yeah, you can get faster than that.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.880]   But I would agree that most of the time that's how fast it is.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.360]   >> I mean, to put it in perspective, a T1 is 1.5, right?
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   >> Right.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.280]   >> I mean, it's symmetric.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.560]   >> That's a big difference.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.040]   >> But to get back to the tablet,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.120]   I mean, I could believe that we'll have a 3G or 4G chip set.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.320]   I would believe that it would be possible to add some later date
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.880]   or when you first buy it to buy a contract.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   But if Apple requires you to buy a contract with this device,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.240]   that's instant fail.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.160]   >> But the other side of those is that the upside of that is that the tablet
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.360]   would be a lot less expensive.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.880]   You know, that's what comes with that service.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.280]   I mean, maybe you pay retail if you don't want the service
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   and then you pay if you get the service.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.200]   I have to admit, I want it to be connected all the time.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.440]   I'm quite, if they can sell it to me for $5.99 with the service
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.400]   and I know that I can just open that thing up and be connected,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.480]   you know, that's something that's very compelling to me.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.120]   >> That would see that actually that would be a downer for me.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.440]   I would really, especially since now,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.560]   now I'm paying for internet connectivity for my iPhone.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.200]   That's a no-brainer.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.480]   That's an obvious thing.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.920]   And now I'm paying a monthly nut for the MyFi.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.480]   Also, given the range of features that the MyFi gives me,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.800]   also a no-brainer, I'm not going to add a third contract
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.080]   for a third means of accessing the internet just to serve this one tablet.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.320]   I would be more likely to simply say, "Look, I got a MyFi.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.800]   I don't need this extra $40 a month."
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.600]   >> Maybe they'll look at that as being the way they go.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.120]   >> They're the very worst Apple.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.040]   I mean, you've already sold me an iPhone.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.360]   Why don't you give me like a Bluetooth tethered
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.680]   exclusively between this device and my iPhone?
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.120]   Why are you trying to come after?
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.520]   Are you going to encourage AT&T,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.320]   which is not the friendliest wolf in the pack,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.960]   to try to take me from the 2030 bucks?
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.360]   >> Well, the question is really, is it going to be AT&T?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.160]   There's no agreement.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.240]   I doubt there's any agreement that Apple has to have the new device on AT&T.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.920]   >> Well, do you think that this is the device Verizon is expecting to get?
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.880]   Because I think it's a good thing.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.040]   >> I think it's a good thing.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.080]   >> Clearly, you know, Verizon CEO, even ATTC,
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.600]   AT&T CEO said this week, "Yeah, we're going to lose exclusivity."
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.440]   >> Well, I think Verizon CEO said this week,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.800]   "Yeah, we're going to get the iPhone."
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   >> It's got to be terrifying for AT&T,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.320]   because I'm going to guess that half to two-thirds of the iPhone users would just move
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.600]   to wherever the iPhone is.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   >> So this quarter, AT&T said they got one point,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.800]   I'm trying to remember the exact number,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   I think it was 1.2 or 1.3 million new customers,
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.480]   of whom two-thirds were iPhone purchasers,
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.040]   i.e. those new customers came for the iPhone.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.440]   >> Right.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.280]   >> Now Verizon's still growing.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.080]   I think they had 1.1 million new customers this quarter.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.400]   So those numbers may be, they're roughly right.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.280]   So yes, you're right.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.600]   I mean, think how Verizon does with an iPhone.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   >> You know, if they're keeping neck and neck with AT&T without the iPhone.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.840]   >> Well, it really is.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   >> What happens to AT&T?
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.720]   >> I love to poo the whole, you know, the Verizon ads and everything.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.360]   But it's a completely different network,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.280]   and it's much more robust than the AT&T.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.800]   When I was twittering about this and someone-
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.240]   >> People are so unhappy with AT&T.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.920]   You saw that TechCrunch article last week,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.360]   AT&T is a steaming pile of failure.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.720]   We talked a little bit about it.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.400]   There was, that resonated through the interwebs.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.720]   >> Right.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.120]   And someone asked me, I was complaining that I don't get
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.720]   good reception on AT&T, and they asked me,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.000]   where do you not get good reception?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.520]   And I was like in San Francisco.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.240]   [laughter]
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.760]   >> You know, because it's a backwards town,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.640]   and you wouldn't expect anybody to be using technology
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.680]   there.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.520]   >> Well, they started turning off the 3G towers,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.920]   actually got to the 6G network in San Francisco.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.640]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.960]   >> Do you think AT&T, another story that we're going to,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.480]   well, we might as well talk about it right now,
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.080]   we don't, we'll jump around a little bit,
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.600]   we might get back to this table story.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.160]   But of course, the Google Voice apps,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.360]   which Google had written.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.760]   >> So I have to admit, it's the first time I've been upset.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.520]   >> Was turned about all these apps, these apps.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.640]   >> This one you're pissed off about.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   >> Ah, I love Google.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.640]   >> And do you think AT&T had something to do with that?
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.440]   >> Of course they did.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.360]   >> I think Apple doesn't care.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.400]   >> Well, technically, here's the question that,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.640]   that camp when I saw the article, it was,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.240]   you know, technically Apple turned it down because it duplicated other features,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.600]   which they've turned down for other.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   >> Yes, that's their, that's their terms of service.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.000]   >> But sort of Skype.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.920]   >> Right, and Skype's on there.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.640]   >> Right.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.400]   >> So the Google Voice app required Wi-Fi,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.440]   did not work on 3G?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.880]   >> Uh, I don't know if the Google, if it required.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.920]   >> I mean, I could see they'd turn it down if it worked on 3G.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.720]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   >> Now the test that I, that I still haven't done,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.680]   hey, I don't know if Andy has done this, is using Skype's Wi-Fi.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.360]   >> Why do I go through the Wi-Fi?
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.680]   >> Right.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.960]   >> That's what I did.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.240]   And then I'm using Verizon.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.680]   I'm amazed that this works.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.520]   I'm using Verizon to play Skype calls on my AT&T phone and it works great.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.360]   >> It's too clear.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.440]   >> It did have free SMS messages.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.600]   >> Right.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.120]   I don't know if that's something that Skype has,
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.040]   but that could have been part of the problem.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.240]   >> Well, I don't, I try not to, I try to discourage people from wanting to talk to me
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.960]   on the phone anyway.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.920]   I don't know why I would do that and make it more complicated to do and initiate the call.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.800]   But I'd like to say, I really,
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.360]   >> That's true.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.480]   >> Because you have to, to make a call with Google Voice is a kind of complicated process.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.600]   You don't just dial a call.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.520]   >> Well, I mean, also--
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.560]   >> It calls you, right?
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.440]   >> Doesn't that how it works?
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.080]   >> Well, I mean, the biggest deal with Google Voice is,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.040]   is basically network independence, being able to essentially--
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.960]   >> Yeah, I'm a big Google Voice fan, yeah.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.920]   Virtually, virtually route any means of communication through any phone number that you want and be
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.040]   essentially your own switchboard.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:28.440]   I really need to, I'm very sympathetic with all the outrage that's being funneled out over
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.960]   banning Google Voice.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   I really want to know the reasons why, as opposed to guessing that all AT&T slammed
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.280]   Sam Bapple or Apple's contract with AT&T for some not to do that.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.560]   >> We'll never know, will we?
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   >> Or was an Apple store, excuse me, it was an app store thing where duplicated features or,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   I mean, for unfortunately, sometimes it turns out to be a dazzling tale of corporate bastardry.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.680]   Sometimes it seems to be, oh, you know, when we built that networking stack into the OS,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.240]   we didn't anticipate that someone would be switching things this way,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.600]   and it actually causes things to die.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.520]   Could we possibly not approve this?
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.840]   Because it will cause lots of things to die.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.520]   Until it's--
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.280]   >> Well, I mean, one thing we can be sure will not be approved is the Spotify application on the
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.680]   iPhone.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.560]   This is, I mean, talk about a crazy attempt.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.240]   That's the streaming music service.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.000]   A lot of music labels are behind.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.400]   It's--
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.960]   Spotify says it finished the app and has sent it over to the nice people at Apple.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.680]   >> Nice people.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   >> Nice people, please.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.240]   >> No, nice people.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.120]   >> Through nice people.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.080]   I somehow don't think Apple's going to give them the go ahead on this.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.240]   >> You got the impression that this is part of the marketing program for a lot of these services.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.680]   Like just like in the '50s or '60s, the studios would put one really, really bizarre sex scene in a
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.600]   movie just to make sure that they could use it.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.520]   See the movie that was banned in box.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.320]   >> Apple banned it.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.280]   That's how good this is.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.800]   Yeah, because this basically is a subscription, you know, service.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.000]   Although Pandora is similar on the iPhone.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.880]   >> I don't think it's the same.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   I mean, streaming audio is not as compelling for me as my iTunes library.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.280]   >> Right.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:08.840]   >> It's not even--
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.200]   >> It's not on the same ball part.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.280]   And a real subscription service lets you download those.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.080]   >> Right.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.240]   >> Right.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.720]   >> You're all fine.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.360]   >> Remember, the Pandora does not let you make requests.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   You name a song at the starting point, but then it simply selects songs that are similar to it.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.600]   If you want to hear Octopus's Garden, if that was the first thing you ask for,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.800]   you're going to get it maybe.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.400]   But usually it'll just give you a stream of things or '60s trippy head music.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.920]   >> Do you really want to hear Octopus's Garden?
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.160]   I mean--
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:39.960]   >> Only if it's the version from the 1976 BG's movie, "Star du Pareval."
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.600]   That's different.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.880]   >> Oh, it's long to be--
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.280]   >> Make sure you don't play the good one for the actual--
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.360]   >> On to the scene.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.000]   >> It's like, "Ringo had to have one hit."
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.560]   >> I'd like to be under the scene.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.320]   >> What'd you get?
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.480]   Diamond and Catwester out here to really keep that right.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.520]   >> It's really good.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.200]   >> Oof.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.880]   >> I'll show you.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.920]   Other stories.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.880]   Are we done with the tablet?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.840]   We're excited about the tablet.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.440]   We believe it to be true.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.880]   We think it's going to happen first quarter, 2010.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.360]   10-inch screen, touch screen, Wi-Fi.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:19.000]   We debated a little bit over the inclusion of forced EVDO wireless.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.280]   >> The only point that I would make in favor of a touch screen in 2009 is that,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.640]   that would be a brilliant consumer item.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.760]   And Apple always does that special event in September to show off the new iPods or the new--
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.680]   please, the new stocking stuffer products that they're putting out.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   So it's not a time when they would release a phone.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.080]   It's not a time when they would release a computer,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.600]   but it would be a time that they would release what they would term a media tablet.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.360]   So that's a possibility.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:52.040]   But again, I would be so shocked if they simply released this tablet without saying,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.160]   "Oh, and here are 500 applications that are already available for it."
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.920]   >> Now, do we think that one of the big questions people have had is,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.040]   what are we expecting as far as a keyboard?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.600]   My opinion has been, if I can have a Bluetooth,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.040]   separate keyboard that I can fold up and everything else,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.160]   I mean, this becomes 60% of my carrying around computer.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.560]   >> Right.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.360]   >> I mean, I sit in seminars now and take notes on my iPhone.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.080]   >> Look at the mockup, the great mockup that was at Apple Insider had,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.120]   which had a nice big--
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.520]   I mean, if you got a 10 screen, you could pretty much do a decent touch screen on screen keyboard.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.000]   >> I think.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.600]   >> I don't know if I could write a whole article on it.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.880]   >> Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.400]   >> Well, would Apple even want you to write a whole article on it?
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.440]   >> I mean, it's--
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.040]   >> Yes, and we certainly wouldn't want to do anything Apple doesn't want us to do.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.400]   >> Well, I mean, given that--
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.720]   yeah, again, this said to the thing,
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.520]   "Are there two or three people in this conversation that have manipulated netbooks to run macOS?"
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.760]   >> So, we're at least two.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.560]   I don't know if there's three.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.040]   >> We're not three.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.120]   >> If you say three, that incriminates us all.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.720]   If you say two out of three, they don't know who to go after.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.400]   >> Realize you're the only person who used the word "us"
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.000]   implying that you were one of the three.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.800]   >> We're all just--
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.320]   >> So, essentially, it's either--
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.720]   >> Actually, Colleen did it on Revision 3's "Texilla Show."
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   >> And not in this-- it never entered--
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.240]   >> Well, she did--
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.400]   >> Well--
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.000]   >> Was billed as an employee of Twitter.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.120]   >> I think I'm going to--
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.680]   >> Well, just for the record,
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.000]   although I have stated before that I've done this,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.720]   it was during the cruise we were in international waters.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.240]   >> [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   >> And before we came back to Chinese immigration,
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.840]   I set fire to it and threw it overboard.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.640]   >> Good, man.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.840]   >> Apple, you have no reason to be upset in any way.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.680]   But keep in mind that we have--
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.000]   that Apple sells a $1,000 notebook,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   and that if they were to sell a $500 machine
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.600]   that would cost people to give Apple $500 less
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.360]   in their consumer dollars,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.240]   you know, that might be an issue that for Apple to consider.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.880]   They would probably couch it not incorrectly in terms of,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.840]   "Well, we don't-- we can't make a virtual--
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.000]   virtual touch-type of a keyboard that people will--
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.320]   that Apple or the consumer will be happy with."
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.720]   And that's not really what they've phoned--
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.480]   what this OS was designed to do well.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   I mean, but I'm with you, Alex.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.560]   I would be very, very happy and very, very satisfied
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.640]   if I simply had the ability to get a folding Bluetooth keyboard
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.480]   that I would only take with me on those times
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.320]   when, "Look, it's a three-day-- it's a long weekend.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.600]   I don't want a real computer with me,
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.200]   but I do want to have my tunes.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.880]   I do want to have something Mac-like with me."
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.480]   >> Well, I think my issue is that I--
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.440]   you know, I don't-- I don't route all of my email,
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.880]   for instance, to my iPhone,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.640]   mostly because I get about--
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.280]   I get about 400 emails a day and about 250 of them
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.200]   are something that I have to actually see,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.880]   you know, and about-- I respond to probably 150 of them a day.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.280]   And doing that on a touch screen would be,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   you know, an unfortunate experience, I think.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.600]   I'm already pretty--
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.840]   >> Yeah, I've tried to do emails on my iPhone
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.880]   and I-- well, I do do it.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.440]   It's not fun.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.680]   >> And so the thing is, is me having to be able to--
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.240]   and this is really what I-- you know, I think that the screen--
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.600]   I mean, I think the tablet--
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.640]   and when Andy was first talking about this years ago,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.520]   we were in the process--
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.720]   I was sitting there watching the whole thing,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.640]   because we were in the process of trying to develop a tablet.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.280]   You know, much--
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.240]   >> Right, I remember that.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.880]   >> And--
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.040]   >> And tech crunch has done it.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.080]   >> Well, they're almost done it.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.920]   And the--
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.920]   >> They're going to come out right about the same time as apples.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.480]   >> Well, but--
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.280]   >> But here's the thing--
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:14.760]   >> I don't think--
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.640]   >> That's just a browser.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.680]   >> I don't think that they're going to--
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.720]   I don't think those are competitive--
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.160]   >> Really?
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:19.960]   >> Products.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.640]   There's going to be a hat,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.560]   at least half the price of the Apple version.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.080]   So I think there's going to be a whole group of people,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.120]   especially people who watch tech--
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.720]   who go to tech crunch.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.600]   You know, it's a different--
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.920]   I think it's a different clientele.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.880]   You know, and I think that they're--
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   I think they could be very successful with their--
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.600]   >> They could sell hundreds.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.680]   [laughs]
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.880]   >> Well, no, they're--
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.320]   it's a brilliant product,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.200]   because it's just--
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.000]   it is 100%, it is 95% concept.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.640]   It is--
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.280]   look, we do--
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.520]   we can do everything through a web browser.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:48.680]   >> Right.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.280]   >> Let's just do a tablet that does nothing,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.040]   but run a world-class browser,
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.200]   and we will let all apps basically navigate
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.280]   their way through the browser.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.200]   And so that's a really brilliant idea.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.360]   It also allows them to save a lot of money in the build.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.000]   It also essentially allows them to have a long--
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.600]   with the tech crunch community.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.960]   They're having a long conversation
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.720]   to make sure that they are essentially
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.960]   almost custom-building the--
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.280]   >> Right.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:10.760]   >> The price that--
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.440]   >> More than you know, the audience.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.320]   >> And I would love to--
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.160]   I think it will be a very, very important product
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.760]   in terms of it will--
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.360]   you'll have like maybe 5,000,
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.480]   maybe even 10,000 people with these crunch pads.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.040]   And then that will show Apple,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.640]   and we'll show all these other manufacturers.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.080]   Does this work?
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.960]   How to make this happy--
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.040]   how to make a broader audience happy with it?
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.720]   I really can't wait to get my hands on one,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.480]   because I really want to see how well this works
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.040]   just as a browser with a life support system attached.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   >> Yeah, and so I think that--
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.400]   I think that they're going down the right path,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.640]   although I do think that the big game is going to be--
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.320]   I think the tablet is revolutionary.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.040]   I know that some people think,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.640]   "What am I going to do with this bigger tablet?"
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.560]   But I think it becomes an interface to everything.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.040]   I mean, I think it's something that you use that--
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.840]   and I think that companies are going to build ways
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.760]   to interface your home security, your lighting,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:04.280]   your refrigerator, your car, all those things.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.320]   Like if I had this tablet,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.240]   I would love to pull the GPS out of my car,
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.480]   pop the tablet in, have it be my GPS,
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   have it be my interface to my car,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.240]   have maybe get an SDK from my home.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.960]   >> I have something like that.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   The clarion mind, clarion's the thing.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.600]   It's a GPS with Wi-Fi built into it.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.640]   You get the weather and stuff,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   and it's great.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.560]   It's got social networking built in.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.000]   Direct connect to MySpace.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.040]   I am so happy.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.280]   I'm going to create a MySpace account just to use it.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   >> But when you're driving,
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.960]   can you really read that like white warrior font
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.200]   on back to the purple X-Men background?
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.920]   >> I think that everyone's missing the point
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.400]   that that interface makes a huge difference.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.000]   >> I think Apple spends more time on that than anyone else.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.360]   >> Well, it's interesting because Microsoft
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.360]   pushed this five years ago, like crazy.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.200]   You really thought everybody was going to go in this direction,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.800]   and it just kind of flopped.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.760]   It's got to drive Bill Gates,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.960]   because that was his pet project,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.440]   crazy to see all this talk now about tablets.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.000]   >> Right.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.880]   >> I thought of that.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.600]   I thought of that.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.000]   >> They did it in exactly the same way
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.920]   that almost every tablet manufacturer,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.280]   with the exception of Apple has done it,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.160]   they've started off with,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.560]   let's make Microsoft Windows,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.040]   and we'll just add a few hooks to make an understand that,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.800]   oh, you're in portrait mode, not landscape mode.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.480]   I mean, I got some of the very first Windows tablet PCs.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.160]   When they had their first big push,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.200]   oh, this is going to revolutionize.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.240]   We're going to sell it to students.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.640]   We're going to sell it to book readers.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.840]   And then I still find myself with a plastic pen in my hand
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.960]   trying really, really hard to tap a closed box
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.160]   on a standard Windows.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.120]   >> Oh, such a pain.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   >> And it was like an operation game.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.960]   It's like remove, wrench, ankle.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.000]   [BEEP]
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.400]   No, wait.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.520]   [BEEP]
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.440]   >> And his perfect face for radio is pointed out in our stick
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:38.920]   M-Chat.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.080]   There was a product before that called the Newton.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.800]   >> Right.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.120]   >> You know?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.760]   >> I mean, so...
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.440]   >> That's why I said it.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.680]   When Apple decided to make a tablet-type device,
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.440]   they simply said, you know, see this?
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.000]   >> Start from scratch.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.200]   >> But one time I don't have my moleskin or whatever handy,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.720]   but you know, see this notepad?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.680]   Do this only digitally.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:54.920]   >> Right.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.440]   >> And for, I mean, those, if I had come up with like 10
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.120]   moments where I was in a demo and I just had to put whatever
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.160]   it is down and start applauding, it was the first time I had a
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.960]   Newton message pad.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.120]   And again, I've always used these paper notebooks.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.440]   And I was just jotted down a note.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.040]   Let's leave the handwriting recognition aside.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.840]   Jotted down a note.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.560]   And then just by reflex, I did the thing I do every time I
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.720]   handed a note, which is just simply right of line underneath it.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.840]   And then it just flicked for one second, reformatted,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.320]   retex it.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.960]   And I'd accidentally discover that, yes, this is how you tell
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.880]   the Newton, I finished this previous note.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.920]   Please let me start a new one.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.320]   >> Exactly.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.600]   >> I'm like, oh, boy, you guys actually thought it before you
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.960]   actually built this, didn't you?
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.000]   >> Well, and I think that that, I think one of the things about
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.840]   the iPhone is that Apple really stopped and built an OS for
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.480]   the iPhone.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.640]   You know, they built, they thought every little bit out,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.920]   they worked out all these little pieces.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.600]   They didn't just try to cobble something together.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.040]   This is exactly what you're talking about here.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.080]   Is that they just, you know, and I think that, you know,
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   everyone, everyone thinks that they're excited about the
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.360]   hardware and they're trying to get the feature set,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   but they're also trying to get into some impossible price
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.240]   point because that's the market they think that that's there.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.520]   And I think that Apple is saying, you know,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.280]   we're going to make it for what we're going to make it for.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.240]   You know, and people will come by it and, you know, I will.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.800]   >> Is the iPhone the perfect tablet on us?
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.320]   Would you make any changes?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:11.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.520]   >> Um, I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.440]   I'm sure the, I'm sure there could be a portrait in Locust.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.960]   Should it be landscape focused?
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.560]   >> Well, it should be independent.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.520]   It should be more about moving objects to where you want them to go.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.960]   Also, I just a couple of days ago, I was thinking that,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.240]   ironically, when Windows 1.0 came out, they decided to dispose of layered windows
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.200]   in terms of tiled windows chiefly as a way to avoid getting sued by Apple.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.880]   And it just occurred to me that we're probably in a mode of
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.800]   development where we need to bring tiled window interfaces back,
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.200]   where I'm going to have a limited amount of screen real estate.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.840]   I want an operating system that intelligently figures out
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.640]   what is the dominant focus thing without covering up or obscuring all these other things.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.520]   I want to keep an eye on.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.840]   >> You know what I think did a good job with that is the Palm Prix.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.280]   I think the pre's, you know, slide the windows around thing metaphor works very well.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.200]   Better than tiling, I think would work for me.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   >> Tiling is kind of what I suppose it does.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.280]   >> Well, it's on a, it's on a, it's on a tiny screen.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   If you had a larger screen.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:12.920]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.960]   >> I mean, imagine, see, the, the ideal that I keep coming back to,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.160]   and maybe I'm just locked into a mindset, but this is something that I wrote up
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:24.360]   as a, one of my last power PC apps like years and years ago,
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.120]   is I love the idea of having that one big status board where you can see your entire world,
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.080]   everything you're interested in at once, where maybe in the very,
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.480]   very center gutter of the screen, you have an actual document window or an actual browser window,
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.640]   but to the left and the right, you have one tile that's telling you,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.400]   here are the last six emails to come in.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.040]   Here's the status of, here are the last 10 twitters.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.480]   Here another tile underneath it.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.960]   Here's another piece of information that you're interested in,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.760]   without having to, you know, alt tab or command tab to, to another application or to
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.400]   command till the, into another window.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.480]   Just, I can make-
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   >> Would it be like the expose that you'd have a button that you push that would bring up the tiles,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   or would they always be on the screen?
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   >> I see it more as a second way of looking at your world.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.960]   Meaning you got a scrivener, my, one of the greatest word processes,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.400]   one of the greatest applications ever.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.560]   Well, it has a mode where it can do exactly that, where it behaves like a normal Macintosh
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.040]   application, but if you put it into full screen mode, you can have it set up so that you have
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.120]   a plane, again, a sheet of paper in front of you to the left, you have like your notes,
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.160]   the right, you have something else.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.400]   >> Right.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.120]   >> I would basically see, see, it's sort of like expose, sort of like spaces,
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.440]   I'm sorry, more like expose or dashboard, where you press a button and suddenly,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   you have basically told each one of these applications that you're running,
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.480]   if it's aware of this special mode, it knows, here is my tiled interface,
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.800]   if I have the focus of the user.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.920]   Here is the tiled interface I'm going to use, if I do not have the focus of the user,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.440]   but the user wants me on the screen.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.880]   So we'll have one version of the application window that sets aside like a regular sort of
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.920]   like vertical window, and you have a second one that's more like a three by five card,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.120]   that can simply be chonked up, down, tiled, left and right.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.560]   >> You don't think Apple might make a push to make the tablet compatible with OS 10,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.520]   so that people don't have to write separate apps for the tablet?
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.720]   >> Well, it will be OS 10.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.080]   >> Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.440]   So since it's OS 10.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.040]   >> Just like I thought, yeah, I don't know if the iPhone really is OS 10.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.000]   You certainly don't write an iPhone app the same way you write an OS 10 app.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.760]   >> Well, it is OS 10.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.320]   That's in a technical sense, that's absolutely true.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.280]   >> Without all the services that you rely on.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.920]   >> Well, that's literally true.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   The iPhone OS is Mac OS with everything that you don't need if you're on a phone instead of a desktop computer.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.720]   >> So that's the question.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:47.800]   When you go to the tablet, do you start adding those core features and then say if you wanted
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.760]   to develop for the tablet, it's just a simple switch and Xcode?
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.040]   >> Well, it would be absolutely just a new Xcode project.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.280]   All the skills that people learn developing iPhone apps.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.080]   >> It is now.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   >> I mean, when you write an iPhone app, it's an Xcode app.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.600]   But I'm saying something that's a little bit closer to a desktop app.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.800]   >> See, I think it would be an iPhone development with more real estate.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.320]   I mean, I think that's the direction.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.000]   That's more of the direction that they're going to go.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.400]   >> Okay.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:11.960]   >> Rather than-
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.600]   >> That's my question.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.680]   You go up from the iPhone or down from the desktop.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.160]   >> I think you go off from the iPhone.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   I think it's going to be an iPhone at its core, not a Mac as its core.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.320]   And it's going to be a more powerful iPhone.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.080]   By the way, I think I tweeted this last night.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.720]   I suddenly, we were talking two o'clock in the morning.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.800]   I realized that we're about rendering.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.360]   And we were joking that we just needed one more rendering thing.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.960]   And I was thinking, my iPhone is twice as fast as the Mac that I rendered Star Wars shots on.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.120]   >> You mean, it's pretty amazing.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   >> These things have a lot of power.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.880]   >> They're getting faster.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   >> But I think we're probably looking at something that is a big iPhone, not a small Mac.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.600]   >> Okay.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.080]   >> That's my-
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.640]   >> Do you agree, Andy?
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.320]   >> Definitely.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.240]   It's definitely going to be an outpour, an extension of iPhone OS.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.760]   >> So the success-
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.120]   >> I wouldn't be surprised if Apple started calling this the Touch OS.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.320]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.120]   I mean, that's what I was thinking.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.840]   >> The success of the iPod Touch might indicate that this is where you go.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.560]   >> The biggest question and the biggest surprise will be,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.440]   how do they answer the question of having a display-
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.800]   using the same toolkit and the same operating system.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.920]   But now applications cannot count on a fixed size or fixed orientation.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.000]   And how will they handle multitasking?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.760]   Will it still be, even though it's a big screen,
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.960]   will it still be one application dominates this big screen at one time?
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.000]   Or will it be a way to simply accommodate certain other applications
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.200]   sharing the same real estate?
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   I have no idea how they're going to do that.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.080]   Again, tiling, it seems to be a good way of doing that.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.760]   The way that the Palm pre does it, I don't think it's insanely,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.040]   intensely spectacular, celestially perfect.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.480]   I think it's very, very good.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.520]   But I think they would have to come up with something brand new and really interesting
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.320]   in order to really take advantage of that big screen real straight.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.200]   It would stink if all we were able to do is see an iPhone application only with bigger text
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.320]   and be able to watch purchased content from iTunes and HD.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.920]   Right. That's the who cares.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:02.600]   Apple still have the horses to do this kind of really good UI development.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.720]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.120]   These guys are still there and they're still.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.200]   Well, I think, as I said, if you're looking at a big iPhone, a big iPhone,
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.480]   I think they definitely have the resources.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.560]   I mean, that's where they're spending all the resources right now.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.360]   It would explain kind of why everything slowed down a little bit.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.040]   You know, they've got Snow Leopard, but that's not a huge development job.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.240]   No, you don't do your life stuff.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.320]   I think Snow Leopard was a massive.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:23.800]   Wasn't.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   But under the hood, not UI-wise.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Not UI-wise, but I think that-
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.320]   Maybe those UI guys are all over in the iPhone division working on the tablet.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.400]   It sounds like a lot of energy is going towards the iPhone.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.120]   Well, if you look at quarterly results, which you're going to do in just a second,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.560]   that would make sense.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.840]   But we'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.360]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.920]   Gentlemen, go to your corners.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.480]   You may have the surgeons take a look at your wounds.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.320]   And we're going to come back in the 60 seconds with more Mac Break Weekly with Andy Inaco,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.120]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.840]   Andy wasn't here last week, by the way, because he slept through the show,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.880]   which was my suspicion.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.920]   Indeed.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.560]   Indeed.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.200]   Well, I was-
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.080]   Again, one of these tiled interfaces.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.200]   I see cards in front of me right now with four different witty rejoinders that remark.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.240]   I'm going to let folks all the-
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.800]   Pick one.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.280]   Pick one.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.000]   Hey, there's no one more sympathetic than I for that.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.040]   It's always been my feeling that I'm here to reflect the interest of the listener.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.120]   So I was simply in tune with the reaction.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:22.680]   Hey!
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.320]   He sent me a note saying, "What was it that happened?
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.960]   You just wanted to close your eyes for a minute."
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:33.640]   I wasn't home for 48 hours, 36 hours.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.320]   And I was still in-
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.280]   My CPU was definitely under clocked.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.720]   And so I'm like, "Okay, I got to get-
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.440]   The show's going to be in just an hour.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.200]   I really needed knock-off some of these emails.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   I'll just sort of get-
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.080]   recharge my battery.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.240]   It's all line bed while I look at these emails."
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.760]   And then looking into those four hours later.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.800]   I completely knew that that's what happened.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:59.240]   The thing is though, I bought this really awesome, cool new clock in Japan.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.080]   This is a thing of beauty.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.120]   I'm very, very pleased with it.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.520]   Of course, I look over and I think, "Oh, damn it.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.960]   This clock is like-
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.000]   It's just two days old.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.640]   It's all ready.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.360]   Oh, damn it.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.000]   Oh, wait.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.240]   No.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.840]   It's actually-
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   It's actually-
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.040]   It's actually about 3-15 in the afternoon.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.840]   All right.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.160]   All right.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.640]   Talk a little bit about my friends at Citrix.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.600]   They do the great product you're seeing on the screen right now.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.160]   And you're thinking in your head at home, I know go to meeting.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.040]   Meetings are the lifeblood of most businesses,
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.800]   but they can kill your company's profits.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.040]   Those airfare, it's so expensive now to fly anywhere,
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.400]   especially business.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.360]   Last minute, the flight, they really gouge you, don't they?
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.880]   Even driving across town with a cost of gas is back up over three bucks again.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.440]   Go to meeting.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   It gives you meetings that are as every bit as engaging and as effective.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.960]   I would submit even more engaging than in-person meetings.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.440]   It's very easy to set up.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.320]   I want you to, in fact, you can go right now to gotomeeting.com.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.480]   Let's put it up here on the screen.

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.520]   There it is.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:08.200]   Slash Macbreak, G-O-T-O meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.360]   Now, why they have this lovely young girl there
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.160]   instead of a picture of Andy and I, go, "I have no idea.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.520]   I'm going to have to work on them."
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.120]   But what you'll do is you set up your account,
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.000]   you click download or continue, I guess,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.160]   and in a couple of minutes, you've got it working on your system.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.360]   Now, you could start a meeting anytime you want,

[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.040]   I'd like to show you the PowerPoint or the keynote works with Macs too."
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.920]   Yes, of course it does.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   So here's what you do.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.600]   Go to gotomeeting.com, click join a meeting.

[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.080]   It's great for training, for collaboration.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.160]   Any kind of conference call becomes more visual, more engaging.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.680]   And really, that's the point of go to meeting.

[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.800]   that's as many meetings as you can hold.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.680]   As long as you want, it's unlimited.

[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.400]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.080]   I got to show you guys, I got to show you Waz did a TV commercial.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.720]   Did you see this?
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.600]   For a body shop.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.560]   Body shop.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.520]   For a body shop.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.400]   Look at this Waz and his-
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.360]   Steve Waz and his-
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.160]   Computer Genius, legendary entrepreneur, and pretty good dancer.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.520]   At Steven's Creek Toyota to pick up his new restore, Prius.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.200]   Hi Steve, how does it look?
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.720]   I buy all my Prius's here at Steven's Creek Toyota for a great price.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.480]   And when he dings him, at Car West Auto Body, we make him look nice.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.840]   When you want the best Car West Auto Body.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.720]   It's a 10.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.280]   10.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.000]   A 10.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.760]   You want it to look pretty.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.800]   How'd they get him to do that?
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.160]   He's pretty easy going, so I'm probably just asked.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.640]   They-
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.120]   All you got to do with Waz is ask, that's really the truth.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.600]   I said it.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:02.920]   Either it-
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.320]   Almost anything that Steve does,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.720]   you see they're out of a sense of fun or a sense of generosity.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.640]   So I'm guessing one or both of those things.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.680]   He might know the guy.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:16.520]   Although they really missed a trick for your basic like cheap local car commercial.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.880]   It should have been Steve Wazniak.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.680]   What are you doing here in Dayton, Sullivan, and Tyre.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.120]   It was pretty close to that.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.000]   Well Bob, you know that I'm famous for hacking.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.120]   And I want to see-
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.520]   Get some lessons because you're an expert at hacking high dealership cars.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.040]   Hey, wow, you're right, Andy.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.400]   They really did miss a bet.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.200]   [laughter]
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.560]   So I announced that part of my business is now ad copywriting.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.440]   You can have really lame locally produced commercials
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.720]   that meet every low expectations of any discount furniture chain in your region or area.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.840]   Oh my goodness.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.360]   Wow.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.640]   Well good for you Steve.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.960]   And return my calls please because he's not answering my calls.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.480]   And I want to get him on the show.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:01.960]   You're great.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.920]   Oh well, you know, well, you know, maybe you missed one trick.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.720]   You know, there's probably like, you know, 200 bucks is 200 bucks,
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.600]   especially in this economy.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.400]   [laughter]
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.600]   I can't figure out.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.640]   Send him a loan.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   You think he left that lot without a free set of like seat covers or floor mats?
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.120]   There you go.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.840]   I interviewed him.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.600]   We had him on the show just when he was just beginning dancing with his stars.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.280]   But I wanted to talk to him right after.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:22.440]   Right.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.600]   And I can't- he's not responding back.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.080]   But I think there's some sort of email thing because he keeps saying,
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.320]   "I can't hear you."
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:29.480]   What?
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.120]   So there's something going on.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.160]   Anyway, Steve-
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.600]   damn lotus notes.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.080]   Forget Stephen's Creek, whatever.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.600]   Think of us next time, okay?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.160]   Maybe just send him a letter care of that dealership.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:41.800]   Yeah, really.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.200]   So the results are in,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.840]   Apple did not have a great quarter, but then no one did.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:57.320]   In fact, Microsoft had lost money for the first time in its history for the year 2009 or whatever it was.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.600]   So, you know, nobody had a great quarter.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:07.800]   But Apple's quarter had some bright spots chiefly the iPhone and the iPod Touch.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.000]   iPod sales down and max sales down.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.160]   iPhone sales.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.800]   Up.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.160]   Up, up, up.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.680]   And iPod Touch too.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.320]   Do you think people just aren't buying the regular iPods anymore?
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.360]   I mean, they're clearly they're not.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.000]   What's the story?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.040]   Takes all the fun out of it.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.600]   I mean, now that you have an iPhone, or once you look at the iPhone,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.680]   I mean, you're like, the only reason the only iPhone iPod that I've bought
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.360]   since the iPhone came out was I got one of the classics.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.160]   Because just because it holds every song that I own.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.120]   So that's like the units 160 gig.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.080]   I don't even know if they make it anymore.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.760]   It's 160 gig classic.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.640]   And it just has my wife and I have our entire library on there.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.960]   And then what we do is when we're traveling, we just throw that in the car and we're able to,
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.480]   you know, find whatever we want to listen to.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.040]   But that's the only reason to buy one in my opinion.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.480]   The iPhone really, really did boost the Apple results.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.320]   I mean, it had strong results overall.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.440]   I'm just putting a break it down.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.800]   It wasn't as good for the iMac.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.320]   But net profits of $1.23 billion for the third quarter.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.280]   Which is kind of amazing giving this economy.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:20.760]   Sales are up for a factor of seven, passing the 5.2 million mark for the iPhone,
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.440]   5.2 million iPhones in three months.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.720]   It is a huge runaway hit.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.880]   I think is it saturation for the iPod or is it the people when they buy new ones or buy on a
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.840]   touch or iPhone?
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.640]   I think that the iPod is starting to move into the realm of being the
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.240]   the kids Apple device and the exercise Apple device.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.920]   Because again, when you when you get an iPod, when you can get an iPod touch for not that much more
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:55.080]   expensive than even an iPod nano these days, that's a big, big decision point to make.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.960]   All the things that this little PDA will do for you that that that a nano won't.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.560]   It's again for parents who want to give them something, give the kids something they're not
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.600]   going to get in trouble with, i.e. no Wi-Fi, no web browser, and something that you want to be able to
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:15.400]   I understand that when people do this thing called exercise, they are actually energetically
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.440]   moving in such a manner that having a heavy device on their own.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:24.760]   I'm saying just put it in your laptop bag as you run, I don't know.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:32.600]   By the way, I think that's also another big thing for me with a tablet is that
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.560]   the one problem I had when I was doing biking at the gym was that this,
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.040]   that the iPhone was just too small when it was sitting, you know, in front of me.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.680]   If I had a tablet, I'd be taken to the gym.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.560]   Oh, yeah, the trist. My gym is at my house now.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.800]   You mean I'm like the stairmaster you'd say?
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.400]   Yeah, like on the stairmaster or on a, it's just the screen if it was just a little bigger.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.960]   The other thing they're going to need to make is Velcro that you can hook right onto the back
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.560]   of a plane, plane seat.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:01.480]   So I just put up there and watch my own movie instead of 17 again, which was inflicted on
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.240]   me in the last flight from Chicago on the rifle movie.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:09.160]   Apple's stock price, Apple's showing once again that it knows how to manipulate the market of the
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.320]   the analyst thought it'll be a buck 17 a share was a buck 35 a share.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.040]   It's always good to do it.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.920]   So the stock price went up.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.880]   Stock price goes up.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.120]   The fact this month, Apple had a low of 137 bucks.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.280]   It's currently at 159.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.640]   It got as high as 174.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.600]   So it's had a very, if you bought Apple stock in July, really July, you did well.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:35.880]   Not that we're recommending or that we own any Apple stock, but we're not allowed to.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.320]   So a very good quarter.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.280]   One thing I thought was interesting.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:38.760]   I don't know.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.960]   This is an analyst's report.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:47.240]   This is not from Apple, but NPD said that 91% of the computers sold costing a thousand or more,
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.840]   91% went to Apple.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.680]   They totally own the, you know, it's funny.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.440]   They say the premium computer market, but $1,000 and up, that's premium.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.080]   That's yeah.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.520]   They pretty much own everything, but the net books is, I guess what they're saying,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.720]   they're really cheap desktop.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.160]   So and that puts an incredible squeeze on these on these laptop companies.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.240]   There's no money in in net books.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.280]   All the market goes to Apple and this is why Apple is happy.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.400]   They're not doing an book because they say what we own this market.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:13.880]   Right.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.080]   And we're making lots of money.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.920]   And I think you see that anecdotally at an airport, man, it's just, it is an incredible
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.560]   sea often times.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:21.880]   Interesting.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.600]   It's a max.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.320]   I'm seeing more and more Mac laptops everywhere I go.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.600]   That's a success.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.160]   Now again, I don't think that the, I have to get them, I'm trying to find the Mac
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.640]   sales owners, but I don't think they were up.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.080]   I don't even mean this as a joke.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.440]   How does it change our perceptions when we were no longer the hot blonde hammer
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.080]   throwing chicken in the workout gear throwing the hammer?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.360]   And now we are the old guy.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:48.600]   Well, sometimes when you see Apple turning those apps down, when you see Apple turning those
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.720]   apps down and enforcing and forcing all kinds of stuff, you wonder.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.680]   Hard, big brother.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.000]   Sometimes you wonder what who's the, who's the chick now?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.320]   Who is the chick now?
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.160]   Who is the, who's the disruptor?
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.120]   Who's going to throw the hammer at the screen with Steve Jobs spouting off?
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That's going to be open source.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.040]   I think you're right.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   Because they have, they have the right.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.960]   But that's like, that's like a chip, just a chick just throwing the camera every different.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.760]   Yeah, Chrome OS.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.800]   What about Chrome OS?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.200]   Probably not.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.800]   It looks like Google.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:23.080]   Google is in an interesting position in that they, I think they have both the greatest
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.200]   amount of imagination and the least amount of imagination.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.720]   And I think that their big problem is that line in their mission state, and that says,
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.440]   do no evil.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:35.720]   Sometimes you do have to do things that may not work out very well because you're being so ambitious
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.480]   and you have such grand plans for everything.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.760]   They can't just simply say, we're going to put out this service.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.520]   We're going to make the entire, all the APIs and all the standards absolutely free.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.960]   Whatever you guys do with it.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.400]   Hey, it's cool with us.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.000]   You need some guy to say, we are building the operating system and because the hard,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.920]   we do have not found hardware that's good enough to run it.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.120]   We built our own hardware.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.440]   And because we don't think that the development environment is good enough,
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   we develop, we built our own development environment.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.720]   And because we don't want the same crappy applications to blend on our hardware,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.160]   that is infecting every other piece of hardware, we're going to approve every app that lands on
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:07.720]   our machine.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.960]   And then look at what happened.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.960]   Totalitarianism has resulted in Apple, essentially having the biggest success story in hardware
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.680]   and operating systems and software of the past years.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.280]   But do they sleep well at night?
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.480]   I think they do.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.280]   Oh, they...
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.800]   The mattress gets a little lumpy with all those bundles of $100 bills.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.520]   But you know what?
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.960]   That's a problem that we like to have.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:35.000]   I hate to defend them though because I mean, I really, I think this is one of the kind of the
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.800]   general issues.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.880]   And this happens, I guess, any company that gets successful is...
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.240]   You're right.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.960]   They used to be the company that was challenging the status quo.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.400]   Now, they is the status quo.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:45.640]   Right.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:51.560]   Well, and I think that I don't know how well Apple does if it gets to a point where it's 15, 20,
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.120]   or more and more.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.480]   Well, market share's going down.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.200]   That's the good news.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.240]   It's good for us.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:55.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.600]   I gotta keep...
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.400]   The call is hungry.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.360]   I gotta keep it hungry.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:58.840]   I don't even think Apple...
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.320]   I'll be honest, I don't think Apple cares if market share is going down.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.440]   As long as margins are up and profits are up, they are in the sweet spot of the market.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.000]   They don't...
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.040]   And there are disadvantages to becoming 15% or 20% as you were about to say.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.840]   I cut you off.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:19.000]   Well, I just think that number one is I think that Steve is a bit rougher than Bill Gates.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.200]   If Steve had 50% of the market or a large portion of the market,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.640]   he would cause far more trouble.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.840]   Sometimes than Bill Gates, we'd be...
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.200]   2.6 million max sold this quarter versus 68 million PCs, a grand age.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.360]   I don't know if that's US or worldwide.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.080]   It must be US.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.600]   But I think Apple gets into antitrust issues.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.240]   I think that Apple gets into...
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.280]   I think it's great to be small.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.320]   I think it's great to be small.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.800]   I think it's...
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.760]   If you're making money...
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   Well, especially if you have a clientele that basically just waits for you to tell them
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.720]   what they should buy next.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.040]   I mean, that's...
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.560]   That's why I oftentimes think that's the big guy and all the people just staring at the screen.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.440]   You know, because...
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:54.920]   Really?
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.320]   Because we're just like...
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.760]   We just wait.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.240]   We just wait.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.440]   What are we buying next?
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.920]   I mean, how many iPhones have we purchased?
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.280]   In two years, three iPhones.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.840]   And how many iPods have we purchased?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.680]   I don't even want to think about that.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.840]   But this says, "unrescored the fact that I'm not buying any more regular iPods.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   It's either a touch or a phone, right?
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.160]   Yeah, I want to be...
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.520]   Now the phone has 32 gigs.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.120]   There's no reason to buy an iPod.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.960]   Agreed, Andy?
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.200]   I would say so.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.640]   Rather...
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.000]   That's a problem for Apple.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.320]   I would turn that around a little bit.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.000]   It's not that there's no reason to buy one.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.840]   It's that your default position is, "I'm going to buy an iPod touch or an iPhone.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.160]   I need to have a reason to go and buy a regular iPod."
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.680]   I definitely think we've seen the death of the hard drive-based iPod classic.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.240]   I mean, it's not without its uses.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.880]   I think it's very, very cool to have 160 gigabytes of stores.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.560]   It also doubles as your media player.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.080]   But given how well the iPhone does at being everything,
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.960]   including, in my case, a four gigabyte flash drive,
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.680]   what's the point of having another thing in your pocket?
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.440]   Well, I bring my iPhone to the gym.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:07.800]   Although I have to say, when it gets sweaty, it doesn't respond well to sweat.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.840]   So I wrap in a towel.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.800]   It's very tight.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.680]   And we have a title.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   And when it gets sweaty, it doesn't respond well.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.800]   Okay, I'm writing that down.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.880]   Doesn't respond well to sweat.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.360]   It doesn't.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   [laughs]
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.320]   And I was really actually glad that the 3GS came out,
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.240]   because my 3G was starting to get a little wonky.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.360]   It was like the start button,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.520]   the home button was getting pressed automatically.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   I think it was a little moisture in there.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.960]   That's all I could think.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.080]   Apple, another rumor.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.280]   Cocktail.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.600]   You've heard this code word, "cocktail."
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.680]   Project Cocktail has Apple, according to many sources,
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.320]   collaborating with EMI Sony Warner Music
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.760]   and Universal Music Group with an eye toward a September launch date.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.000]   This is again, the Financial Times.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.240]   This is not just hardware, though.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.960]   This is perhaps, is it a subscription service?
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.680]   Is it?
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.920]   It sounds like what it actually is.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.240]   It's a way to bundle stuff so that you buy whole albums.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.440]   Yeah, I like it because you get the liner.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.600]   In fact, the New York Times had an article this weekend.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.200]   Whatever happened to album art and liner notes.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.520]   And remember, you used to have this big,
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   what was that, 10 inches of sleeve that you could sit at
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.520]   with your headphones on and listen to the stereo
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.600]   and look at and trip out on the--
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.960]   I still do that anymore.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.840]   Nobody does.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.720]   Kids don't do that.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   They don't even remember that.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.040]   I think this is just someone who's been in the industry
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.960]   too long trying to think of something that would--
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.000]   If we could only have one last ditch ever,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.760]   before we give this whole thing up
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.000]   and just tell everyone to start recording the singles.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.640]   It's not your fault.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.760]   Oh, also, we're going to find out if Paul McCartney is still dead or not.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.120]   He's barefoot, you know, on the cover.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.680]   12 inches, not 10 inches, sorry.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.920]   Thank you, Bollywood.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.200]   You must be an old fart.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.480]   Vinyl, right?
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.200]   Vinyl.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.640]   Have you seen the opening cinematic for the Beatles rock band?
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.320]   It is an absolute utter work of art of just--
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.920]   If you saw that in HD--
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.200]   Is it an album?
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:08.840]   In a movie.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   Yeah, well, it's been out for a couple months now.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.200]   They've got it.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.120]   I'm sorry, no, the game is not out yet,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200]   but they release the opening cinematic,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.280]   which is, again, this beautiful two-minute movie,
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.720]   and also sample game footage.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:24.440]   When I keep hearing about all these ideas,
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.760]   well, we're going to re-package those albums.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.280]   We're going to give album art.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.560]   That's really not the way to do it.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.920]   But wouldn't it be great if,
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.000]   when iTunes is playing a song from an album,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.240]   it had access to-- instead of a static image
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.520]   of here's the cover of the album,
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.760]   it had access to some of this produced content of just--
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.800]   Here's 30 seconds of really interesting, trippy,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.400]   or even just informative, like, screen-saver-e sort of animation,
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.640]   just to make your iMac or just to make your Apple TV
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.520]   or your iPhone look pretty while it's playing the song.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.440]   All right, I will play that for you in a second.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.680]   The Beatles rock band trailer.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.600]   Wow, they actually-- now they do trailers for video games.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.160]   Comes at September 9th, 9.909.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.840]   I'm ready.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.240]   Wow.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:07.640]   I'm ready.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.600]   He's dead.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.240]   He's--
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.800]   Hey, go.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.520]   Smoke and gun.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.640]   You know, we only get these--
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:11.960]   9.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.920]   No, but 9.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.400]   No, but 9.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.000]   You know, we only get these monthly things
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.760]   for another couple of years before we're past it.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.160]   I know.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.240]   This is like the-- you know, everything should launch.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   Now I should launch something 9.909.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.880]   And then next year it'll be 10.10.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.440]   Oh, 10.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.120]   Oh, yeah, we could do that.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.400]   And then 12.12.12.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.520]   But then it's done.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.000]   I know.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.960]   Then it's 13.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.920]   Three more years left.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.840]   Who thought we're screwed for 88 years?
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.360]   So folks, update your iCal,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.360]   because if you want your kid born on a really interesting
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.960]   birthday, you're going to have to plan ahead.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.120]   You know what?
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.600]   I'm saying, I'm saying New Year's Eve.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.280]   Oh, you should have done New Year's Eve.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.720]   If you were--
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.520]   If New Year's Eve was a great time for you,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.720]   you have a chance.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play that video for you
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.520]   just a moment.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.880]   But before we do--
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.320]   Come back to the Jerry Todd show.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.000]   Come back to the Jerry Todd show,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.360]   a little video for the Beatles.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.320]   The Beatles, just the latest band of Mr. Francis video.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.160]   But first--
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:07.880]   It's just a crope.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.120]   That--
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.880]   Where are you going to store all that great video?
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.120]   Huh?
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.480]   I know where on your Drobo.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.760]   Drobo.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.880]   Drobo.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.840]   On your Drobo, Drobo.com/Mac.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.280]   Break Drobo's back, baby, with some great deals
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.600]   on the Drobo and the Drobo Pro.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.840]   Now, let me tell you about the Drobo you've heard me talk about.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.800]   Of course, it's the intelligent automated storage device
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.760]   for your digital storage needs and external hard drive,
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   although born boots from it.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.440]   There's no reason why not.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.520]   If you're running it through Firewire 800.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.080]   Combineds, four hard drives into a single drive of storage
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.520]   accessible right from your desktop.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.000]   With your creative professional,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.600]   they store all those photos, the music.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.320]   A lot of home users have a lot of movies, music, and photos too.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.960]   Small businesses have been using the Drobo too,
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.240]   because of its redundancy.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.440]   You lose one drive, no problem.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.320]   You pop in another one.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.680]   If you want to expand it,
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.640]   take out the smallest drive, put in another bigger drive,
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.160]   and you've expanded the entire Drobo.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.200]   That's cool.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   Even cooler, the Drobo Pro.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.400]   From four discs to eight discs.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.200]   Wow.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.520]   With a new two terabyte drives at 16 terabytes,
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.760]   but they can go up to 256 terabytes of data,
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.200]   as bigger discs become available.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.640]   Now you can lose two drives and still not lose a bit.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.600]   And it's rack-mountable.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.320]   Rack-mountable?
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.400]   It's rack-mountable.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:21.960]   That's good.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.600]   Mr. I'm doing everything on racks.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.760]   You know, Colleen's discovered the virtue of racks.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   We just got new racks for our raids.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.800]   Everything's going to be racked.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.760]   It's kind of an obsession.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.040]   But you're right.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.240]   You'll start looking for it.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.480]   Once you have a rack, we got a new rack at the office.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.000]   And once you have a rack, you just want to put every--
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.440]   Every home user is going to be doing racks.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.640]   Can we cut these things off the matter?
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.880]   It's just a matter of time before they start making racks
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.000]   for home users.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.720]   I swear to God.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.360]   Home racks.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:46.840]   Home rack.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.360]   You're a home-racker.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.240]   Okay. So it's rack-able.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.960]   It's got I, SCSI in addition to Firewire and USB 2 now.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.440]   So that means you can get Gigabit Ethernet there
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.760]   and get very high speed performance.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.120]   Great for virtualization.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.800]   You can use it.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.080]   I know nobody on this show would
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.160]   with Microsoft Small Business Server, but you could.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.880]   And we've got a special deal for you.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.120]   If I look, they even have our album card on it.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.480]   It's so pretty.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.200]   It's so cute.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.160]   Go to macdrobo.com/macbreak.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.680]   When you see this shiny anti-anaco cartoon,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.880]   you will find you can get $50 off a Drobo 2T,
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.400]   4T, or 8T bundle.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.920]   You can get $75 off the Drobo Pro bundle.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.880]   What do they put ears on it?
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.160]   How do they make that rack-able?
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.680]   They just put it.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.040]   Yeah, there's a little ears.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.320]   Yeah, there's a few ears.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:37.880]   I love it.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.800]   Find out all about it.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.320]   It is incredible.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.960]   DROBO.com/macbreak.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.640]   And I'm seeing here for the first time,
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.600]   for a limited time offer,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.680]   enter the instant rebate coupon code MBW save big bucks,
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.360]   but the details are all on the website.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.960]   Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.320]   We love our Drobo's.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.520]   We know you will too.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.000]   And we thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.560]   All right, I got to play this Beatles tribute here.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.960]   Make sure the audio is on.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.840]   Because we wouldn't want to miss it.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.160]   This is probably legal, right?
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.440]   This is probably the only legal way I could play Beatles music on this show.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.000]   Here we go.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.920]   Oh, there's no audio.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.120]   Well, that'll probably make it more legal.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.360]   Well, actually, that's the gameplay trailer.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:24.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.920]   There's another trailer of the cutscene, huh?
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.400]   Why am I--
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.520]   No, no, that's cinematic.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:29.160]   Hang on a second.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.560]   This is on the website, though, right?
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.480]   The Beatles rock band.com.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.720]   There we go.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.760]   I just had to press a button.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.520]   There you go.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.880]   I can't wait to play that.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:50.680]   Oh, that's going to be fun.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.440]   I very much think that, oh damn you, damn you, damn you.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.200]   Now I have to actually buy a game console,
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.800]   because that looks like too much fun.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.520]   Just look at a second.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.160]   I'm at BeatlesRockBand.com, cinematic.php.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.960]   You can get it to it right from the BeatlesRockBand.com.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.120]   I'm actually looking at it because I was checking the URL.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.680]   And it's just-- if they were just an 88-minute concert film
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   of just this sort of movie, this sort of animation,
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.600]   that would be a $10 ticket for me.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.440]   Liverpool, 1963.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.120]   Oh, look at this.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.280]   This looks like almost Disney-like.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.280]   Oh, better.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:35.080]   I was trying to get in touch with the producers of this to find out
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.920]   who directed this, who made this.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   I like this style, though.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.520]   It's kind of 101 Dalmatians.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.760]   And the style keeps changing as they go through the different--
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.720]   Oh, it gets modern.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.600]   Oh, this is awesome.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.560]   It gets very different.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.720]   When they get into the psychedelic age,
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.280]   the animation gets extremely trippy.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.480]   I am the walrus.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.200]   That's the ultimate music video for I am the walrus.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.400]   So this is for Xbox.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.600]   Are they doing a PS3 version?
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.400]   I'm sure they are, yeah.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.680]   I have RockBand and the PS3 not an Xbox.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.960]   Even just like the regular RockBand gameplay.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.360]   Oh, look at this.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.560]   It's very '60s now.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.160]   Yeah, this is their Shea Stadium.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.640]   That's so--
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.760]   See, but I'm impressed.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.240]   They got every little nuance of, you know,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.160]   that Ringo's little like bobble sort of beat when he's playing.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.880]   The way that--
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.680]   Oh, god.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.560]   I'm just so--
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.760]   I'm so--
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.600]   I appreciate this so much.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.640]   How much work went into this to get this so completely right?
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.080]   This is very much a--
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   You like comics, and I can see this is kind of got that same feeling to it,
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.440]   where every cell is thought out and highly illustrated and deep--
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.080]   I mean, money went into this.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.280]   And somebody thought--
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.680]   Or even--
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.160]   Crazy one.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:55.640]   Crazy one.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.560]   I could even match someone saying,
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.680]   normally I would build--
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:02.120]   I would contract this at about 1.1 million.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.600]   I am willing to contribute my own time as a director,
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.080]   because I freaking want this on my reel.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.520]   Well, you have to think--
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.120]   EMI and, you know, the people who own the Beatles publishing,
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.240]   whoever that is these days,
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.200]   have a huge vested interest in the success of this,
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.280]   because this brings the Beatles--
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.880]   We all know RockBand sells music.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.800]   This brings the Beatles back to a young crowd,
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.840]   and maybe sells a whole catalog all over again, you know?
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.880]   So it's worth--
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.840]   Yeah, that's the--
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.960]   That's the sort of thing I'm talking about.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.440]   Like if when you buy an iTunes--
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.240]   or rather when you buy an entire album of music
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.320]   for like four or five songs in here,
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.280]   you get something like this as happening on your iMac screen--
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.560]   Yeah, and wouldn't that be cool?
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.040]   So that would--
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:40.120]   That would--
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:40.600]   That would cocktail.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.560]   That's what cocktail could be.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.720]   That's the sort of thing they should be doing,
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.120]   if they really want to--
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:44.680]   Wow.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.480]   If they really--
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.560]   Well, no, I'm saying if they really want to find a way
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.440]   to entice people to buy albums worth of music,
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.280]   instead of just individual tracks,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.640]   like I so rarely buy an entire album, but this would be--
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.040]   You know what?
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.120]   I only want four or five songs off this album,
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:58.680]   but you know what?
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.640]   I'll pay an extra six bucks to get this extra content.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.760]   Well, my question is,
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.040]   is not only are albums--
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.760]   You know, are they history?
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.880]   Number one, and number two,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.680]   is--
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.440]   Are we--
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.480]   Have we really lost that connection we used to have with bands?
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.080]   You know, we used to have this thing where we were--
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.720]   You know, I was--
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.800]   When I was growing up, I was a huge police fan.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.040]   I had a whole wall, a picture to the police.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.480]   You know, and I listened to all the albums over and over and over again.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.160]   And even now, when I listen to a song,
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.880]   when I get to the end of it,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.040]   I expect to hear the next song on the album.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.560]   But I don't think of bands--
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.200]   I don't have bands that I'm attached to in that way,
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.560]   maybe with my age,
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.160]   but I just don't feel like I'm crazy about bands the way I was back then.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.160]   You know, people feel--
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.960]   You know, music fills the time between the time I'm walking
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.080]   or working out or whatever,
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   but it's not the same obsession that it used to be.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.640]   You know, Nice Fist Films is in the chat room.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.480]   He knows who did this, Peter Candeland,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.080]   who was the Gorillas' animator.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.800]   Ah.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.760]   And that does explain--
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.440]   He had that Gorillas' look to it.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:54.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.920]   That's horrible.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.480]   That's not Peter.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.280]   That's--
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.840]   That's--
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.200]   Mark, what's his name?
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.600]   I forgot.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.240]   No.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.520]   Anyway, thank you.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.640]   Nice Fish Films.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.120]   Yeah, boy, is that nice?
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:06.760]   Nicely done.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.720]   Uh, let's say here.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.480]   I got sidetracked a little bit.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:11.880]   I don't--
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.560]   I don't really like covering this story,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.440]   but I'm going to give you an update,
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.640]   because I know you want us--
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.320]   People are going to want to know what's going on,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.800]   the iPhone worker who committed suicide,
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.720]   at Foxconn.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.600]   Supposedly jumped to his death after being
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.080]   interrogated over a missing iPhone prototype.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.600]   The family has been paid $44,000.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.280]   Um, however, the factory kind of smears this guy's reputation.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.640]   He was 25 years old.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.840]   One of the 16 prototype iPhones,
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.240]   he had ordered from the Foxconn assembly line.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:45.880]   Went missing.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.360]   Family and friends say he was beaten
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.040]   and humiliated by his superiors
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.120]   while being interrogated over the missing phone.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.400]   Foxconn has denied that.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.080]   But this is--
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.760]   There's a lot of controversy over this.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.840]   Son's brother has been talking to the New York Times
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.720]   and said that he got the $44,000 compensation,
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.120]   and they gave Son's girlfriend a free laptop,
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.840]   a free Mac.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:14.440]   You know, he's a young guy, a lot of stress, certainly.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.640]   Um, I can't even imagine, even in the United States,
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.560]   what the stress would be like to be on the factory floor
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   with prototypes of iPhones.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.520]   It's just knowing what Apple's like.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.640]   So, Apple, this is a negative for Apple, I think.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.520]   I don't know.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.040]   I don't know who to blame.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.640]   We don't really know what the story is, unfortunately.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.120]   Exactly.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.560]   I'm encouraged to really tag with us another thing where,
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.000]   "Okay, that's an interesting story.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.000]   I'm going to tag it as an interesting story and nothing more."
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:47.480]   Right.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.760]   It smells a little bit like urban legend.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.800]   I mean--
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.360]   I'm with you.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:52.920]   No, I'm with you.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.200]   The elements, so that's why I really want to be quiet about it.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.280]   And I almost hate to ring it up,
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.200]   but I just thought we should give you an update on that.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:00.840]   That's the latest.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.960]   A hacker has demonstrated that the iPhone encryption
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.880]   is completely worthless, he says, for enterprise.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.200]   He says, "Using freely available software,
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.240]   you can crack the encryption on the 3GS within two minutes,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.080]   allowing access to all the data on the device,
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080]   even photos and emails that have long been deleted."
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.480]   Because you get access to the drive.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:27.160]   This is Jonathan Zdzarski.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.280]   He actually demonstrated this for wired,
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.960]   which is why I give it some credibility.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.640]   They watched as he did it.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.440]   He says the data is just as accessible,
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.360]   and the new iPhone as it was on previous models,
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.560]   which didn't even feature encryption.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.040]   He said it was implemented incorrectly.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.360]   He said, "Once you remove the iPhone's pin lock,
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.800]   which you could do easily,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.080]   then you could back up,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.560]   transfer the entire copy of the drive from the iPhone
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.440]   onto your hard drive,
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.200]   even deleted stuff."
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.240]   If it hasn't been overwritten, I presume.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.200]   He says, "I don't think any of us developers
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.000]   have ever seen encryption implemented so poorly before,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.320]   which is why it's hard to describe why
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.080]   it's such a big threat to security."
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.080]   In other words, if you're using it for enterprise,
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.440]   do not-- if you use it for any reason,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.880]   do not assume that your encryption
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.840]   and your iPhone is, in fact, working.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.960]   It's funny because Jobs was making a big deal
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.200]   about how iPhone security and your enterprise
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.320]   with great security and stuff.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.080]   No response from Apple on this one.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.360]   And I have not seen any information I'm waiting to.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.120]   We talked about it a little bit on security now.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.960]   Charlie Miller, Safari Charlie, the guy who has won,
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.280]   I think twice now, the Pwned-Own contest
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.200]   by cracking the Macintosh,
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:50.280]   says that there's a severe flaw in the iPhone 2.21 software.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.680]   He was not sure if it was available in 3.0
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.120]   that allows you to send a carefully crafted SMS message
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.320]   to the phone and then own it.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.880]   Essentially, take it over, get root access,
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.440]   be able to do anything on the phone that the owner could do,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.200]   including send up more texts, access all the data.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.960]   Now, he was going to reveal that at Black Hat,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.040]   and I haven't seen the details.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.320]   He said that he knew Apple was working on a patch,
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.240]   but what he didn't know, and this is where I think
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.840]   that there's something missing here,
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.680]   what he didn't know is if the hack that he had tried
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.200]   worked on 3.0 or not.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.960]   I suspect the patch was 3.0.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.320]   But I just wanted to warn everybody about that.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.760]   And then you should upgrade.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.240]   Well, you certainly should upgrade to 3.0.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.680]   There's no question about that.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.680]   The question is, are we safe on 3.0?
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.160]   And he talked about it this past weekend at Black Hat,
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.360]   but I haven't yet seen...
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.360]   He said he was going to reveal the technique at Black Hat.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.640]   He had given Apple enough time,
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   and he was going to show how it worked,
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.320]   but I haven't seen any information on this.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.760]   So that's a significant, frankly,
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.920]   a significant flaw if you have this SMS vulnerability,
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.600]   but we haven't heard anything since Black Hat.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.920]   So I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.240]   And we didn't get an update from Apple either,
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.080]   so I have to think that 3.0 is OK.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.560]   But stay tuned for that.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.000]   We'll have more information on that,
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.280]   if there's anything more to say.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.480]   But that is a severe problem.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.320]   And you're going to see these because it's a computer.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.400]   It's a computer system,
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.800]   and these vulnerabilities will be there.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.840]   Final Cut Pro Studio ships ordered my copy.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.600]   You ordered your copy?
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.040]   Burns Blu-ray.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.720]   It does a lot.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.400]   Some people have complained a little bit about Final Cut.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.240]   The Final Cut Studio has not been enough.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.320]   It's not been a big enough upgrade.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.280]   People are expecting huge developments,
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.520]   huge new features, and so on and so forth.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.560]   But I think people have to remember
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   that this has now become a mature app.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.240]   And I think that one of the things about it
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.200]   is that they've really,
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.840]   I think, covered a lot of things that were,
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.240]   I know big issues for us.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.560]   A couple of things with this is ProRes.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.480]   ProRes is the pro-video-resolution codec
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.760]   that a lot of us use as an intermediate codec
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.800]   that we're working with.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.120]   What they've added, which is huge for us,
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.960]   is what they call 4444.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.360]   So in the past, they've had 4222,
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.280]   which was fine for people shooting 4444.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.760]   This is how much compression the video has been applied to the video.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.080]   Exactly. So now I can add an alpha channel to the ProRes.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.640]   I can have a 4444,
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.040]   you know, a full color representation.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.240]   And so that's going to be a big deal for a lot of the stuff that we do,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.760]   because especially if you're adding animation,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.520]   if you have things that have alpha channels like flying logos
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.480]   and stuff like that,
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.000]   the 4444 is going to be a big deal.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.680]   iChat Theater, which we haven't gotten to play with yet,
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.960]   but it looks really exciting,
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.960]   is the ability for using the iChat network
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.200]   to basically share your video screen.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.120]   So you can sit there and talk about an edit
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.400]   and have people look at it and be live going back and forth,
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.240]   which I think is really nifty.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.800]   I think that that's something that's going to be important.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.480]   For us, closed captioning support is important,
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.840]   because that's something we're adding a lot to
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.240]   in the not too distant future.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.080]   Big changes in motion for us.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.240]   These are all the things people complained about in motion.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.600]   So 3D shadows, 3D reflections, depth of field,
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.280]   they had added 3D planes, the ability of a lot of what you see
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.320]   when you're watching TV.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.640]   When the camera on those little promos that go between shows
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.280]   and it's zooming from one person to the next person,
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.800]   they're just shot in front of a green screen
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.920]   without the camera moving at all.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.320]   They put them into a compositing application
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.880]   and they fly a 3D camera at them.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.280]   Now, what makes that really sellable?
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.000]   That's really cool.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.600]   Oh, yeah, and it's used all the time.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.040]   So you do one shot.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.560]   You do one shot of one master shot
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.440]   and then you can zoom around.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.720]   And you can move all around in it.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.680]   And they're on a car.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.160]   You can't move too much back and forth,
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   but you can really do a lot of zooms.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.320]   A lot of what you see are these little 2D cards.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   One of the things that sells them, though,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.640]   is the real 3D space, the 3D shadows,
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.000]   the reflections, the depth of field.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.920]   And that was something that was painfully missing
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.680]   in the last version of motion.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.080]   So that has been added,
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.440]   which I think is going to be really important, as I said.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.480]   So a lot of basic editing stuff in soundtrack.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.080]   One of the big things, one of the problems,
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.200]   Apple bought color.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.280]   And so we're seeing a big change in color
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.560]   as a color management system.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.080]   It lets you really do the fine color timing for film.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.440]   So if you really want to have all the fine details
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.480]   of how you're going to color correct,
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.040]   this is something that can cost a quarter million dollars
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.240]   to do at a big house.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.040]   And they have these huge expensive machines to do it.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.080]   Now, this isn't, you know, this isn't,
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.280]   this isn't, mind me, quite as fast,
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.880]   but it's a, one of the, you know,
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.120]   this is a very powerful tool that was being sold
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.600]   for, I think, $25,000 before Apple bought it.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.240]   Whoa.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:39.800]   And--
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.240]   So I was going to complain about the,
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.480]   what is it, $800 for a File Cut Studio?
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.000]   But hey, I'm going to get a $30,000.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.520]   Well, it came in the last version,
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.200]   but one of the problems was the integration
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.280]   for what Final Cut was painful.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.880]   And so they've really improved a lot of that.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.000]   And so have you played with it yet?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.760]   Or you haven't got to copy it?
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   I have--
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.960]   You have an NFR.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.360]   I got, I ordered it, and it's supposed to come tomorrow
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.240]   if you want to borrow mine.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.040]   I'm waiting for mine to show up.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.440]   So Alex has a paralegal copy of it.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.560]   Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.600]   No, no, I--
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   No, he knows everybody in the Pro Apps.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.040]   I'm sure he has a legitimate copy.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.240]   You have a--
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.360]   There's lots of contracts.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.200]   There's lots of contracts that--
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.640]   You're not allowed to speak.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:20.680]   OK.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.440]   No, it seems like Apple,
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.760]   in the development of the Final Cut Pro Apps,
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.280]   they spend most of their time
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.000]   looking at-- coming across something that sounds like a good fit
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.760]   for the product and then simply buying it and buying
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.160]   the company.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.200]   How much--
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.040]   How much development has done like inside Apple?
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.080]   And how much is just like--
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.440]   Everything was bought, right?
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.320]   Final Cut was bought.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.360]   Motion was bought.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.800]   Motion wasn't bought.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.040]   Basically what happened with Motion is that the--
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.000]   I mean, this is--
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.560]   I don't know the whole story, but basically--
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.480]   The upshot was is that these guys all worked at Autodesk,
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.840]   where a lot of people who did it,
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.640]   they were working on combustion.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:59.160]   And that-- they got freed up at Autodesk.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.680]   I'm not sure exactly what happened there,
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.080]   but they all left at the same time and all ended up at Apple.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.920]   And they got to develop an app, basically.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.520]   What do you want to do, kind of thing?
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.400]   And so motion is one of the apps that was kind of really
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.440]   created from the ground up.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.240]   I think Compressor is largely created from the ground up.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.240]   Soundtrack is--
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.440]   That's from the ground up.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.640]   It is, but I think it sits on top of technologies that they've--
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.240]   They've updated Soundtrack too, right?
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.280]   They've updated Soundtrack.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.320]   In fact, for the first time, I've been using Audition for a long time
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.440]   for recording and editing.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.120]   We're going to take-- once again, we're going to take a listen.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.240]   We've done it with one app.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.600]   We did it with two this time.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.600]   I always thought the Leo, I'm like, you got to try Soundtrack.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.840]   Well, if it's reliable, one of the new features
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.720]   sounds very interesting is auto-leveling on individual voices,
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.080]   which would really be nice for me.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.320]   So we're going to take a look at it this time.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.400]   No, it looks-- it's a great upgrade.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   And I think that if you're using this every day,
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.920]   you're going to definitely feel the changes, especially if--
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.560]   And we are very heavy motion users.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.000]   And so the updates to Motion is something that we're heavy
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.800]   final fit users to.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.960]   Now, just to be clear, because a lot of people like me
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.000]   can't afford Final Cut.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.120]   I bought Final Cut Express.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.760]   It's really a separate product, and it's not updated at the same time.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.400]   That's correct.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   It's not the same code base, even.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.080]   Yeah, I don't know how that code base works,
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.000]   but I think that it would normally come after that.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.320]   I'm not sure exactly how those two are tied together.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.520]   But the studio, I mean, it is unbelievable what you get.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.760]   Now, and this is both with the Adobe production bundle
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.560]   and Final Cut.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.640]   I mean, when you look-- I mean, I know I'm being an old geyser here
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.040]   for a second, but what you get on these applications
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.480]   is pretty amazing.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.320]   As far as production capacity, you really
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.080]   can make a full feature film with off-the-shelf families
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:33.960]   in these initial--
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.480]   Well, they've got the right in the front page
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.000]   at apple.com/finalcutstudio, Francis Fort Coppola,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.720]   and Walter Merch talking about their new movie
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.120]   that they made on Final Cut.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.640]   Yeah, and Walter Merch has been using it.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.600]   I mean, I think that one of--
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.080]   Usually was the guy that helped them so much, I think, right?
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.400]   Both in feedback and in promotion.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.280]   I mean, what happened was is that you get a guy like Walter
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   Merch using Final Cut and suddenly all the editors
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.640]   who have been working on these big films
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.440]   that will only look at Avid start really going,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   hmm, maybe I should take a look at this.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   In addition to that, he gave Apple enormous reams
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.200]   and reams and reams of feedback.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.800]   Was it while they were working on a cold mountain?
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.760]   My cold mountain.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.920]   And they gave him an early version,
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.440]   and then said this sucks.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.080]   Here's what you need to do if I'm going to use this,
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.400]   and then iterating over and over again,
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.680]   and really got a good product out of it
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.640]   by the end of that movie.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.720]   That's when Final Cut went from being kind of a prosumer
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.880]   editing tool to a professional editing tool.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.000]   All right, well, there you go.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.480]   Final Cut Studio, our little commercial.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.560]   And actually that ties into what we're about to do,
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.760]   which is our picks of the week.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.800]   Yay!
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.480]   Andy, Naco, Alex, Lindsey, and I will tell you
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.680]   some of our favorite things.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.360]   Before we do, though, we have to tell you
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.280]   about our favorite audio books from Audible.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.280]   Dotcom.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.120]   Audible is a great place.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.880]   Kind of your audio bookstore online.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.200]   If you've used the audio books in iTunes,
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.560]   you've listened to Audible books.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.840]   Those are Audible books.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.880]   But I do enough of them that buying a onesie-tousie
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.920]   in iTunes doesn't work for me.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.960]   I got to have a subscription.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.560]   So if you're that kind of person,
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.040]   if you've tried them on iTunes, go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.120]   and sign up at least for the gold account.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.640]   That'll give you a book a month.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.960]   And it's a huge discount when you do it that way.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   I have the platinum account because two books a month,
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.160]   even that's not enough for me.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.920]   I go through these like popcorn.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.760]   I love Audible.com.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.760]   What am I listening to right now?
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.440]   Something I really enjoyed.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.280]   What did you--
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.800]   Andy, it's been three weeks.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.040]   You probably have a few picks, actually, for us.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.000]   Come to think of it.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.880]   I have--
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.160]   It's like 90--
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.360]   It was 95 degrees.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   And just by the place we went in Asia,
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.560]   it is 91 degrees in humid here in New England.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.400]   So it's time for like a nice beach book,
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.200]   a nice summer book.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:49.480]   And it's a book of memoirs by the absolutely utterly adorable
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.360]   Christian Chenoweth.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.280]   It's called A Little Bit Wicked, Life, Love, and Faith in Stages.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.520]   It is seven hours of her basically telling stories about
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.920]   being in show business and being on Broadway
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.680]   and being up and coming and going to ward shows and stuff like that.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.280]   And she is--
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.720]   And she reads the book herself.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.040]   And she, again, you're just--
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:15.640]   You just want to visit the tiny, hollow tree that this woman lives in.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:21.560]   And then Bakeskin, Bakes Cookies for her little elves
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.040]   and the little squirrels and little woodchucks
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.680]   that come to tea every single day at Christian Chenoweth.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.960]   Has she done TV or movies?
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.520]   I saw her in Wicked, and she was wonderful.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:30.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.480]   No, she--
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.320]   Of course she was in Wicked.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.520]   She had pretty much the standard.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.840]   I'm going to spend two or three years as a character actress.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.880]   Playing the wife of the goofball husband in various comedies.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.040]   She was in Pushing Daisy's that really funny--
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:48.600]   Oh, that's right.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:49.640]   She was great.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.640]   That's a great, great show.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.160]   And frankly, she needs to record more albums
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.280]   because every time that Christian Chenoweth's song
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:03.320]   comes up on "Unshuffle Play," that's a time that I almost pull the car over
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.320]   and just have to hit repeat, repeat, repeat, because that's a good selection.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.480]   A couple of the songs she did for the TV show actually have wound up on the iTunes store.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.760]   Because I am not an 11-year-old.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.640]   Oh, she-- I know who she was.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.400]   She was the little one in the West Wing.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.760]   Yes.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.880]   The little one.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.080]   She was the little kid.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.840]   She was just a ball of fun.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.800]   I loved her in that.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.400]   To be fair, she's like five foot even if that.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.880]   And of course they have to have her in a couple scenes next to Alison Janney,
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.640]   who's like, I don't know, seven foot eight.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.800]   Gerndon reminded me, yes. Alex and Janney is huge.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.000]   Now I remember her.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.200]   Yes, of course.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.040]   But it's like, oh my god, that voice.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.520]   She's a classically trained singer.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.640]   And then she again, she made her first dose of fame just on Broadway in Wicked
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.680]   and You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:56.040]   Just one of the most beautiful, just gorgeous voices that you'll find on the iTunes store.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.680]   And again, just listening to this voice, it's a very high-pitched, girly voice,
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.040]   but in no way annoying.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.640]   It's just again, you're just like, I bet that every morning,
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.480]   she drinks her tea out of a tulip.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.640]   Yes, she is that type.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.960]   But the little with the lily pad has a saucer.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.600]   I believe that's how she has her tea every single morning.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.560]   And I know that I know that I'm basically,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.560]   I'm cutting this close to actually being so being insulting that I think she's so cute.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.240]   It really is.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.600]   I'm going to listen to this.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.920]   She has that great, actually, I could play you a little bit of her
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.560]   because you'll recognize the voice once you hear her reading.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.400]   "Praise myself in the full-length mirror, stability in one hand, sex in the other."
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.720]   The white Armani gown is the dress every little girl dreams of.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.760]   A lot of big girls too.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.520]   A line of blushing attendants, all picture pretty.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.160]   Clutch their book.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.040]   You recognize that voice?
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.480]   I recognize it now that I know that I know that I know that I know the narrator I'm pushing
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.200]   Daisy's Jim Dale, of course, does the amazing Harry Potter books.

[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:56.600]   And I want to I want to I want to make sure people know it's it is a fun summer book.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.240]   It's not like.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.520]   I left I left my career, my dress and my dignity in that casting book.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.360]   I decided that in there I would make my own way in this industry.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.440]   This gutters of filth and.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.160]   Where's that book?
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.040]   I want to get that book.

[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:54.280]   This just in from the unofficial Apple web blog there were before the Google voice official
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.080]   Google voice app.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.840]   There was a GV app, GV mobile app that was kicked out of the app store.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:05.320]   So Apple kicked out at the GV mobile app and refused the Google voice official app.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.400]   The GV mobile app is now available on Gerald broken iPhones.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.800]   I think it's let me see if it's your CD or who it's through, but you can get it.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.800]   So there you go.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   So you can get it on CD.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.720]   On mod, my M-O-D-M-Y-I repo.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:32.200]   So let's get to our picks of the day, ladies and gentlemen, and we can start with since Andy
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.760]   just did a book pick, let's start with Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:41.720]   I may or may not have an expensive app on the iPhone because you know, you got to
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:47.480]   you got to go search far and wide. I mean, anybody can find a 99 cent or $1.99 app.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.280]   But but I, you know, had to search for something that had a little bit more meat in it.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.960]   So this is not this is not for everyone.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.920]   But in my industry, this is an application that has I bought it before a shoot last week and just
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.240]   love it. It's called P cam and P or P or P.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   P.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.240]   C-A-M. C-A-M. Cinematography.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:18.360]   Yes. And so what what P cam does is it gives you a ton of calculations when you're on set to
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.000]   figure out. Did you recommend this last week? I don't think I did. I recommend P cam.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:23.560]   So familiar.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.000]   Did I do it again? I thought I.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.200]   You recommend this last week. You can't do it again.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.320]   No, I thought that I thought that I thought I hadn't recommended it.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.240]   I haven't slept very much today.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.800]   Brian, thank goodness Brian, you're in studio with us today.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.160]   Brian said, yeah, you did.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.320]   It sounded familiar.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.160]   So I'm going to do another one here.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:41.960]   This one is free.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.360]   This bird that gets contestant. You know, you lose a turn.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.280]   Yeah, you lose a turn.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:46.760]   I lost.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.960]   I was so excited about it.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.400]   And it's worked out so well.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.520]   Listen to last week's episode. You'll hear more about the lovely P cam.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.120]   I'm feeling a little unfilling a little.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.200]   Actually, I'm very relieved because I almost bought it.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.160]   I clicked the wrong button right here because I don't want to spend 40 bucks in an
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.480]   application for cinematography because I don't do any.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.680]   But the iTunes said, wait a minute, you got to give us some more information.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.160]   Thank God.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.840]   Thanks.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.000]   So another, another app, and I've been talking about this.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.920]   I talked a little bit about this without just your English,
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:17.560]   but another app that is is really awesome that I've started to play with is France 24.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.360]   Have you seen this?
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:18.680]   No.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.560]   It's the live streaming.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.040]   And let me talk about it.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:22.840]   This is a French channel?
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840]   This is, well, you can get it in English.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.440]   And so, and I'm just, I really think this is the future.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.280]   And so I just wanted to keep on, when these come out,
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   I just want to keep on telling people that they're here.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.120]   Because this is on 3G or Wi-Fi.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:36.440]   Wow.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.120]   See, that's 3G.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:38.440]   Wow.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.480]   The quality is spent.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.280]   Spectacular.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.680]   See, it makes me mad that they can do this.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.640]   And why aren't we, why can't we do this?
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.360]   I want to do this.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.320]   That's, it's no stuttering, no hesitation.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.680]   No, and it just pops right on.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.400]   That's 3G.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.000]   It's fairly low quality, but certainly good enough to watch.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.640]   But when you're watching the news, I mean, I mean, it's just.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.040]   One thing, the report is semi out.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.720]   Boy, that guy's French accent.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.520]   I can't understand him.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.800]   Who have actually seen the report,
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.240]   hasn't actually officially been released.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.720]   He's got such a thick French accent.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.920]   So they have an English language.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:11.960]   I didn't even know they had an English language.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.600]   I didn't know either.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.800]   And so, and so it's just a great, what happened was,
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.400]   I was talking about Al Jazeera English, I think.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.000]   And I got a bunch of people sending me these.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.480]   And, and in any way, a great streaming video, I think,
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.960]   especially with the dynamic streaming that's coming with,
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.120]   the people are starting to, going to be starting adding to the,
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   the streams is going to make a big deal.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.360]   And then the only other thing I wanted to say is
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.120]   that if you haven't updated your field runners, you need to.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.160]   Oh, yeah, it's been updated.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.200]   Oh my gosh.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.320]   Even better than before.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.880]   It's got these things that lob these huge bombs.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.280]   I hadn't updated it for a long time.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.800]   And suddenly the extended, I'm just telling you,
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.240]   if you haven't played field runners for a little while,
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.080]   you can turn it on to waste more of your life.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.560]   It's only when you're standing in line.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.040]   Okay.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.800]   But a long line at the airport now means I can play like a quarter of a game.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.800]   You know, while I'm just standing in line,
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.240]   then I get paused and wait for the next line.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:22:59.880]   No, that's true.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.520]   I'm with you.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.800]   Makes me very, I, I become,
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:06.200]   I have to admit, since I got my iPhone, I become a much more patient fellow.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.560]   You don't care.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.280]   You want a line.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.640]   Yeah, I'm like, oh, like, you know, the line.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.400]   No, I'm going to pick that longer line over there.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.440]   Yeah, it's a line.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.120]   All right.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:14.520]   All right.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.160]   You got it at France 24.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   See, there's never any really dersive picks.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.280]   That's the nice thing about this.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.080]   Andy and not co since you are champing at the bit.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.000]   Oh, no, no.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.480]   Well, this is, this is, I,
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.040]   I have to, whenever I choose a pick, I have to like,
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.760]   there's like a fixed number I'm trying to get to of two different scores.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:46.440]   I score this item based on how much do I love it and how easy is it going to be for someone to get it.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.120]   And so I'm picking something that's going to be very difficult to get,
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.560]   but I love quite a lot.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.240]   It is this thing right here.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.680]   It's a Rubik's Cube.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:55.800]   Sideways Rubik's Cube.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.960]   The easiest, the easiest Rubik's Cube ever.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.880]   If you got like a kid with low self esteem issues.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.560]   Okay, but now there's going to be a double reveal here.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.080]   I bought this in China.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.520]   Regular, ready for the first reveal?
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:06.920]   Okay.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.400]   Oh, it's a USB Rubik's Cube.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.480]   So what it looks like is it's like six, five boxes.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.920]   Looks like a Rubik's Cube on its side.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.800]   And then if you rotate it around and on one side is USB.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.880]   And each one of these cubes, you can rotate.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.200]   Okay.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.000]   So it's a hub.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.960]   It's a USB hub.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.560]   It's a four port USB 2.0 hub.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.400]   It also will accept power.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.080]   But you never have a problem with the widths of the device you're plugging in.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:43.000]   Well, it's actually the really cool thing is that I can have it like,
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.600]   I can basically set this up however I want.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.440]   So if I want it so that one device is sticking out one side,
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.680]   the other device is sticking out the other side,
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.280]   you know, like a tap, I can do it that way.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.880]   If I want to have them all lined up and so they're all facing one way,
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.080]   that's fine too.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.440]   Because sometimes again, you've got the microphone heading out to the east,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   you've got a keyboard or something heading out to the card reader heading out to the west.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.320]   And you basically have these.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.560]   Basically, I bought it because it's pretty much super cool looking and
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.200]   cut it right off.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.840]   And because no one else can get it without a trip to China.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.720]   Without a trip to China, I bought three of them.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.880]   I've already given away like all but this one.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.240]   Why don't you tell me about it?
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.080]   How expensive does that make that item?
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.640]   And that is a $3,000 item.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.040]   How much was it though?
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:31.560]   If you factor in the visa, it cost me converting it probably about $7.5.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.480]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.200]   So that's so that's so that's not a powered hub though.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.400]   You just plug it right into the.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.560]   Well, no, it is powered.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.440]   So you can you have to bring your own power adapter,
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.160]   but it will be a powered hub if you just simply stick a powered after.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.800]   I guess you could double you could do a double USB connection, right?
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.120]   You could you could do one of those little little powered ones out of one one USB
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.640]   and then hook that into the other one.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.000]   I suppose the problem is that I'm not sure.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.520]   Warranty service is going to be a problem.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.000]   This device.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.840]   I was I was really shocked because I totally about that really awesomely cool clock about in Japan.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.520]   And I liked it so much that I wanted to buy one for the downs.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.240]   It's like my it's my bedroom like nightstand clock.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.440]   I like it so much that I actually want to buy a second one for the office.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:18.040]   And after doing a little search, of course, I found somebody who actually like imports them.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.160]   And it's possible to actually buy them.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.480]   And I and this is like so cool and so unique.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.720]   It does in the right sort of target market, it says, what is what is that?
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.680]   And then as soon as you see a USB ports, like, I don't care how much it costs.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.160]   I want one.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:37.080]   I was I'm really surprised that when I do all I all it says on it is it's made by a company called
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.440]   Ostrand O S T R A N. And I thought, okay, I'm going to find somebody who imports these or
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.640]   someone who has these on eBay.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.320]   But nope, I can't find them anywhere.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.920]   So I'm sure that I'm sure that after this somebody like on the next trip is going to pack
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.600]   an empty suitcase and sell these if you sell these for 15 bucks each, you're going to make
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.080]   your money back.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:27:00.040]   If I were you, I would send a note to Jen Frazier at think geek and say, you must carry these.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.240]   Yeah, it's like if you I was certain that think geek or another one of these stores would at some
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.040]   point that would could have come across us and said, you know what?
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.960]   That's that's worth us spending a hundred bucks for a couple of dozen of these and see if we can't
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.040]   make ourselves a healthy $70 profit.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:19.080]   Well, my pick is something I'm actually a little hesitant to recommend because it's another one
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:25.400]   of those addictive iPhone games and anybody who has been on my Facebook page probably knows
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.120]   how addictive I am because this this is this is smart marketing on the part of this game.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.960]   Every time you unlock an achievement in the game, it offers to put that information on your
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:41.160]   Facebook stream. And if you've been watching at three or four in the morning for the last few nights,
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.240]   you'll see a bunch of unlocked achievements.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.880]   It's so pathetic. In fact, I shouldn't tell anybody about this game because it's just going to make
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:57.160]   you an addict. It's we need a support group. It's called I dig it. And it's kind of well,
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.360]   it's like dig dug on steroids or something that there is a light version, although spend the 99
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.760]   cents to get the full version. You're going to really enjoy it. The idea of this game is
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:13.800]   farmer John is farm is almost in foreclosure. He needs to raise a hundred thousand dollars.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:19.560]   He has four hours to do it. So he's converted one of one of his bulldozers into a digging
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:25.160]   tool with a big drill on the front. And he's digging under his farm for you know,
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.440]   oars, you know, stuff left behind by people. He also put a rocket engine in it so that as you
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.400]   dig down, you can fly back up. You collect all this stuff, you bring it up to the surface,
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:40.280]   there's dynamite involved. If you need to blow up some rocks, there's a whole bunch of different
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.200]   upgrades you can make to your bulldozer, including improved
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:51.720]   haul, coolant drill, radar, fuel tank, cargo. You could buy an auxiliary fuel tank. You could
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.400]   buy dynamite. It's it's the art looks amazing. It's beautiful. It's actually beautiful. I can
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.440]   you know, I can show you the game if you if you want to see it. I'm in the middle of it.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.640]   Oh, I don't need you to show it to me anymore. It's it's a very it's a very hard game.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:12.360]   Which is part of the problem. It's you know, it's challenging. I mean, I'll just show you a little
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.680]   pretty. It seems the seem it seems like this game is guaranteed to make sure that a you will blow
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.520]   whatever big deadline you have coming up in a couple of days. Thanks. And thanks to the Facebook
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:27.480]   integration that whatever excuse you do off your excuse, it's not work. You have no excuse.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.520]   Leo, congratulations on making it to level 12 and rescuing the princess. You're fired.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.720]   You'll have plenty of time to make the level 40. It also has great truck sounds in it. You know,
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:47.320]   as you drive around and you and you bulldoze stuff and it's really it's really a very satisfying
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.360]   kind of a game. I better pause it though, because if I start playing now, the show will never end.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:57.320]   That's called I dig it. It's a 99 cents, probably the worst 99 cents I ever spent.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:02.600]   The most expensive, most expensive. Literally probably 20 hours of my life shot the hell
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.920]   digging under this farm. It's all about lines. You will. This is good for lunch because it's very
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   important. You may pause it at any time. There an exit out of it. So you go right back to where you
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.840]   were. Yeah, that's actually what makes makes field runners really work for me. Yes. Is because I don't
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.160]   feel like I have to finish the game. And so what happens is I literally only fill up time that I'm
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.480]   bored. No, I'm with you. I don't I don't let myself use it while I'm working. I don't let myself,
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.640]   you know, you need to do that because the the camp then there's various ways to play, but there's
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.760]   the campaign, which is the real way to play where you got to raise a hundred thousand dollars for the
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.920]   bank. Right. Is a four hour campaign. You have four hours to raise that money. Now that the bad
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:39.480]   thing about it, setting that time limit, it's real time, is that you know exactly how much time you
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:47.160]   wasted on this program. And what's really bad, and it happened to me, four hours into it, I failed.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:52.360]   And so I had to start all over again. Not good. Yeah, the big savior with field runners now,
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.800]   they have fast forward. Yeah, I love the fast forward. You have to unlock that, but yeah,
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:00.360]   you can you can zoom you can save some time. Yeah, yeah. I'm using your technique.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.520]   This would be an online component to this game that finds out whatever the federal minimum wage
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:11.000]   is. And if you were working at McDonald's, you would have made $430 a amount of time you spent playing
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.280]   so 99 cents. Yes, but really the real cost. Your livelihood, your brains, your health and
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   thanks for screwing up the economy for the rest of it. I dig it. And you'll probably see some more
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:32.280]   achievements from me on my Facebook page. Facebook. Up there, the old CV.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:40.040]   I think that's really brilliant. I was I was a successful independent media producer and publisher
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:48.440]   2009, upward professional digger. I'm a good digger. I think this is really smart marketing because
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:53.080]   you tie it. I think more programs should do this because it's kind of like an ad every time you
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.880]   level up on this thing. I am officially ace. Actually, I got to the point I was so embarrassed,
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:04.440]   I stopped sending the updates to Facebook. You have the choice. And I thought people can really
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:11.000]   think I'm an idiot. So I just stopped. All right, that wraps this up. I've got to go play some games.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.800]   And you're embarrassed up stage must take precedence over. That's right. Yes, that's it. I have a
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:23.480]   important meeting with the with the princess. So thank you everybody for being here. Andy Anaco
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:28.760]   is of course with the Chicago Sun times and the celestial ways to bandwidth C w O B dot com and a
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:36.200]   great friend. It was so much fun spending time with you on the cost co-classica. And I hope it was
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:42.600]   a perfectly fine ship. Let's let's not make me let let lovely man Neil think that he put us on a
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.720]   monkey ship. It was a very fine ship. You know, it was as always with Mac Manians, it's a blast.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.160]   And it's because of the people on it. It was just a lot of fun. I went to Andy watch,
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.800]   Andy, Andy watched me. It was fun. We had a great time. And it's just a chance to socialize,
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.640]   with people kind of out of out of that context, which really makes it worthwhile.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:04.120]   Maybe next time we'll get the lovely and talented Alex Lindsey to join us. He's the
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:12.360]   copo decapo of pixel core pixel core dot com. If you want to join that great guild of multimedia

[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.960]   of a hiatus over the summer for Mac break studio, but we are coming back full for us. We're recording
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:47.400]   on Thursday to cover the new Final Cut Pro studio features. And we've got some of the best guys
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.760]   in the world. I was wondering why you had all that written down there now. I understand. Yeah, so

[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.840]   it was my attempt to put the rat holes, you know, outside the show, but they get into the show
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:28.600]   anyway. So we do a whole bunch of rat hole. Before we begin, usually around 11 a.m. Pacific
