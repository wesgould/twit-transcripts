[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.280]   Enks from tidbits because Renee Richie is on his way down to CES. We're going to talk
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.640]   about 2017. Here it is. What are Apple's big moves going to be in the 2017 timeframe?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.400]   We're talking about a new iPhone, new iPads, new Macs. Well, we'll find out with our panel
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   next on Mac Break Week.

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:42.320]   Bye bye.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   And joining me to my right, we've repositioned him. Because I think Carsten is dyslexic.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.000]   You always end up on the right. You're supposed to be over here. It's Andy and I know I'm
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.440]   a man of habits. Andy and I go for the Chicago Sun times on my left.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.240]   This is like the traditional Soviet Union Mayday parades. Every time there's a shift in who
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.320]   sits closer or far this way from the premier or on what side it means something that CIA
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.840]   analysts will then have to scrutinize very, very closely.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.360]   Sitting directly behind Premier Gorbachev, Alex Lindsay of the Pixel Core.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.960]   And Boris Yeltsin joins us today in the form of Adam Anxt from Tidbits.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   Howdy.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.960]   You don't have the birthmark.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.800]   Yeah, but I got the penguin who is still in the past holidays.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.680]   Right. Actually, it was Gorbachev who had the birthmark.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.720]   And you do have the holiday penguin, which is good.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.280]   Yeah, penguins are slow to change the change. They like their dark.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.160]   It's not Russian Orthodox Christmas yet.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   Not yet.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   Little Christmas has yet to come.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   That's right.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.680]   My Christmas tree is still up. My happy Halloween door hanger, which my dad used to
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   traditionally keep up until.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's, you know, in my family, like my parents passed away, people who wanted the silverware,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.560]   people who wanted, you know, the, the hope chest from the wedding.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   I wanted like the cardboard hallmark. Happy Halloween door hanger that dad bought for
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   Halloween one year, but then decided that he's going to have it on the door for every
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.800]   specific holiday. Sometimes taping up a little covering up the Halloween with Christmas or
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   birthday or whatever has needed. That was one of the few things that I said, I will.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   I'm willing to die on this hill. I get, I get the 15 year old torn up $3 cardboard happy
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.240]   Halloween thing. And fortunately, they let go without a fight oddly enough.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.600]   When is Russian Orthodox Halloween? Is it?
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   Well, there's because of the later harvest.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.040]   I have to look it up. I think it's next week. I actually have to look it up because I don't
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.600]   have. I don't have the metronome of mom. Call me.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.040]   Okay. Now remember, we're going to have Christmas is coming. We're going to have the sausage
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.160]   and we're going to have the the honey and poppy seed. So yes, I always have to look that
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   up.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.240]   Let us this first new show of a 2017 for show of 2017. It's great to have you all once again
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.080]   to talk about the Mac. I got my AirPods. Do you all get your AirPods or do you care?
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.600]   Not yet. I usually find I usually find all the bugs have been kind of worked out.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.280]   Don't care. Doesn't want the bugs. Who cares?
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.680]   I just wait until they when they start shipping and they catch up with demand. Usually that's
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.640]   about the same time when most of the bugs have been sorted. So I just wait.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.840]   My problem is that I got this little thing here. It's this tiny one year Bluetooth earbud
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.800]   and it costs literally $13 on Amazon.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.560]   But it doesn't have the W one ship.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.960]   It doesn't. But I can buy 12 of these for the same cost as AirPods.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the fact is that I don't give a damn about quality or anything like that. I'm listening
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.800]   to a podcast while I'm doing yard work or something. So this is just like put it in and
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.560]   you know, we'll say it's actually worked perfectly. It stays in so well that I have to kind of
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.080]   pop my ear out from the back to get it out.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   And so yeah, so $160 for a pair of AirPods versus 13 bucks for this little thing from
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.280]   China. I guess I'll go for the little thing from China.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.360]   I'm looking forward to reviewing them like when Apple sends me a pair. But so I'm not
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.640]   saying I don't care about them. But as a consumer, it's this and this is not a comment. This is
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.240]   a comment on my style. This is not a comment on the design of these AirPods. It's that
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.120]   I don't have $170 to spend on headphones period because I just don't use like Adam said,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.760]   if I'm wearing headphones, it's because I'm on a train or a bus somewhere or I'm taking
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.360]   a walk. If I'm listening to music and I really want to appreciate the quality of the music,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.200]   I actually have very nice like plug in headphones in the house that are big cans sort of like
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.960]   that. And so I just don't have a need for them. And also also I'm the sort of dope who
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.640]   will lose a $170.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.040]   I'm not the best target for this.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.280]   Yeah, I'm doing yard work. So I'd lose them like and then the lawnmower would eat them
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   or something.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   Yeah, you guys are really swimming upstream. Tim Cook says they've been runaway success.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.080]   They're huge.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   Are you biased or something?
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:39.480]   A little bit. Now my question really is I like these a lot. I have to say I like them
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.240]   a lot. In fact, to me, this is Apple getting its mojo back a little bit where yeah, I
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   mine and function are beautifully married and you get the little click, which I really
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   know.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   That's absolutely no one.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.120]   Like those those four feedback things, you know, they're I bought some cheap lightning
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.760]   cables, you know, packs of five for $11 or something thing. You know, that'll be great.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.800]   We'll just throw something. It's when we throw them out for table on tables and stuff like
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.880]   that. And the fact that that they didn't click when you push them into the iPhone,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   no one had to deal with them. Yeah, everyone was like, ah, this is I don't know if this
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.800]   is working or not. These are, you know, we can't put these on our phones. And so those
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.040]   little things make a huge difference.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.760]   These have magnets everywhere when I put the the pods into the thing they snap in. The
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.240]   sound quality is good. I'm told it's the same hardware for the sound reproduction is
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.640]   on the ear, the ear pods, the wired ones, which aren't the best in the world. And for
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.400]   the price, you'd expect maybe something a little better, but they sound really good
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.960]   to me, especially for spoken word. The microphone sound good. I have had one weird issue and
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.840]   I don't know if it's going to, it's not happened again, but I've only had them since
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:59.200]   I got home on Saturday. I wanted to leave a voice recording to see, you know, if they,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.240]   you know, how the sound quality was with the microphone. So I was in the car and I said,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:10.600]   talk, make noise, talk amongst yourself. And I dialed my own number. And I immediately
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.960]   thought it was a little weird because the the ringing sound was it wasn't the it was
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:25.480]   and then I left the voicemail. Let me see if I can find it because it's there was something
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:32.880]   going on. Now, maybe this is an issue with, I don't know, maybe you guys can can tell
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.440]   me what's an issue with the voicemail. Shoot, where is it?
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:45.280]   Our viewers had found that there were sound quality problems when you were talking, that
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.240]   it didn't seem to be able to have full bandwidth in both directions. So you started to lose
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.200]   audio quality if you were using the mic. Well, listen to this and tell me now, I don't
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.160]   know, Carson, can you hear my audio? You probably don't know yet. Let's try it.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:07.480]   [inaudible]
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.240]   We capture that in case we want to do sort of sci-fi.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.200]   Which Star Wars character is that? I know exactly. I wish I could.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.080]   Carbonite. That's half. I wish I could reproduce that, but I haven't been able to. So I don't
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.840]   know if that was a pairing issue or what. I mean, I was using it to listen to music just
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.600]   fine, then I dialed the phone. And like I said, the warning was that the dial tone was
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   really pitched down. And then that, you heard the message. But the problem is, I really didn't
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.360]   have any, if you weren't paying attention, or you just thought, well, that's what the
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.480]   ringtone sounds like, you might have left that message and let's hope it wasn't an important
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   person that you were calling.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.360]   Well, you know, there's a lot of, you know, you just have to learn how to turn that bug
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.920]   into a feature, you know, back when we had that antenna problem, you know, what I, you
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.360]   know, the big advantage of that antenna problem that we had with a, with the former iPhone,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.720]   I don't know what it was, the five or the four or whatever, was that if you held it
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.320]   just right, it would drop the call. So you're talking to someone and you were able to get
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.600]   out of the call without overtly hanging up on it. You could just just hold it.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.280]   You have to do the, I'm losing the signal.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.880]   You could just hold it on your chin and let me just tap by and set up a certain thing.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.880]   Because it was a call drop.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.600]   That's the only way to call a soft, a soft drop rather, a hard drop is I'm just going
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.880]   to hang up on you. But a soft drop is just, I'm just going to hold it the wrong way.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.840]   You know, so anyway, it has happened again, although I haven't left any messages since
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   then. I'm wondering if this might have been the reason they were held up. And by the way,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.920]   Tim Cook's runaway success really goes along with the quote, we're making them as fast
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.160]   as we can, which given that there was such a delay, maybe isn't all that fast. I don't
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.160]   know.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.680]   I like them. I like them in every other respect.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.960]   You know, it was interesting. I say you're talking about the delay though, because if
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.840]   you, as soon as they went on sale online, some people were able to get them right away.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.080]   And then if you got in later that day, it was a four week wait.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.760]   Yes. And that's what I got by the way, Adam. I got this was supposed to come January 12th
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.400]   and they came early.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   But next, but now, and you know, very shortly after, it's a six week wait. So that's a long
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.040]   time. I mean, Apple is making as fast as they can, but you know, when they have fast
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.640]   reasons together one at a time, because they got three people on the line, you know, maybe
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.600]   not so much. So who knows? It's a, he could be telling the absolute truth and still be
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   someone's moment.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.640]   I can absolutely vouch for the ease of pairing them because you just, you know, you would
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.560]   put it next to your phone, open the lid and it goes, Oh, I see your AirPods. And then
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.360]   iCloud syncs that pairing. So it appears on my iPads and my Mac and Tushas as well.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.960]   And that's really, yeah, that's really, so that's the W one chip, right? That's the
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   benefit of that.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:52.520]   Yeah, it's, I mean, this is, we've, we've had good cause to question where Apple has been
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.560]   going in their engineering decisions over the past year. But this is absolutely everything
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.640]   we hope to get from an Apple product. I mean, just these little things where it's, it was
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.720]   not terribly easy to fit magnets where they're supposed to go. It was not terribly easy to
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   design a brand new chip that if it recognizes that it's going to be communicating with an
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.200]   Apple product, it can actually do a lot more mojo to make the, to take a lot of the, a
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.840]   lot of the BS out of using Bluetooth. They could have made a very, very, very good set
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.000]   of wireless earbuds for 100 bucks, 150 bucks and people would have been very happy with
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.800]   them. But this is the, I really want, if I have used them, I don't know, I don't own
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   a pair, but I've used them. And it really does feel like the, I remember the quote that
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.040]   the engineers were using on the design of the iPhone where we started off by taking
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.720]   the phones, we were the smartphones, we were using out of our pockets and complaining about
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.360]   things we hated about them. And it seems as though they said the first step was we're
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   going to take the Bluetooth headphones out of our bags and out of our pockets and complain
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.720]   about everything we hate about them and make sure that ours don't do any of that.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.680]   Here's the cool thing. If you hold the, can you see, do you have the over the shoulder
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:08.560]   carsten? If you, you could see my phone, if I open the dental floss case next to my phone,
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.200]   it pops up not only with the name of the earpuds, but the current battery situation with both
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.440]   the headphones and the case with, of course, the case is a charging case. That's kind of
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.720]   nice. There's little things like that. This, this is a very appily product. I think again,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.840]   and function beautifully married in an, in an elegant way. And also maybe a little, a
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.400]   few glitches. We're seeing some battery life issues. People are complaining that the battery
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   life will drain very rapidly. Right. One point out what they'll.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.000]   Exactly. One point. And also, I think one of the things that people sometimes forget
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.880]   is that so much of what Apple's doing in hardware now is driven by enough custom software
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:51.160]   that they can really fix things with software updates. So it's not like, Oh yeah, the first
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.880]   hardware that you got will need to, you'll have to wait till the second revision of the
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.720]   hardware. They'll, they'll, they'll ship an update at some point and it'll just fix the
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.520]   stuttering problem or whatever it was with your voicemail, that kind of stuff.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   Yeah. Well, we'll see. We hope, we hope, ultimately all voicemail is going to suck.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.280]   Yeah. And I got over the, the dopiness of walking around with these things hanging out
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.840]   of my ears. I mean, they don't look that bad. Do they?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.400]   They're fine. I, I, I really wish that they, that they went all the way in. I mean, I,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.040]   you know, and, and figure out something else for the mic, but I mean, I, I really, yeah,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.480]   I don't really like the idea. I don't like the form factor of the original, of the iPhone,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.640]   the iPod, you know, like earphones that come with the iPhone. So I think that's part of
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.960]   my problem. I think you have to understand that these are neither nor is canceling nor
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.800]   like the Edomodix ceiling. They're just like the, the, I, I, you know, regular headphones,
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.960]   the wired headphones, they, you can hear people talk. Although that's an advantage. I mean,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.920]   I could put both of them in and walk around and look dorky, but I could still hear everything
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.840]   that's going on. Um, and then, you know what I really want? And I mentioned this yesterday
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.240]   in iOS today, I think it could be so cool if there was a hearing aid mode for this, because
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.640]   hearing aids, my hearing aids costs $6,000. Hearing aids are very, very expensive. All
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.840]   you'd need to do is have the microphones beyond all the time. You'd have full stereo reproduction.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.040]   These could be amazing hearing aids, I think. Yeah. You're reminding me that I haven't
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.600]   talked to my, uh, my usual, uh, CNI geek about that. I'd be surprised if there wasn't,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.400]   I'd be surprised if it doesn't support a mode that would not be familiar to someone who
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.640]   doesn't use hearing aids every day. Uh, and so that's what we expect from Apple. And so
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.920]   I'm there. They're so committed to this sort of thing. I'd be surprised if there's any
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.400]   obstacle.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:45.840]   My wife did a, um, a artistic, uh, photo shoot of me wearing them in real life. They are,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   they are a look. It's a, I'll say that. One is better than two almost. Really? Yeah. Like
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.560]   one looks intentional. Two looks like you're wearing hearing aids. Yeah. It looks intentional
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.720]   like you think it's jewelry. I don't think we'll have long to wait before you can buy
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.960]   them in colors. Like I could see this being a lot less shocking if it were like a gray
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.400]   or a black. Yeah. Why is it?
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.140]   I get, I keep, I keep thinking that one of the best like hacks you could do to these
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:21.400]   things is just to get some like, uh, like rubber cement or something and protect like
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.960]   the microphone ends of it and just like drizzle them like over like the white plastic. So
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.200]   it looks like your ears are leaking ear wax. Because at least it'll be like really cool
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   and.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:41.520]   Exactly. Awesome. Disgusting. Uh, okay. Or, or, or, or for like, or, or, or maybe for,
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.880]   for, for, for a friend, uh, the, the, the, the, the beard of truth, uh, have it like color,
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.280]   mix it, mix like red food coloring into the thing. So I was like, that's, I'm just so
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.200]   metal. You're eating from this. I don't even care.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   The other thing I should point out, uh, to make the review complete is that this one size
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   fits all and that doesn't fit everybody. My wife has very, uh, small ears, small ear canal.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   And, uh, she has to usually get different tips for her headphones and things. And, uh,
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.120]   she said these fit, but they're uncomfortable after a little bit because they really are
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.040]   kind of in there. So just you should try before you buy. I, but as I said, I think not bad.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.800]   The price is a sticking point for a lot of people, but not bad. The other, uh, review
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.440]   I'd like to kind of round off is this MacBook Pro. And, uh, I'm, I'm sad to say this, but
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.680]   I think the track, the touch bar is a flop. Very disappointed in it. Um, I love the fingerprint
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.600]   reader. Touch ID is great. And every laptop should have that as many PC laptops have for years.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:50.080]   Um, but I don't find the track bar useful because it's always changing unless I guess if you lived
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.400]   in Photoshop or you lived in Lightroom all the time and then you'd know what it was saying all
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.120]   the time, but you have to look down and the, and the reason now I'm having to say,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.080]   and by the way, I don't think I'm alone. I have to say this is not something you should avoid is
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.920]   I hit it a lot. And even Renee Richie, who loves it, admitted that he had to turn off the
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.800]   Siri button, which is normally in the upper right, uh, because he kept getting Siri activated.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.600]   It's not hard. Maybe I'm a sloppy typist to accidentally hitch the touch bar, which,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.720]   depending on what part of it you hit will interrupt your typing with a, you know, pop up something
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.800]   or Siri will pop up. And so I, I, I'm of the opinion. I'd love to hear what you guys think that
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.160]   you should avoid. I hate to say this, the MacBook Pro with touch bar. I don't, I don't think it's,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.400]   well, I don't think it's a, it's a bomb. I think that I've had some, I've had more time to use it
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.480]   now. Uh, my review is just, my reaper has just started with it. Um, I think it's a lot like force
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.920]   touch on the phone where it will become spectacular once you yourself find that one app that, oh my
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.960]   God, the rails are greased from between me and productivity city. Thanks to the fact that I've got
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   this set of shortcuts in this, in this tool and give yourself time for your brain to rewire to
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:11.360]   make that part of the part of where you look for, uh, for cool bits of interface. I will say that at
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.840]   this point, I really think that Apple could have come up with a much more clever way to integrate
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:24.640]   that kind of touch into not just the current MacBooks, but the entire MacBook line. The more I,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.960]   the more I use the touch bar, the more I keep wishing that the magic trackpad, for instance,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.640]   what if they made a force touch, uh, OLED, a magic trackpad that was the size of a three,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.040]   three by five card, something so that you could do signatures on it. You could do not just little
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.560]   tiny, little like tic-tac little buttons on it, but you could have like actual icon, little help
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.680]   buttons and real like full color palettes. And it would solve the problem of is this, uh, of the
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.640]   kind of mental hiccup that I keep having between are these graphical interface buttons or are they
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.240]   keys on my keyboard? No, I'd say no, this is my control pad. You could, I keep wishing that like
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.040]   in Final Cut, I could just configure, I could just click a button, click options for, oh, I see you
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.600]   have one of these, how would you, what would, what tools would you please drag the following tools
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.680]   that you'd like to use into this? One of the things I would have would be like just a jog controller,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   so I could just scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, stop. That's the frame I
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.600]   want. I just, I get more excited about what that kind of a device could be than I get about what
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.840]   the touch bar is. And I think that I worry, I guess I wouldn't say worry that this is a
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   transitional technology to a glass keyboard, which would with force with force feedback,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:50.320]   which, which very much concerns me because I would hate it. So, and I, you know, so that's the
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.880]   concern I have. Of course, I just wanted to touch screen for Christmas and didn't get it. So, you
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.600]   know, we're still, we have to update, you know, 20 or 30 of these computers and we're not sure
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.760]   what to do. You know, we kind of wish we had bought a bunch of the older ones before and just hung
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.080]   out for a while. We're not, we're not that excited about the new ones right now. Again, a lot of us
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.280]   spend a lot of, put a lot of these on the road. And I know that there's little adapters and
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.120]   everything else, but the, the, the absence of the MagSafe is, is a huge killer for us because
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.440]   it has saved us so many times. Well, you've seen the Griffin effect, Patrick Delahanty.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.640]   I've been tweeted it every time I mentioned it on the show, I get tweeted. I have one if you
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.160]   want to see it. So Patrick Delahanty bought it and he says it saved his life. You have to use a
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:43.120]   special cable with your adapter type C cable. And it has on it on the end here, a breakaway type C
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.800]   thing. So let me show you, I'll put it in the, if I got it, if I got one, I would definitely,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.960]   and if I, if I break down and buy one to test, I would definitely have by that. I mean, there's
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.440]   no way I would own one of these without the, the problem is, is that little nub sticking out is
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.120]   not something I can just leave in the computer. It's a leverage point that's going to ruin that
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.520]   USB-C if you leave it in there and put it in your backpack. But you don't leave it in there.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.400]   You, it's part of the cable. It's, it's, oh, anyway. Well, and it's an additional expense.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   It's the basic, I don't care about the basics. I just, it's the basic thing if you had something
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.200]   that worked great for you and now it's not there anymore. It's not just me. It's probably one of the
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.000]   most strenuous inventions that Apple ever did. And they, and they took it away for no good reason.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.760]   Right. I mean, for every individual, that's, it's easy and quite correct for someone to say,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.000]   like, when I, when I rail on about the flatness of the keyboard, say, oh, come on, it feels great.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.040]   I don't know why you keep complaining. Just give yourself time to get used to it. And that's
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.840]   perfectly correct from that person's point of view. And they're right to, to, if I were to say that
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.280]   it is hands down a terrible keyboard, objectively a bad keyboard, I'd be completely wrong. But when
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.840]   it comes to, I've got $1,500 of my money or $2,000 from my money. It's, it is a deal breaker for me,
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.680]   the way that the banks are for you. And this is the sort of problem. These are the sort of problems
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.360]   that Apple will confront as they remove things that individuals seem to like. They start to look
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:08.240]   a little bit, if you do this enough times and suddenly the next time they've got 1,500 bucks in
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.480]   their pocket to buy a new laptop, maybe they're look, they're not, you know, there's a mic, they're
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   in one of the seven malls in America where there's a Microsoft store and an Apple store in the same
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:25.200]   mall. Maybe they, while they're waiting for their kid to come back from the food court,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.400]   you walk in and you try a surface tablet and oh my goodness, it's not as sucky as it was when
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.800]   you're using Windows 95. And that's the fish hook gets into that person's mouth and
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.560]   and that's how it happens. You combine that with the unpredictable battery life, which
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.480]   everybody, including consumer reports now, solve that. I think the software. I think it's a software
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.200]   thing. Yeah. The keyboard is interesting. My, Tonya has, I haven't typed on it significantly,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   but my father was interested in getting a new laptop and or an iPad with a keyboard. And so
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.160]   he just wanted, I took out, you know, a MacBook Air and the MacBook new MacBook Pro and some iPad
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:13.280]   stuff I had around and everything. And he instantly loved the MacBook Air keyboard. He instantly hated
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:19.760]   the MacBook Pro keyboard. Yeah, just like it was just just, you know, first thing touches it.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.600]   He says like, my wrists are already starting to hurt. I was like, okay, I don't know why, but,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.800]   you know, if you don't like it, you don't like it. And you know, I can't tell you what's right.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.600]   There is a great component of psychology in that, right? But it was, no, he didn't, he didn't have
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.800]   any preconceptions. He didn't. Okay. He didn't. It was just like, I want to try keyboards. And
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.840]   I was like, okay, here's one. Here's another one. Here's another one. Here's another one. Yeah.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.920]   And yeah, and he's like, yeah, I love this one. I hate this one. Okay. You know, whatever you like.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.760]   Get out. Well, when I started, I didn't have any strong opinion about it when I got the 12
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.040]   inch and I got the 12 inch and I just realized I just wasn't writing anything long. I didn't want
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.640]   to write anything long form on it. So I would, I was sitting there and I got an answer email on
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.800]   a plane, which is what kind of what I used it for. And then I realized I wasn't even putting my
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.560]   bag. I was like, if I have this, I might as well, the way I'm using it, I might as well go back
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.160]   to an iPad. You know, like, you know, like, you know, like, because I was the 12 inch was really
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:15.280]   for me when I get in economy, an economy scene that can't open my laptop. And so, or if I'm in
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.360]   it, some kind of cramped position, but I was like, for what I'm using it for, I was using an iPad
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.160]   because I can draw on the screen. So without having that wasn't worth it.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.880]   I like using my iPad because like the keyboard is so much better. I've actually been, I need
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.040]   for a quick trip last week, I actually snapped it into my create keyboard from Logitech, which I
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.920]   haven't used a lot because it makes it a lot thicker. And it just reminded me of what a brilliant
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.560]   keyboard they've got in there and how it kicks the butt of not just the new MacBooks keyboard,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.320]   but the my current MacBook Pro keyboard, which was also a little bit thinner and a little bit less
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.120]   responsive. And I mean, I was, I found myself, someone was asking me for recommendations on iPad
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.680]   keyboards. And I find myself saying, when the question is keyboards, the answer is almost always
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:08.720]   Logitech. And it just, goodness, someone hires somebody important from Logitech, someone who has
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:15.520]   big male or female, big, strong, metaphorical, meaty hands to grab the lapels of someone who is
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.840]   saying, it's okay if we make the keyboards not good. That says, no, no, no, I've spent 20 years
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.880]   dealing with people and trying to make keyboards better, we are not going to make the keyboard
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.160]   any smaller, we are going to make it bigger and thicker, we're going to make the keyboard
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.000]   switches much, much better than they were before. And because I have this big picture of ice water,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.360]   and I can port right down your pants, you are going to agree with me on this point.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:47.680]   So, I don't want to let this go. You mentioned, Adam, I think you said that you felt firmware
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.080]   would fix the battery problem. Why is that? What's going on?
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.600]   I mean, the big thing in the Mac, obviously, is the system management controller, which is doing
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.760]   a huge amount of that stuff in terms of tracking what's going on behind the scenes. I mean,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.520]   it's even possible. I mean, I haven't had one of these that I've been able to play with, but
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   it's impossible, I would think, that resetting the system management controller might help these
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.920]   people who are having battery problems. The fact that it's inconsistent says to me, there's something
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.480]   low level, which is confused. Inconsistent doesn't sound like hardware, right? I mean,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.080]   the hardware's got to be pretty much the same. And so, it's inconsistent, really, feels like there's
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.600]   some bug in a particular usage scenario, or configuration scenario, or...
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:39.680]   Who knows what? Yeah, you're right. It could be something like switching from the onboard
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:45.840]   graphics to discrete graphics randomly, or repeatedly, that would absolutely be a problem.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   I would think we would notice something like that, wouldn't you? Maybe not.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.880]   Well, but, again, you never really know what's happening behind the scenes, because so much is
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   going on now. I mean, right. The physical hardware, the battery, isn't inconsistent,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.800]   I wouldn't think. So, it must be something the software's doing in an interaction with the battery.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.400]   Well, it'd be nice if they fix it. I mean, consumer reports, actually, for the first time,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.840]   and I think in my memory, did not recommend the NIMAC but pros for the inconsistent battery problem.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.120]   Well, so there's also that thing going on with what is it? The iPhone 5S and 6, I think,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.880]   with... There's something like 30% battery problem, and they get to 30% and they kind of die.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.840]   It's really about... It's 40 when it's warm and 65 when it's cold. I have one.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.440]   But I should say that we're now hearing a very similar thing with the AirPods.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.680]   So there may be some family of problems. I don't know.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:49.920]   Well, and so here's the thing. Apple said that they were putting in iOS 10.2 some additional
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.560]   diagnostic information to try to figure out what's going on. So, they know something's happening.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   They don't know how to fix it yet, but they basically, they're putting in more logging.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.160]   And so, the hope is, is that, yeah, once they actually are spewing tons of logs about what's
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.360]   going on at the power level, they can start to say, "Oh, it's that." Okay, fine. We'll change that,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.760]   and you'll see 10.2.1 or 10.3 or whatever it is that will resolve it.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.880]   And I'm hoping the same kind of thing is what we're going to see on the MacBook Pros.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.160]   No, and I only bring it up. I don't want to be nitpicky. I only bring it up so that people
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   who are considering a MacBook Pro, which is, frankly, a fairly expensive purchase, understand
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.280]   what some of the potential pitfalls are. It wouldn't be as big a deal if you didn't see
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:36.960]   manufacturers making PC, Windows-based hardware, in a much broader range, a variety of form factors
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:43.120]   for a much lower cost with much longer battery life in many cases. So, there's a competition,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.240]   but it's not a one-to-one competition because, frankly, many of us don't want to use Windows.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:58.960]   And so, if you want to use Mac OS, it's always going to be a, think of it as a point system.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.880]   And every time you spend more than $10, more than a breed of worth of your money on technology,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.920]   it really has to earn a certain number of points before it earns your purchase.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:16.480]   And don't, just because you've bought a Mac or Windows machine every single time for the past 20
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.760]   years, doesn't mean that a Windows machine should bid your next machine or your Mac to be your
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.640]   next machine. That's always an opportunity to ask yourself, what do I need a computer to do
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:31.760]   now in 2017? And how can this next MacBook do that as well or better? And I'm not saying,
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.600]   jump to Windows, I'm saying seriously consider getting an iPad Pro, because you might be surprised
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   if you've never really thought of it. Maybe it's because you haven't really looked at what the
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.720]   iPad can do since two years ago, the last time that you seriously considered using it as one
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.200]   of your main devices. So, every single time, unless a computer solves a major tech purchase,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.160]   either solves a problem for you or creates an opportunity for you, you probably should just
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:08.960]   keep your money in your wallet. Good advice, dad. Thank you. There is a story, and I guess
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:16.480]   Mac rumors got this from Reddit, that a software reset has worked for some users to fix the battery
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:23.280]   drain issue on the AirPods. If that's the case, then firmware fix clearly would also fix that
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.720]   problem. So, we will watch with interest. I don't know how you reset the AirPods,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:35.760]   but I guess if you find this article. We found Josh Center is our managing editor who has a pair
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.120]   of these, had some problems where he was actually losing connection on his iMac, and then getting
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.640]   stuttering and stuff like that. And he tried a bunch of different things, and then after all
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.120]   that, the thing that finally worked was to unpair it, so from all the devices, power everything off,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.120]   so that there can be no question. Power just the iMac on,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.600]   compare it to that, and then bring everything else back up. It picks up everything else as it goes.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:09.280]   Once he did that, it was fine everywhere else too. So, there's always that clean slate of
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.520]   just start from scratch. And it's harder and harder to do that, because everything's trying to do
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   stuff for you now. But sometimes, according to this Redditor, if you press and hold the
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.400]   setup button, there's a button on the back, which is not immediately obvious.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   For 15 seconds until you see the status light flash amber a few times in flash white,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.880]   you will have reset it, and you will of course need to repair. But it's so easy to repair. It's
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:42.480]   not a big deal. And this comes from actually an Apple support thread, not Apple itself, but an
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:52.080]   Apple support thread from DAIJ Holt. So, I haven't noticed it, so I'm not going to mess with it,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:59.440]   but if I do, that's I guess the fix. You shouldn't see big battery drops, it's not draining much.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:07.040]   Let's take a break, come back. We do have news from Apple, and I'm curious what you think is
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:14.080]   going to be the next big shoot a drop from the Apple in 2017. Adam Engst is here from tidbits,
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:22.000]   the first and longest continuous running Apple newsletter since the early 20s tidbits.com
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.520]   since the turn of the century. That's even better. Since the turn of the century. Wow.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.280]   Since before the turn of the century. Oh, man. Since last century.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:41.120]   Wow. Back in the 19th century. Back in the 20th century, there was this thing called tidbits.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:47.680]   tidbits.com. It's always good to have you, Adam. And don't forget the take control series of
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:55.440]   ebooks, which are always hideously useful. Hitties are new tagline, hideously useful.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:03.520]   And it's not a good that's not a force. It's so useful. You'll want to kill it with fire.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:09.120]   That's Andy and I go Chicago Sun times and celestial waste to bandwidth C w o v.com.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.680]   And of course, Alex Lindsay is here from the pixel course. Follow him on Twitter to keep up
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.200]   on what's going on on the pixel core a l a a or just listen to me randomly complain about people
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   putting images in their footers, their email. I saw that. Oh, you said you do that.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.280]   Don't send me an attachment because I won't open it. Why? Well, no, it's just it's just that you so
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.760]   the easiest way to search when someone sends you a file is look for the all the emails from them
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.720]   with an attachment, but they all have attachments if you have an image in your signature. Exactly.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:47.040]   Now I can't find it. You're right. It's annoying as hell. There's no good reason for it. I mean,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.920]   my disc drive with little, you know, logos of companies that don't care about.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.960]   We don't care about any any of those images, just in case you're wondering if anyone's like listening
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.440]   who actually makes that decision stop. I heart radio does that the company that runs the premiere,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.560]   which runs my radio show. So all the email and get from Premiere. And then the worst one is there's
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:15.280]   a little GIF of a paperclip. I have eight thousand copies. You know that there were meetings about
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   that. There were meetings about that paperclip. They were they there were people who sat around
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.400]   and they had conference calls where they left their mic open. That's another pet pet peeve of mine.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.280]   You know, they had speaker phones. They had all that stuff and they all talked about it for
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.160]   weeks. And then they put a paperclip in their email thing that ruins everything for everybody.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:40.480]   Well, when I find historically funny about things like that and things like the the color of like
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.440]   a twist tie that comes with the comes with trash bags, everything that there is for every one of
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.960]   those little tiny things that seem kind of meaningless. There is somebody at some conference at some
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.040]   party saying that that was my baby. You know that I had a vision for the paperclip. And you know,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.480]   I had to fight some of the old squares about it. But I knew that I was right. I was I said,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:09.360]   Bob, if you if I don't win this one, I should just resign. Bob, what were Bobbi paperclips?
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.960]   One word. Hey, I met the guy. I met the guy. Remember AOL when they were sending out those
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.560]   CDs? You got like two a week, three a week. You met the guy. I thought that up. Yeah, that guy.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.920]   I didn't strangle him, but like you're the guy. How many dinosaurs died for that guy?
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.280]   I guess they were all dead already, but still I have stacks. I have stacks of CDs.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.760]   And I also want to curse Alex Lindsey because, well, actually, John Slanina should really curse
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.560]   you for this field runner's attack. John has sunk a significant portion of his total income into this.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:53.520]   You could have bought a house, John. Oh, he did. He bought a house. But it's fun. I really,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.680]   you know what, John, I played it last night to the wee hours of the morning. It is really fun.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.480]   No, I don't want this one time offer. I really enjoyed it for the times I played it. The problem
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.360]   is that all my playing time is on a plane, unconnected from the internet. And so it's been this kind of,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.920]   this is the bane of modern app gaming, isn't it? You can't play on Pochimon Go. You can't play on
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:20.720]   a plane. You can't play the new, what is the new hotness? Oh, Mario runner, you can't play on the
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:28.640]   game on the plane. Yeah. I was sitting on the plane trying to play a game. I did. I did feel
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:33.280]   very good, though. I picked a new level of the field runners to play for the next year. So that
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.920]   was one of my new years thing because I've been playing the same level for a year. And um,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.480]   the fact to level, you know, like, you know, for me, it's stressful to have to learn a new level.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   So I just get better and better and better. And so the key is you have to get to 200 level,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.000]   200 or 2 million points, whichever comes first in it, or even when you do that, you just keep on
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.800]   wanting to get better. And so, and then you do it without any of the little extras. So no freezes,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:05.040]   no mines, no, you know, you like to do it cleanly, you know, properly. You should hook yourself up to a
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   brain monitor while you're playing that because I'm thinking you're flatlining for most.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:19.680]   It's like, there's nothing going on. It's definitely is very relaxing for me. So it's,
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.040]   it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's not making huge changes. It's just making subtle details because
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.720]   it, you know, the best thing about field runners is that it's so predictable. And so you,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.240]   so you can sit there and figure, Oh, you know, I use this kind of tower the last time, but I'm
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.560]   going to change it up, you know, and, and there is, you know, and I'm going to figure out how to,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.400]   you know, manage your resources to make sure you don't. Anyway, it's, by the way, I did try to play
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:50.960]   Pokemon Go on the plane. It said you were going too fast. But you know, the reason why they have
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.440]   now, and I love it on the Apple Watch, you can play Pokemon Go on the Apple, Apple Watch. It'll
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.600]   notify you when you're near a Pokey Stop. It played on the Boston Common Sandy. I was about to say,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   you know, they made new laws about the phones for California, but not the watches.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   I think it counts. I do. I think it counts. I don't think it.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.120]   One of my most fun experiences with technology lifetime was a couple of weeks after Pokemon
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.760]   Go came out and I was in the common, just taking a walk. And I see it was, it was like a, like a
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.600]   hippie, like drum circle of like two, three, four dozen strangers. Just sort of like sitting the
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:32.400]   same place. And so, and actually, it was, I got my phone buzzed and the National Weather Service
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.960]   had an alert for like Boston, like actual downtown Boston involving hail and thunder and lightning.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.800]   And so I did. And so I felt as though as the, as the older person in this group, I summoned my
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.080]   coverage, suppressed my social anxiety. As I excuse players, can I have your attention, please?
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.520]   Please, please check the weather apps on your phone. The National Weather Service has announced
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.440]   a severe weather alert for this area in the next half hour involving hail and lightning.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.640]   So please check your weather apps and be safe. Thank you. Oh, that's awesome. And then, and then
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.680]   this young woman from the Brown acid. Okay.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.440]   You're a hero.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:21.440]   That is brave of you. I would not have done that.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.840]   I'm a life-sick. I probably killed the guy right now.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.720]   It would only offset part of what I did that day. I think the most, the most surreal
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.040]   Pokemon girl was when I was in, I was in the middle of the night, I was walking around Istanbul.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.880]   And it was the blue mosque, you know, this is one of the most incredible architectural
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.800]   at night. And there's like eight people wandering around this one area looking at their phone.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.280]   I realized they're in Istanbul looking, they found, because I looked, I looked, I
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.080]   guessed what it was. And of course, opened up Pokemon girl and it was like, yes, there's a
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.680]   stop being a pokey stop in the blue mosque. No. And it wasn't in it. It was outside in the yard,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.720]   you know, a little ways between some of the other mosques and the other things that are there.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.800]   And I was just like, that's crazy. Anyway, so the Hajiya Sophia has an incredible battle area
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.960]   there. You should go on over next time you're in Istanbul. Our show today brought to you by
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:17.280]   Blue Apron. Are you getting hungry? You will buy the end of this commercial Blue Apron's mission
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.960]   in life is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone while supporting a more
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.360]   sustainable food system, setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:33.200]   of home chefs. That's you. Blue Apron, you know, at the end of the day, you've worked hard. You don't
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.560]   the last thing you want to do, plan a meal, shop for a meal, go home, cook the meal.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.160]   So you end up at the Olive Garden once again. I know those breadsticks are good, but are they
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:47.520]   good for you? And do they give you a sense of making something for your friends and family that
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.000]   they're going to love? No, they don't. Blue Apron, when you see when you get home in that Blue Apron
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.760]   box is on your doorstep, refrigerated fresh ingredients from 150 local farms, fisheries,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.360]   and ranchers across the United States. Exactly what you need to make an amazing meal, actually
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.920]   three meals in the box, never always fresh, never frozen, even the meat and fish because they're
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.000]   refrigerated. They're really good. You get an easy to follow recipe card and you get a meal you
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.320]   can prepare in 40 minutes or less for less than 10 bucks per meal, which by the way is saving you
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.920]   money. Even if you shop for this at the grocery store, grocery stores about 60% more expensive than
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.760]   Blue Apron for the same exact ingredients. And that's because they don't have stores. They just,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.600]   you know, ship it to you. They save a lot of money that way. And Blue Apron delivers to 99%
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.280]   of the continental United States. So what I want you to do is go to Blue Apron.com/twit and look what's
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:42.720]   on the menu. They have plans for couples or two people or one person, two meals, and they have
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:48.000]   plans for families with kid-friendly ingredients. Steak and green, peppercorn sauce with kale and
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.280]   roasted potatoes are cod on papi yot. That's with the like, Philo dough, like, oh, and Frica and
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.800]   spinach. I don't even know what Frica is, but it sounds good. That's one thing. You get these new
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.560]   ingredients you've never tried that you will then use forever. It makes, oh, look at that.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.200]   Chicken souvlaki. I love souvlaki. Can you imagine making that yourself?
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:14.800]   Yes. Well, my wife started using Blue Apron. My daughter was like, "Mom, you are just the best
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   cook." Yes. That's something new. Yeah, don't be intimidated. You can do it. They walk you through
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.240]   it. Seared pork chops with pharaoh, brussel sprouts, and cranberry chutney. Now, you may say,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   "I don't want brussel sprouts." First of all, you don't have to use them, but also you can choose
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.800]   a menu item. They have a broad variety of menu items to choose from. You pick what you get,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.240]   and they don't repeat more than once a year. So you could always get something new and exciting,
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:43.280]   like potato and artichoke quiche with romaine and orange salad. They have vegetarian plans too.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.320]   You know what you're putting in there, and I really like that. You know what you're getting.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:55.840]   Blueapron.com/twitfamilies that use Blue Apron Cook together according to their research on average
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:02.800]   three times more often. I like that. Build strong bonds and a delicious meal. Blueapron.com/twit.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.320]   Oh, I didn't mention your first three meals are free. Now, how much would you pay?
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.800]   Your first three meals are free. Blueapron.com/twit.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:21.920]   Rumors? You want to do rumors? Lots of rumors. What are we going to see in 2017? They're due
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:31.120]   for Mac. I mean, iPad refreshes, right? We're going to see at the end of the year, I presume,
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:36.880]   a 10th anniversary iPhone. That's what I'm telling a lot of people to wait for, right? The 10th
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.360]   anniversary iPhone. I don't know though. I don't know if they'd be as eager to say,
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.920]   this is a 10th anniversary phone as opposed to this is simply the next iPhone.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.520]   Really? But look how awesome it is. They haven't traditionally been, hey, this is an
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:56.400]   anniversary product. I'm sure that they're going to spend a lot of time highlighting,
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.360]   it's a great opportunity to highlight their success in creating one of the most influential
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:08.320]   and mind-changing products ever to come out of technology and the heritage and the legacy of
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:16.000]   that brand. I'm not sure if they're going to call it an anniversary product so much as this is the
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.280]   iPhone 8. It would be interesting to see you. I don't know if Apple now has a rule of having the
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:31.120]   iPhone 7.0 and then the iPhone 7S and then the iPhone 8 and the 8S. But it would probably get a
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:37.760]   lot of people wondering if they had what some people are artificially anticipating as a 10th
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:44.160]   anniversary phone. And it is what some people would consider to be a talk release. It seems as though
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:51.680]   this is a part of the year where even if you've heard stuff that from people who are in the know
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.960]   and have told you reliable things, these are still things that are being debated and
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:03.440]   too sittered. But it does seem as though everything I've heard is not incremental stuff. It's real
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.120]   swing for the fences stuff and a bunch of that idea that we keep having a postpone for one reason
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.200]   or another that has nothing to do with our ability to actually factor it, let's absolutely do it
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:18.880]   this year. So I think it could be a very serious release. It could be a very serious release just
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:24.400]   by virtue of the fact that they can do a new version of the two cameras set up with a year's worth
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.440]   of additional knowledge of how people are using this feature and how well that feature is performing.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:35.520]   And they've also had their the Pixel phone is also probably that little
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:42.400]   goots to say that, oh, dang it, this really is a very, very good camera phone. And Android, a lot
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:48.960]   of times the differences between Android and an iPhone are not so much a case of Android doing
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:55.600]   something brilliant and revolutionary, but deciding that, oh, all this time we've had six bricks in
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.160]   the backpack were forced to carry. What if we were to take those bricks out of the backpack?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.960]   And now suddenly this, this simple phone is so much better. And one of the things they've changed
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:10.080]   for the Pixel is with a camera is that a lot of the things that made it not a not great camera
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.400]   that had nothing to do with the image quality have kind of been fixed. So I think they're going to,
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.440]   once again, they're going to be encouraged to do something great with the camera. But I think
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:24.560]   we're going to see the first really cool redesign of the front face of the device in years.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:32.720]   I would say they're due to do OLED, although it's going to be hard to get enough OLED screens to
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:38.240]   fulfill Apple's huge demand. Adam, you have any thoughts about what an iPhone 8 might?
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.640]   Yeah, I don't know. I do agree with Andy that the anniversary product seems unlikely. I mean,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.960]   the only one we really saw like that was the 20th anniversary Mac. And that was just weird.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:59.200]   It was a neat machine question, but it fit into the lineup very strangely. It was priced very high
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:07.440]   and then cut price cut radically low. And it feels like it's a little bit like I date myself.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.600]   But whenever years get put into product names and like illustrator 88,
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.960]   because that's the first one I remember this happening, you're automatically out of date as
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:25.600]   soon as it's not 1988 or whatever year it was. And so it feels to me like the anniversary product
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.240]   has a little bit of that problem too, that it's somehow always fixed in time a little bit more
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:37.040]   than it should be. So apart from that, honestly, I don't get too caught up in speculating
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:45.600]   about what's going to happen in iPhones. It feels to me like Apple has this list of
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:52.000]   features as long as they're arm and they've figured they've got five years in the future and
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.560]   they've got to keep coming up with something for each one of those releases. So they can't just
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.840]   blow all of them on one release. Yeah, it's just they're going to have to pick something that sounds
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.920]   interesting enough like the double cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus and pick that one for this release.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:17.520]   I think it's going to levitate. It's not going to require earphones at all. It's simply going to
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:24.080]   transmit directly to your eardrums. These are the things that I'm expecting. I will be disappointed
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.840]   and frustrated if I don't see those. One of the things that in the Android community,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:33.120]   many of these Android phones, including the pixels do is VR. Google has this daydream VR
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:40.000]   thing you put in the iPhones and Apple doesn't have any VR or AR. Do you think this will be one of
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.560]   the features of a new iPhone or is that not going to be a big deal next year? I think it's a great
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.960]   place for Apple to experiment with with with AR. You know, I think VR maybe I don't know if
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   that's a real significant thing for Apple. And also you can with cardboard, of course, use
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:02.640]   an iPhone right now with, you know, to do VR. I think that the the AR thing that needs to be
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:09.120]   kind of figured out is the fine tuned tracking. So right now, most of the tracking that we're
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.480]   seeing with AR is accelerometer based and positional based. And so it's trying to figure that stuff
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.640]   out. And as you notice, things kind of float, you know, over top of everything that you're doing.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.680]   There is, you know, another way to do that, which is to actually start doing pattern recognition
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.600]   and tracking of the of the information out there. And there's a couple people experimenting with
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:34.320]   that. And so that gets everything to kind of lock in on the on what it's seeing. So it grabs on
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.840]   the pixels that it's seeing and it makes sure that everything hangs to it. And when people
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   start doing more of that, it's a little more computationally expensive to do it. So it's
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.080]   it's going to take a little while for it to really get out there. But I think the processors are
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.920]   getting to the point where they could do that effectively. And it will change AR completely,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.560]   because all that floating and things kind of moving around like little floaters in your eyes,
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:03.760]   will hopefully largely go away. I really, I really think that Apple's first foray into AR is not
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.800]   going to be, Hey, here's our new platform, or even here's our new set of API's. It really is just
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.960]   going to be here is the new version of maps. Oh my God, we made an amazing change to that for you.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.320]   And that's going and then maybe a couple years later, we will see some of the technology leak out
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.640]   into other products and to other APIs. But think that that's an area where if they do all that in
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.520]   house, they control everything themselves, they can really when they want to release it. And they
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.440]   don't have to define the experience for other people. I think that that's where they're going to
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.760]   go with it. I think it's a great same thing. I mean, the uh-huh moment for my, for my wife,
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.560]   you know, I we kind of an argument over the weekend, not a bad argument. But we I said,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.400]   oh, that's that's Venus. And she goes, that's definitely not Venus. And I just pulled up this guy,
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.480]   the sky happened. I just pointed up and I go, no, that's Venus.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:54.160]   You know, but but the idea that it would just suddenly show you all the stars that were up there.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.200]   Oh, what's this good is she was like, oh my God, that is amazing. You know, she that's really good.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.560]   Well, as a matter of fact, I happen to have right here. Yeah, it was, you know, the new tool to just
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.280]   show that you're right. So, um, by the way, how'd that go for you? Did that win the argument or did
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.920]   you just, she was actually just she was just she had not really seen any VR, you know,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.160]   it's not something she uses on her phone. And so she was, uh, fortunately she was just, you know,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.960]   not angry with me for being a dork. Um, and instead was impressed by the technology,
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.520]   which doesn't happen very often. Very, very lucky man. It was close. It was close. It was close.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.120]   She clearly she read what was printed on the package that you came in before she took it off the shelf.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.680]   I missed, I missed the bullet by, you know, I quickly looked over and look at how great that
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:45.040]   house is. Let's get that Alex has a shrink wrap, uh, license around him. Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.960]   And you, the Yula.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:54.880]   Yula. Yeah. All right. What about, uh, we'll see new iPads. I presume.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:01.200]   Spring, I think this spring. Yeah. Anything. What can you do? I mean, this is the same problem
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.040]   really Apple has with the iPhone is what can you do to improve either product? I mean, what,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.960]   what big changes could you make? You can, you can add pencil support to the iPad mini.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:18.640]   You can add the new really wonderful, uh, color, color display to, so we make it, uh,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:25.280]   line wide instead of restricted to just the nine point seven inch iPad. There are a lot of
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:30.720]   little things that they can do. Right now, I think most of most of their efforts in the iPad
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.280]   are going to be and making sure they're developing a device that people actually want. I think the
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.680]   iPad is the most brilliant piece of hardware that Apple has right now. The thing that really shows
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:45.040]   up everything like that though. Yeah, but I don't think, I think it's selling like that among
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:52.160]   tablets, among, uh, among the iPads, like devices, uh, right now it's not really convincing a lot of
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:59.520]   people to spend, uh, 600, 600, 700 dollars on nine point seven inch iPad pro instead of the
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.320]   same amount of money on a cheap, uh, Windows laptop with a touchscreen. Uh, but it's definitely,
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.960]   it's iOS, which is where Apple really wants to, wants to put most of their money, it seems, uh,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.880]   in the near future. Uh, and the mo, the more they can do to convince people that this is not just
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.800]   like a, an ebook reader device, it really is competitive with anything that is sold with the
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Windows logo on it for less than a thousand dollars. I think that's stuff that they're really
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.920]   going to be eager to, to take advantage of and pencil support is definitely going to be either
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.880]   for that. Yeah. I think that, I think one of the things obviously moving to USB-C hopefully, um,
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.440]   you know, the, the, one of the big problems for the iPad is it's in this weird, no way to,
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.040]   not a lot of easy ways to interface data, you know, other outputs and so on, so forth into it. I
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.680]   think making that a little easier would, would help a lot. Um, I do think pencil support across
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.720]   the platform. I think that one of the things I'd love to see in an eye, you know, an iPhone 8
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.080]   is pencil support, you know, so you can take little notes and draw a little things and
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:02.720]   annotate things. Does that mean it's a mini pro? Sorry. Is that a mini pro? Correct. Yeah.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:09.920]   Yeah. Yeah. I think that I think that it would be, um, I think that those, those kinds of things
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.760]   could help a lot. I think one of the problems really is is that a lot of the software for the
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.440]   iPad and I think this might be, uh, I don't know exactly where it is, but I've been thinking
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.360]   about a lot watching my kids. My kids don't really care which iPad they play with. Um, you know,
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.520]   they, they have access to, you know, a wide range and the ones that they travel with are
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.520]   ones that are like two or three versions ago and they're cracked and there's pieces of them
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:34.160]   chipping off and they're quite happy just to sit there and do their thing on them. Um, and, uh, and
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.800]   so I think that part of the problem is the software, the new software that people have been developing,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.040]   that Apple's been developing, isn't really properly taking full advantage of the process
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.040]   or where it's impressive enough to update. So I don't think that it's necessarily that not people
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:52.800]   aren't, um, buying iPads. They're just not upgrading them as fast because there's not the software
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.080]   doesn't feel there's not that much software out there that feels like it's lagging because you
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.000]   don't have a fast enough iPad. And so if you risk almost there for no spinning rainbow cursor,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.240]   right? Yeah. And there's, and there's definitely software out there that could push it, but, but
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:13.440]   people aren't, you know, developing it enough. And I think that this is, this gets into, again, I,
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.480]   you know, I think Apple has had very much of a, if we build it, they will come, uh, kind of attitude
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.800]   about a lot of these things. And sometimes it might take a little bit of, uh, you know, generation,
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.640]   you know, to get people moving forward. You know, they, they have, you know, the, um, the, the,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.880]   they're, they're, uh, you know, uh, swift playground is, is really amazing, but they really, you know,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.200]   could afford to spend some money on paying a lot of people to develop a lot of content for it,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.400]   you know, to get people excited. Same thing with iBooks, same thing with, you know,
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.040]   there's some great technologies out there and of course they do WWDC, but I think that there
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.840]   could be a lot more aggressive, um, you know, development of the ecosystem of the platform
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.520]   that might be even funded by Apple to, um, kind of that would, that would pay off in hardware sales.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.640]   If there are people were able to fully take advantage of, uh, the hardware and, and were,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:07.280]   you know, pushed a little harder to do it. From my perspective, and I'm not, uh, I'm not a big iPad
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:13.360]   guy. I might use an iPad to watch Netflix occasionally and read books occasionally and frankly, that's
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.880]   about it. Um, and it's just, it's a, it's a form factor that really doesn't do much for me. I don't
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:24.400]   play games and if I'm going to browse the web, it's just always better on a big screen. And so it
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:30.000]   feels to me as though if Apple wants the iPad Pro to really go somewhere, there needs to be,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:39.200]   two things. One is, um, iOS is just, that sandbox is just, it prevents so many possibilities that
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:45.120]   I want to, I want to do something that an app won't do. And then I can't do it at all. You know,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.040]   they, that on the Mac, I usually put stuff together. I have several apps that work together. I can
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.360]   move data back and forth very quickly and easily. So there's, there's something in the iOS that
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:58:00.400]   just seems kind of antithetical to tasks that are not highly specific and this can be completely
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.440]   solved by one app. And then the other thing is, you know, you look at the Microsoft, uh, Surface
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:13.360]   Studio, big honkin screen. And that would be really fascinating to see Apple do an iPad for. I mean,
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.440]   I, you know, that's something where I would have to, you'd still have to have something going on on
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:23.520]   the app side so that you could use multiple apps together very fluidly to be able to do things that
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.000]   any one app will not do. But once you get that extra screen real estate and, and, and the ergonomics
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.680]   that go there, I mean, part of it is I don't use an iPad because I work standing up, you know,
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   it's kind of hard to do with looking standing up. And it just feels as though there's, there's,
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.640]   there's a couple of kind of sticking points in the current form factor in the current iOS and
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.320]   iOS really throughout time.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:58.000]   I do. Do you think part of the problem Apple's facing this really goes to a much larger philosophical
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.720]   question of part of the problem Apple's facing is the inevitable, uh, abandonment of the Macintosh
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.440]   for a touch first operating system for iOS and some future iPad. I mean, you're complaints are
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.680]   exactly right. You can't do a lot of the stuff you want to do on an iPad. So you do use it on the
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.040]   Mac, but it isn't Apple really shouldn't Apple really at this point be thinking, all right,
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.960]   how do we transition from the Mac to the iPad and make everybody be used the iPad?
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.040]   So, so, so I do think, I mean, because I actually have written about this fairly recently,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.600]   I don't think that Apple really sees a transition as coming really anytime soon.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:41.680]   And the reason is that the Mac has now become an iPhone or iOS accessory
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:48.640]   that it's still a $22 billion product, but it's an accessory for God's sake. That's when you do
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:54.160]   your development. You know, I mean, isn't that scary thought? If you think about it, that's where
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:59.200]   handoff comes in. It's so you can switch to your Mac to finish off the test. And you, of course,
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.760]   started on your iPhone. Now I never do that. That's a stupid idea. But that's the way Apple's
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.480]   thinking about it. And so as long as you kind of keep that in mind, a whole lot of stuff makes
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.440]   sense. Like, I don't even get to this, but they, they screwed up PDF, PDF kit.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.840]   We are going to get to this because you're this is a big deal for you. Yeah.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.680]   They want they want it to be the same between iOS and Mac OS, but they're not the same platforms,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.040]   right? So, you know, on Mac OS, you're doing much more involved PDF stuff with annotations and editing
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.440]   and text layers and all this kind of stuff. It doesn't happen in iOS, particularly. And gee,
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.480]   is it a big surprise that it's a real problem on the Mac? And it's no one said boo about an iOS 10.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:44.720]   So, you know, Mac and Mac OS isn't going away because we need it. Everyone needs it. The ecosystem
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:51.360]   needs it, but it needs it as a supporting actor. Well, but your problems with PDF on the Mac are
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.680]   kind of, don't you think a indicator that Apple is thinking, how do we make this all iOS?
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.040]   Ultimately, absolutely. And they're doing it badly. In this case, I mean, the QA was completely
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:10.160]   lacking. So what happened? So, so in Sierra, Apple completely rewrites the PDF kit framework,
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.800]   the library, the library, and behind the scenes that does all this stuff for developers.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.480]   And the first stuff we heard about it, you probably remember this when, when Sierra first came out,
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.840]   the scan snap Fujitsu, the scan snap people say, whoa, big problems. Don't upgrade, don't upgrade.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.760]   And it took a while to figure out why. And then that actually got fixed in 10.2.1.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.640]   But scan snap is a scanner that's intended for scanning receipts and other, you know, quick pieces
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.920]   of paper and turn it's a document scanner. It turns into a PDF. And they're in lines, the problem.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.360]   They're in lines, the problem. And they were having and they took them a long time to even
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.800]   figure out what the problems were because it turns out they were pretty subtle where they weren't
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.640]   nearly as severe as initially thought. But so it, the problem was not that scan snap was doing
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.680]   anything wrong. It was that PDF kit, this, the underlying framework, which the apps rely on from
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:04.720]   Apple had changed completely and lost features. I mean, they Apple deprecated a bunch of stuff.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:10.240]   This was confirmed by Devin Think and Michael Sy, who is a very well known long time Mac developer
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.840]   does a thing called Eagle, Eagle Filer developer after developers complaining about this.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.480]   Yeah. Well, and didn't it affect mostly the developers who had actually relied on the Apple
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   substructure rather than writing their, if you use the third party one, which is usually what
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.280]   you get recommended not to do is to, you know, use something third party where you end up falling
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.960]   behind. They actually, if they leaned on Apple to do that for them, they're the ones that are
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.280]   really paying the price, right? But these things happen, don't they? I mean, you're supposed to
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:45.600]   rely on Apple's kits, WebKit and all of this PDF kit to do low level stuff. So you don't have to
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.360]   rewrite it, rewrite it yourself. And Apple's supposed to keep it up to date, but Apple from
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.880]   time to time and every company, this happens, this happens with DirectX and everything else.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.480]   Every company will make modifications and unwittingly cause problems for developers, but they get
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.720]   fixed, don't they? Well, we haven't gotten fixed in 10 to one and 10 to two and 10 to two introduced
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   a new bad one, where if you edit a PDF in preview that we had an OCR text layer, it deletes the
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.160]   text layer. Who needs that? Oh, that's not good. Apple or here's another one I just found out about
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.760]   this today in preview, open up any PDF, use the rectangular selection, make draw the rectangular
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   selection, and then command C. The whole thing just goes completely. I mean, just selecting text
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.880]   stuff to stuff in a PDF destroys it. I mean, this is this is like a total failure of QA. And you could
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.920]   argue that it's a failure of shipping it too soon, whatever. But the fact is they broke a whole lot
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.400]   of stuff that a lot of apps rely on. And these are real apps. These are productivity apps. These
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.720]   are apps that people rely on to get their work done. Now you obviously do a lot of PDF work
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:59.360]   because of your publications. Are you saying even Apple's own preview program has these problems?
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.880]   Yes. Fewer of them, Michael Tsai was saying that he's actually tracked down some of the bugs that
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.520]   he's run into and tried to reproduce in preview. And he thinks the preview team knows about these
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.480]   and has worked around them in preview, some of them in preview, rather than get PDF kit fixed,
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.760]   because other people are hitting ones that preview should be hitting. But preview does have
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.480]   plenty of its own problems as well. So you have said don't use, in fact, you said this yesterday,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.280]   don't use preview to edit PDFs. I can't recommend it right now until
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.640]   that until it's done. Because you can corrupt your existing PDF by doing so.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.240]   Yes. I mean, if you've got an OCR text layer, it's gone. I mean, so like when you
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:44.720]   scan a document, right, you get a picture of the document. But there's a common engine as Abbey
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.680]   Fine Raider, which lies on PDF stuff, PDF kit, everything like that. It comes with a lot of
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:55.120]   scanners. Yeah. And so it does an OCR and makes a text layer. So PDF is one of those sort of
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.880]   layered documents where you've got the graphic layer and the text layer on top. And so that
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.800]   allows you to search, for instance, because you're searching text, not trying to search an image.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.000]   And when you do this, you do some editing on the PDF in preview, it just deletes the text layer.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.280]   And is this is it your sense that this is because of a complete rewrite of PDF kit or
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.680]   how did these bugs get introduced? They started from scratch.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.400]   Start from scratch. There was there was there's a guy well, well regarded developer who I
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.680]   shouldn't name because I don't know if I'm supposed to know this who wrote the original one
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.120]   long time ago for Apple actually left Apple came back to Apple, but isn't on that team anymore.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:40.080]   And and apparently that you know, everyone liked his code. And so PDF kit previously was thought
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.400]   to be an elegant solution. And but it was not presumably iOS savvy, having been written so long
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.120]   ago. And so that's why they decided to rewrite it. And that's again, not a bad thing. Just make
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.440]   sure the bugs are out and that it does the same stuff as the old one did. Chuck Van Rosseback,
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.200]   former Apple employee was guy has been very outspoken about Apple said parody with iOS took
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:06.640]   priority over backward compatibility. And that's what happened with iWork. It's what happened with
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:16.080]   photos with iMovie. So you recommend using PDF pen smile. Of course, there's been a sponsor
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.800]   the show for a long time. And that is a good product. They don't have the same problems because
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.240]   they're using their they're not using PDF kit. That's correct. However, as Greg Scown pointed
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.520]   out when I asked him about it, they're getting complaints from their customers because their
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.120]   customers send a PDF to someone else, touches it with preview and destroys it. So I use preview
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.720]   all the time. I mean, this is what I so this is these frameworks are critical to the continued
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.120]   use of Macintosh. These are really important frameworks because not because because they're
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.400]   just not used by one program. They're used by many, many programs. Yes. And that's the thing. I mean,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.200]   and here's the thing that we also don't see, which is that users might not run into every one of
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.440]   these problems, right? I mean, unless you do something that hits the problem in a particular app or the
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.320]   app has to actually cut a feature out. So the bookends guy said he had to take PDF annotations
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.840]   out of the product because it couldn't they didn't work. And so we'll see that. But the thing is,
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.480]   what you don't see behind the scenes is this slows down the entire ecosystem as all developers scramble
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:23.040]   for months to figure out these bugs, report the bugs, work around the bugs if they can, or
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.000]   deal with them if they can't, plus all the support issues. So I mean, this is something that Apple's,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.400]   you know, rock in the pond has huge, huge ripples that go out across the ecosystem to both developers
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.360]   and users. This reminds me a little bit of the problems Apple's had with iCloud's document
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:45.280]   syncing to the point where people just stopped or refused to use it. Did Apple ever fix that?
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.800]   I think it's gotten better, honestly, but I don't know if I mean, it may have been one of those
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.240]   things a little bit sort of too little too late because so many people had already reengineered
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.560]   their own solutions. So I have not followed up with any of those people who'd gone and done their
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.880]   own thing to see if they went back and checked if the problems were resolved. Well, maybe this
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.920]   that may be the same thing that happens to PDF kit at this point is to. And that would be
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.640]   yeah, that'd be problematic in some ways. It's been one of the strengths of the Apple ecosystem
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:18.880]   is you have this built in PDF handling capability. On a PC, you have to download
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.640]   Acrobat Reader. And I mean, it's just it's a mess. And a lot of people rely on the PDF kit.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.240]   And PDF is one of those things that you don't think about how baked in it is. But you know,
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.720]   nowadays with the browsers, for instance, being able to do PDF internally, you don't even think
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.040]   if you click a PDF link, it just loads, you just read it, you move on, you know, all those kinds of
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.720]   things you download a PDF, you can edit it, there's forms, you know, text layers, it all frankly just
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   works for the most part in preview. I mean, I wrote a book about preview for the six previews,
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.400]   actually a pretty good app. You know, and so it does a lot of stuff for free that people don't
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.880]   realize with PDF and graphics and everything. But, you know, when you can't recommend something
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.240]   that corrupts data, sorry, it's just it's corrupting data. Not okay.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.920]   Andy, it wasn't it wasn't it you who's not so long ago was talking about all the things you could
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.160]   do with preview that people didn't know about. I think it was you. Yeah, it really is a Swiss
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.520]   army knife. There are a lot of one step things I need to do to modify images or deal with PDFs or
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.400]   convert something from one format to another. And rather than launch something expensive,
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.040]   you launch preview that's optimized, it's really fast, as compact is free and it's there.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.440]   So if you hate to see anything, a cripple preview in any way, because it's such a critical app.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:44.240]   So this is this kind of, I mean, I don't want to necessarily couple it to Apple needing to move to
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:51.040]   iOS. It's related to but but it just sounds like it's a bug. It's a problem. They got to fix it.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.880]   The team that rewrote it, you know, you read when you rewrite from scratch, you
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.440]   enter you're going to have these things happen is you were replacing something been in use for 10,
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.600]   15, 20 years with something brand new. You're not going to have it.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.360]   Polish. Go ahead, Alex. Yeah. I guess I would say that I still think that, you know, as I've said,
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.600]   for a long time, I think we're looking at a slow unification of the two O.S.s. And and I think that
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.000]   you know, we're going to keep on seeing these as they keep on closing the gap between the two. I
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.480]   think that you see iOS getting a little bit more of something that Mac OS has and a lot of Mac OS
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   getting stuff that iOS has. I don't think they're going to maintain two O.S.s forever.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.320]   And I think that, you know, what we're seeing are compatibility issues as they sort those
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.880]   issues out over the next couple of years. Yeah, I definitely think we're seeing evidence that
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   Apple has an idea of one type of machine they want to make or one type of computer.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.920]   And I really do think that my complaints about the new Mac book
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   are best articulated as they seem to be trying to make the entire MacBook line more palatable to
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:02.080]   a iPad user. If we can't sell them an iPad Pro, we can make the Mac, the Mac, the MacBook line
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:10.800]   more slim, more light, more pairing it down to one port for charging and data. And that's it.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.960]   And that's where we go to. If Apple has decided that that's where they have to be,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.680]   to retain their stature in the industry, then well, I hope it works for them. I don't know if it's a
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:31.280]   great model or if it's a path towards maintaining their status as a great company, but they can do
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:40.880]   that. And Gardner in your chatroom points out that moving to Mac OS to an iOS is going to really
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:48.320]   be a problem because of fundamental incompatibilities between APIs. And if you're having trouble with
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   PDFs, he says, good luck merging incompatible UI kits, for instance. That's good. That's much
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:02.640]   more of a challenge than just rewriting PDF kit. Well, let's take him now and I'm depressing.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:12.240]   I'm trying to be cheerful. AirPods are really nice.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.160]   Except for that weird thing with the sound and the battery life.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:28.800]   These days, I feel like every time we talk about Apple for any extent, it's like the movie
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:36.720]   cabaret where it will start off with fun and gayity and sex and glitter. And then it always ends with
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.880]   tomorrow we belong belongs to me in a slow pan. I'm just ordered images of Nazis.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.440]   He just got to end it after when he makes the world go around. And that's it.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:56.560]   And also, let's be fair. This is what happens. There's a cycle for tech companies like any
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:03.120]   other company. And it's hard to be high-flying for a long time. Apple's really kind of already
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.880]   beat the odds by having two great successes. First with the Apple II and the Macintosh and
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.680]   then Steve leaves, then Steve comes back and the company has a second great success with the
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:23.520]   iPhone and the iPad. That's very unusual to expect Apple to continue on that trajectory is,
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.400]   frankly, unrealistic. We want it to. We wish it will. We wish it would.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:35.120]   But I mean, if you can't sit here on the sidelines and watch what's happening and not say something.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.440]   Now, and especially when it comes to a situation like this PDF stuff where users need to know
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.920]   A, avoid certain products, B, be aware of certain activities.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:52.400]   As see, provide feedback to Apple. Tellapple, apple.com/feedback. Tell them that this is a
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.240]   problem for you. This is causing you to not be able to do your work.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.040]   That's what will get their attention. Hopefully. Because that doesn't nothing well.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:11.600]   I agree. I agree. Because I think it's fair to say we all love Apple and we all love Macintosh.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.360]   And we are all really excited to keep iOS going. So there's a lot of good here.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.400]   Let's focus on what needs to be fixed and move forward. We all want new ponies from Apple.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.920]   Let's face it. You know what? I'm willing to say at this point, we don't need a new pony.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:32.080]   Just keep the old pony going. Right. Yeah. That's fair. That's like we want a good pony that
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.120]   really does what it's supposed to do. And maybe this is a little bit our fault because we do demand
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.640]   of Apple. What's the new iPhone going to be? What's the new Mac? I will settle for Apple just like
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.520]   no longer cutting legs off of the pony to make it lighter. That's good for me. You know,
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:53.280]   I'll be satisfied. Here's something I'll suggest, which is perhaps this is the problem with
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.440]   Mac OS updates going free. It's a free update. Well, just everyone should have it. It'll come out
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.960]   on our schedule. It'll have what we feel like having in it. Tough nuggies. You don't have to pay
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.160]   for it. Back when you buy the way this is the this is where Microsoft's going with Windows,
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.800]   by the way, exactly this free updates for life. Yeah. So let's hope this isn't a recipe for disaster.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.440]   Well, but there's a question there. I mean, it's sort of the same thing developers run into,
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.440]   right? Where if you charge for an update, those are your customers. You have to persuade them to
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:31.200]   pay you again. And if you can't come up with something for your customers to pay you again,
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.520]   well, that's hardware, right? That's hardware. That's what drives up software too. Well, software
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.600]   is in as big a business for Apple as hardware. Hardware is sure. I'm just suggesting it's the
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.160]   attitude that that doesn't have to win our our our loyalty and respect over and over again.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:57.200]   Company, especially a tech company in this day and age, just say, we're done. We've made the
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.680]   perfect product. We're just going to keep making it. And when it wears out, you should get a new one.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.920]   Period. Do they need to touch? I think the touch bar is an example of pushing too hard to innovate.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:16.080]   I think the the the tube, the Mac Pro tube, an example of taking something that was perfect
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.440]   and trying too hard to make something different and new. I think taking the headphone jack out,
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.120]   I love the iPhone seven. If it had a headphone jack, it'd be perfect.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.720]   So, you know, I think that's an interesting thing. Companies in the tech industry just say,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.000]   no, we made a perfect product. We're done. Yeah, we're going to keep putting new processors in it as
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.600]   new and if you say that, you say that we're getting off the rat race, we're getting out of the rat
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.680]   race. We're not going to try to do these huge updates. These are big updates every year,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.640]   like clockwork, because it's good. We're just going to keep them, you know, we tweak it in bug fixing.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.680]   I mean, not like there aren't thousands and thousands of bugs and all this software.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.920]   Just keep tweaking, keep improving. And it's solving the problems we need. The only thing is,
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.600]   they've got to figure out a way to get new customers. And is that good enough for new customers?
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.440]   Because that's what they've all gone. Everything has gone to attracting new customers. That's
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.160]   what the free updates for life. Only interesting new customers.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.440]   I think the auto industry went through this in the 50s where they thought, oh, we got to,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.640]   we all do all these Chrome and fins and stuff. And finally, they kind of realized in BMW and
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.200]   Mercedes, just kind of year in year out, we're just going to make it incrementally better. And
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.880]   maybe in 10 years, there's something really cool we got to put in. But
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.520]   I think the auto industry is an example of a mature industry that got it. And every 10 years,
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.680]   somebody will buy a new car. We don't need you to buy a new car every year or every two.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.720]   The average car stays on the road for 11 years.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.360]   Yeah. And I think stability for most people in their lives, especially with this kind of thing,
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:52.720]   is more important than new features. Sometimes that gets lost. I now have a phone that crashes.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.920]   And that's the one thing that Steve Jobs was, that was a big deal, was like,
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.120]   we're not going to put a bunch of crazy features in here because you still have to use your phone.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.080]   So that's the kind of, I think that that is one of the things that we lose is progressing so quickly
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:16.000]   that we get behind it. And of course, there's a lot of manufacturers have kind of a development
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.360]   curve that's going to, and Apple does too, I'm sure, that goes out eight, 10 years of kind of
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.080]   where they're trying to slowly nudge people towards some goal. And so a lot of these are here.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.560]   But I do think that going to slow means somebody else makes you look bad because you look like
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.480]   you're moving slow and going too fast. Everyone complains that they don't have a mag safe.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:41.360]   Yeah. Yeah. And it's really endemic in the tech industry, especially. And you see
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.120]   Intel's having all sorts of problems because they can't really innovate.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.280]   Trying to run into physics. Yeah, physics. So, I think part of it is that muscles only
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.520]   only develop when you have a force to push against. And when you feel as though you're selling the
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.760]   the most successful high margin financially successful products in the world,
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.000]   it's hard to say that I've got a problem that we desperately need to solve where
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.080]   we're ordering in Chinese food. We're going to sit here in this room for two days till we figure
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.520]   out how to do this. It's always Apple. Apple couldn't have done what they did if had they not
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:21.680]   been completely on the ropes. And in a sense, desperate enough to say what the hell let's do
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.640]   what let's do whatever Microsoft was in exactly that same position. When they finally got rid of
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.040]   Ballmer and they said, look, we don't want to be like IBM. We don't want to just be a consultancy
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.240]   firm. We really want to continue to have a role to play in the future technology. And that's going
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:42.000]   to mean doing things that are kind of ridiculous on the face of it, but lead us into better things.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.160]   So, it's I don't know what the solution is for Apple. I just don't think that they're
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.480]   I'm not I'm sorry. I'm not seeing evidence in their product line that they are really,
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.360]   really eager to challenge themselves and put themselves at great risk. I think that they
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.680]   say see that safety cushion underneath them of all the profits they're making from the other
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:07.520]   product lines. And they say, well, you know, let's we'll we'll we'll we'll dally about with making a
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.960]   solid gold watch. We'll dally about with doing these kind of weird looking computers, but we're
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.520]   not going to do the thing that two years we are okay with always being the company that has to
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:24.480]   answer the question. Well, Apple, why aren't you making a product like that? We are no longer the
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.680]   company that is really geared towards making other companies feel the pressure of, God, why didn't
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.960]   we make something like the iPhone? Yeah. Let's take a break. Andy and I co Chicago,
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.600]   sometimes pithy. Brilliant and restarting his machine.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:45.920]   We and we know there is sound is great. There's some video issues. So you can
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:51.680]   we'll restart. Andy and I co is of course from the Chicago Sun times from the pixel core.com.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:21:00.640]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, a L E X L I N D S A Y on the Twitter. Don't send him signatures
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.480]   with him. No, you can send signatures. Just don't ask me if I got the attachment. That's all I'm
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:13.680]   saying is I did it was a paper clip. And if you do send it, don't send a PDF to Adam Anks to tidbits
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.800]   because he can't open it.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:20.080]   The world delete half of it accidentally delete the text layer tidbits.com.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:26.560]   But they still put out a great publication. E books take control series and of course the
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.800]   world famous longest running and best it's wrong. It's right because it's the best
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:36.880]   Mac and touch newsletter. We can tidbits.com not just Mac all Apple. Our show today brought to
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:44.000]   you by Squarespace. It's a new year. It's a new Squarespace. Make your next move known to the world
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.720]   with the best platform for your website with a new year comes new resolutions, new ideas, new goals,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.520]   whether you're starting a business changing careers or launching a creative project, you know,
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:02.160]   there's nowhere better than Squarespace. It makes it makes it easy to create a professional
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.720]   website beautiful looking, but with underlying engineering technology that is state of the art.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:16.160]   And I really want to emphasize that it's it's design plus great engineering and great hosting
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:23.760]   that make your site sing. Whether you need a portfolio for your, your, your photography business
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:31.120]   or your artwork, whether you need a, you want a professional blog, an online store. It's all in
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.280]   there in your Squarespace website. Multiple templates. This is new. I didn't know this and I'm going to
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.720]   try it out. They've always improving stuff. Multiple templates now on a single website. So you can
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:48.000]   have multiple designs at the same time. And the designs people want, you know, the state of the
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.840]   art, modern stuff like the grid style landing pages, very, you know, it's all the rage now.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.720]   But you can do it without having to be a designer without having to be an engineer. It's all built
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:03.520]   in. They've got infinite scroll related posts built in mobile, of course, on every site, which means
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:13.520]   your site looks great on any size screen from a 55 inch living room TV to a five inch iPhone 4
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.120]   Squarespace makes it work. Actually, the effort for us with three and a half inches. Plus, if you're
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.800]   doing commerce, every Squarespace template comes with commerce built in. It's the only platform
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:27.440]   that lets you create, manage, and brand your store in a beautiful way. It doesn't look like
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.800]   something an add on an afterthought. Your store fits the look and feel of the rest of your site,
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.440]   which is awesome. In a free custom domain with an annual purchase, they have now Squarespace
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.000]   domains. In fact, if you want to get a new domain, go to Squarespace domains, register your domain,
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.080]   and they get you a beautiful clean spam free parking page until you're ready to start building.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.480]   I am so happy I moved my blog to squarespace.com. And I want you to do the same. Make your next
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.760]   move. You can try it free at squarespace.com. All I ask if you buy, use the offer code MAC break.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:11.440]   That way you'll get 10% off squarespace.com. Make your next move with squarespace.com.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:18.800]   Still the best. We're talking, let's see, did Andy get back on good?
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.760]   And we'll see if that fixes the ellipseink and stuttering issues.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.560]   I think you're using the iOS for Skype now. Or the Skype for iOS, whatever it is.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:36.800]   No, no, this is the, since I wasn't using this computer for two whole weeks for any podcast,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.320]   whatsoever, I moved it to the living room. And so I have the usual sanitation that I,
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.520]   procedures that I use were not applied. So perhaps this will fix things.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:54.320]   You are not like those parents who are suing, saying FaceTime caused their daughter's death.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:02.560]   The driver of their car that crashed into their daughter killing her was using FaceTime while he
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:11.840]   was driving, going 65 miles an hour on Interstate 35, North of Dallas. Very tragic, sad, sad story.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:20.160]   Please, folks, don't use FaceTime when you drive. I've seen people read books while they're driving.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:28.560]   I actually had a, in Peru, the, like the CapTractor was watching a TV show and texting
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.920]   while driving me back to my, at two o'clock in the morning, I was just like,
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.520]   I just hope I may, can I just hope I may, can I just hope I make it? However,
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.680]   suing apples going a little far. They say though that apples should install and implement
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.960]   a design that locks out FaceTime while somebody's driving, which is certainly doable. In fact,
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.640]   we're starting to see the NTHSA, I think, never get the acronym straight, the National Highway
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:58.320]   Transportation and Safety Administration or whatever, is now recommending that all phones have software
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.920]   that prevents people from doing this kind of thing, texting, I guess FaceTime included, while they're
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:09.200]   operating in a certain, you know, above whatever it is, 10 miles an hour. It'd be easy thing to do.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   You know how fast the car is going. Yeah, but how do you know if you're behind the wheel?
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.400]   Well, I mean, I think that's the question. I mean, I don't think everybody not,
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.800]   I'm not able to use the, the way ZEP does something like this, where it basically has a
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.720]   dead man switch that says that if you try to operate it while, like, type in an address to go to
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.680]   while the car is in motion, it will say, yeah, you're not allowed to do that unless you're a
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:36.560]   passenger. If your passenger tapped this button, I'll let you do that, but that's a no-go.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.280]   So at least at some point, you, I don't know how that would solve a legal liability, if there is
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.880]   any sort of legal liability on Apple's part. But it is true that there could be a way to,
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:53.280]   it's, I wish that there were, for instance, something like a way to lock out messages so that you can
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.520]   just create an app, an Android, there are apps you can install that basically, when you have a
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.480]   do not disturb mode, when you're driving, it will automatically respond to any text with,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.160]   I'm sorry, I'm in the car right now, but as soon as I've stopped, as soon as I've had my
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.280]   destination, I will read and reply to your text. And it will, you never even see the text message
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.520]   because that's what the app is designed to do. It'd be nice if there was some way to do that,
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:23.920]   so that that's a default action. So the person has to be even more wilfully stupid and ignorant
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.560]   and careless than the normal person who texts or face times while they drive.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.440]   But Google's kind of living in that direction. Google Auto now will launch automatically on my
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:40.800]   pixel if I'm driving and put me into a much more constrained mode with just a few buttons and
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.960]   stuff like that. I think that's Google's way of trying to avoid this. This isn't Apple's only--
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.440]   The voice had a special car mode, and you can even install a separate app,
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.400]   the third-party app, that's a car dashboard style app, not even a Google Auto, but yeah,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   that's the same thing. There are Apple apps that do third-party apps. There's no
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.520]   Apple app that does that, but there's just third-party apps that do that.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.520]   This isn't the only lawsuit against Apple, there's also a class action suit involving text messaging.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.720]   The reason, by the way, is because it is a problem now. California just passed a very
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.720]   stringent law that went into effect this year that says you can't even touch, you can touch the
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.360]   phone twice. You can't pick it up, you can't hold it, and you can only touch it twice for any reason
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:30.560]   at all. The reason is we're seeing fatalities rising at a rate unprecedented in 50 years.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:39.360]   Much of it is distracted driving clearly. I think it's significant because now we're starting to
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:45.840]   see the first wave of new drivers who grew up with text messaging and grew up with Facebook and
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.800]   grew up with social media because it's so ingrained into their means of communication that it's hard
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:57.840]   for them to see an option of not using it. I think we need to hit kids with a bigger stick in this
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.400]   particular instance. Former general of the National Transportation Safety Board, Deborah
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.200]   Hirschman, says, "The technology exists. We just don't have the stomach to implement it."
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:14.560]   The national consensus is rapidly moving that way. I think it's going to push demand dramatically
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:20.640]   towards driverless cars. People are really going to want to not... What's going to happen now,
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.800]   you've got a lot of people that are very used to interacting, and they've been slowly pushed away
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.120]   from it. What happens is that people are less and less interested in their car when it's getting
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:37.200]   in literally in the way of interacting with everyone. I think that the demand for autonomous cars is
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:42.400]   going to, as all these laws become more and more stringent, people are going to more and more want
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.640]   not to have to deal with the car. They want to get from point A to point B. They don't want to deal
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.280]   with it. There's also a smoking gun. Apparently, Apple filed for a patent in 2008 that made it
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:59.280]   impossible for a driver to use a phone while driving. By the way, part of that software looks
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:08.560]   at where in the car you are. Some people are saying, "Well, if you did this, well, they would just
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:16.400]   people would just buy an Android phone." On the other hand, David Teter, who's a former
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.960]   National Safety Council member and a private consultant in road safety, said, "If Apple deployed
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.840]   this technology 10 years ago, there'd be more people alive today. Think about it from a parent's
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:31.280]   perspective." The issue comes down to, "Has Apple made a product or actually shouldn't just be Apple,
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:37.840]   but have manufacturers made a product so addictive, we can't put it down." If that's the case,
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.120]   then don't they need to offer some sort of support to force people to put it down?
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:48.880]   I think Alex is actually on to something. My son is just about 18, so I went through the whole
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.360]   teaching him to drive and everything not that long ago. He was offended by the whole concept.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:59.200]   But I don't want to do this. This is a terrible interface. I could kill someone. Why do I want
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:04.080]   to do this? I had to basically browbeat him into learning to drive because, "Skilly, you need to
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:08.640]   have in the world." The scary. My son had the same issue here. He wouldn't drive when he could first do
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:15.200]   it. He waited years. Tristan's like, "I want to self-drive in car." Yeah, but I understand.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:21.600]   But that's not practical because that's years and years away. That's 40 or 50,000 more people dying.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:28.960]   They estimate 8,000 people died last year due to destructive driving. So what do we do now?
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.640]   Well, I do think that... I mean, I don't know what Apple's patent specifies, but I have to believe
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:41.360]   that we have enough sensors in the phone, whether it's audio or video, to know whether someone is
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:48.720]   the driver. I don't know. I mean, I think that things like CarPlay can tell you very quickly,
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.560]   because as soon as you could have that, the phone that attaches to the car is the one that isn't
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:58.960]   going to let you do anything else on it. I think that that is a pretty simple thing. I think that
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:04.640]   once you start trying to... There's a company called Cell Control that makes a $129 device that uses
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:10.240]   sonic waves to figure out if the phone is in the driver's seat, is being used by the driver or a
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:15.840]   passenger. It might turn off the phone, it says, of the passenger sitting right behind the driver.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:23.520]   Oh, boo-hoo. Right, move over. But seriously, the kinds of things that they're capable of
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.000]   figuring out now are insane. There's some researchers at the University of Washington, for instance,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:35.520]   who can actually identify where people are in rooms and gestures by how you interrupt
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:41.120]   Wi-Fi signals that are just ambient in the atmosphere. You can do that kind of stuff. Yeah,
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.680]   you can figure out who's sitting in the driver's seat. The question is how accurately law school
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.880]   says they should have done it and even done it at a market risk. Apple has failed in their social
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:33:00.080]   responsibility. It's not just Apple, it's the cell phone companies. It's the other manufacturers.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.080]   I do think there needs to be some. I wouldn't go quite that far, but I do think that we're at a
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.600]   level of risk to not only the people who... I'm talking about the idiots who actually use these
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.000]   phones, but the people who have to share a road with the people who use these phones. The level of
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.400]   fatality is such that now an extraordinary need has been demonstrated that perhaps was not there,
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.720]   but the proof was not there five, six, seven, eight years ago. That now is the time where Apple or
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.680]   and Google really can come forward and say the default action is that if it thinks that you're
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.760]   driving a car, it will lock out certain features. You can re-enable certain features, but only after
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.840]   you pull to the side of the road and you stop moving. We will make it hard enough that you can't
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:51.520]   do it at a stoplight. They really have to start inconveniencing people in order to do these
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:57.840]   sort of things. I do have to mention one thing. The thing at the back of my mind that laws like
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:08.320]   this is that they can be abused because if you have a cop that is maybe not the best candidate
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:15.200]   for his or her job, that just wants to pull people over and they need the excuse. Why did you pull
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.440]   this person over in the first place? You can always say, "Oh, well, I thought it looked like he or she
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.040]   was using the phone, so I pulled him over for that infraction to write them up for a ticket for that.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.120]   Oh, it turned out that it was just a candy bar they were eating, and that was pretty okay with me."
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.960]   But again, this is an argument that I might have made seriously more seriously, six or seven or
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.040]   eight years ago before there was so much data, now that there is so much data, that's sort of a
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.200]   back burner sort of thing. So we have an example of where this has already come up,
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.320]   which is basically the whole thing with locking the phones so that they can't be stolen.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.880]   You can't be activation lock on the iPhone. The kill switch. The kill switch basically.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   That was something that had to get pushed for hard by a lot of people. Even government got into
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.640]   it. I think the senators were brow beating. The still carriers could have done this ages ago.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.800]   They didn't do it. So it finally came down to Apple and Google to say, "Okay, we're going to make it so
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:12.080]   cell phones cannot be stolen, basically. They're worthless as soon as they're stolen. I don't
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.640]   have the stats, but my understanding is that it worked hugely. The crimes went down because cell
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.960]   phones were no longer attractive as theft objects. So this is the same kind of thing."
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.400]   Although as so many of the Chairman points out, we also have big drunk driving problems,
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.560]   and we've yet to see breathalyzers attached to ignition switches.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.560]   That's because that's a totally different thing. That's definitely a guilty, before proven instance
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.080]   sort of thing, saying, "We assume that you're going to be committing a crime by climbing into
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.880]   the seat of this car. A phone is not part of your right to drive. A phone is simply a convenience
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.800]   that you're allowed to have, and the manufacturer can decide." I guess part of it is that you can...
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:57.760]   I don't feel as though we need laws to do this. We need Google and Apple because of their position
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.360]   of being able to understand how best to implement this, the capabilities of their hardware,
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:07.920]   and the way to make it so that people actually use this feature, they're more capable of creating
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.360]   this in a way that's actually going to be effective, as opposed to trying to simply
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:18.160]   comply with some law that is designed to sound really good and will definitely be voted in because
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.360]   the name of the law will be named after some adorable little kid who got killed by a distracted driver,
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.960]   and that's not what we want. I think that there has to be some interaction with the car
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:33.840]   manufacturers themselves. I think that the knowing exactly where a person is, it may seem like,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.400]   "Oh, we can do anything," but usually that's anything within a certain percentage of failure.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.640]   It might be one, two, three percent of failure for something like that. When you have hundreds
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.040]   of millions of phones out there, that's going to be a big number of people that are upset because
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:55.280]   they're in an Uber and they can't use their phone. I think that that is the thing that a lot of
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.480]   these manufacturers have taken into account, and that's why it's probably a little bit more
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:04.080]   difficult than just turning a feature on or creating some software, is that there will be some very
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.600]   small percentage of failure, but it's a huge number of people that will be upset. I will admit that
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.480]   I'd be one of those people if I was sitting in the backseat and I couldn't use my phone. As soon as
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:18.800]   I was able to use my phone, I'd be angrily tweeting that, "How do I turn this off?" Who would the idiot
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:24.960]   who did this? I would be the first one to be eviscerating someone for turning my phone off when
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:31.120]   I'm not driving. It's not a feature that I want. I think that by the time we figure this out,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:37.200]   what we'll be rolling out in mass between 2020 and 2030 is going to be—we're not going to
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:44.400]   have a lot of cars that we have to drive by 2030. The point here also, I mean, everybody's saying,
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.840]   "Well, we've had this problem for a long time. We've had this track of driving for a long time."
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:55.680]   But 10% increase in auto fatalities in the first half of last year, equivalent rise
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:02.480]   the year before, something has happened in the last couple of years that has dramatically increased
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.120]   the number of auto deaths. People have been putting on their makeup and reading books and
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.040]   changing the radio station and inserting cassettes for years, but all of a sudden,
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.800]   we get this sudden rise. I think you could safely say, "Well, and it's been that way,
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:20.800]   also, for cell phones. I mean, my father is an attorney, and if one of his clients got into an
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.400]   accident, the first thing that he would do would be subpoena the phone records."
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:29.440]   There's a number one thing you do in a car accident is you subpoena the phone records and see
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.320]   if I'm on the phone. The last time I was re-ended, the guy said, "Hey, I'm sorry I was on the phone."
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.200]   I mean, he just out and said it. I thought you were going to stop at that light. I thought you were
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.920]   going to go through that light, and I was on the phone, so I didn't bother to stop.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:49.920]   I had to lay on the brakes on my bike once and just commit to, "Okay, at some point, I'm going to
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:54.720]   skid, and then I'm going to slide, and then I'm going to fall over because I was passing by,
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.640]   I was entering an intersection where I had the right of way. An SUV was stopped at the stop sign,
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.440]   but the car was rolling forward as though they stopped, but they seen me,
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.840]   and they're just not going to put the accelerator on until I passed by.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.640]   But I looked and I saw that the driver was looking down at the phone, and I'm like,
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.760]   "How much do I want to bet that this person really, really has seen me?" And is waiting
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.360]   versus no. The reason why she took her foot off the accelerator is because she needed to check
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.440]   this text message, and as soon as she's done reading it, she'll stop on the accelerator and kill me."
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:35.760]   And so... Well, and I think a lot of people think that they're much better at texting and driving
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.160]   than they actually are, because when they're doing all the bad driving, they're looking down.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:46.080]   So when they look back up, they're fine. And the thing is, is that I've had a couple friends who I
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:51.040]   just literally kind of throw a little tantrum. So I'm not saying that I'm like,
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.480]   "You got to put your phone down. I'm not going to stay in the car." Because it's just like,
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.360]   it's not because they're on the phone texting, it's because they're on the phone texting,
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.400]   and they are swerving. And I'm like, "This is not working. Not working. Whatever you think
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.440]   is working, it's not." And I've definitely gotten into the habit of, "If I feel like
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.080]   I need to respond to something or even look at my phone, I just pull over. I can pull over for a
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.120]   second and take a look at it. If there's something that pressing, I think it's..." And I think that...
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.640]   I don't know if people have worked with the car... I'm looking at getting a new car and making sure
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:28.000]   that it has car play in it. So are you able to interact with all the different messaging apps
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.680]   with car play? Because I don't use messages much anymore. My wife messages me, but outside of that,
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.080]   I'm using Slack and Messenger and even Hangouts and other things like that. I'm not...
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:44.320]   There's five or six of them, WhatsApp and everything else. And I feel like I can't use those. I think
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.920]   that's another generation of things that has to get updated that you can decide what you're going
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.720]   to listen, what you're going to have read to you and how you're going to respond because
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:41:00.720]   messages are... Well, that's the point. There are apps that we'll do. All of the things we're talking
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:06.240]   about on all the platforms, but people don't choose to use them. Well, Will Messenger work
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.480]   through Apple CarPlay is the question. Oh, no, I know. But I'm just saying that...
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   But this seems like a really great opportunity for AI like the whole system.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.400]   Imagine not only does Google does your phone understand that you're driving,
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.320]   it will say, "I'm sorry, Andy is busy right now. He's driving. May I help you?"
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:30.880]   And the person who's texting, "Oh, I wanted to know if he's going to be... If he's on time for...
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.440]   So meaning at five, is he going to be on time?" And he's like, "Oh, yes. He's on I-95 right now.
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:41.040]   He's just passing through Waltham. His ETA is 4.20 pm. He should be on time for your 4.30...
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.240]   Of course I would never want my phone to tell me that because it would probably tell them that I'm...
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.520]   When I'm telling them that I'm on time and I'm actually on like...
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:50.560]   You don't want to even explain. Or how about...
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.360]   Can I take a message for you?
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.640]   And I also think it's... You can tell them there was an accident.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:01.840]   I think it's a reasonable prediction also to say this won't be solved until we get autonomous
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.640]   vehicles and we're just going to have to put up with another five to ten years of
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:12.080]   senseless fatalities on the road. Defense of driving. Do the best you can. And it does really
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:18.800]   argue for... I really think we're getting to be worse drivers. Just period. It's not just the phones.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.920]   We're just worse drivers. I really do think it's a generational thing. I do think that...
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:33.520]   I'm capable of... Because I'm way older than an 18-19-20 year old. I remember a world in which I didn't
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:41.040]   necessarily... In which not responding to a message is an option and where I can actually
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.320]   and actually think that, "Gee, isn't it nice that I'm in the car for 90 minutes?"
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.200]   And so I'm basically disconnected for most of reality.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:54.560]   I'm certainly not saying that most of these attractive driving incidents are not the responsibility
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.120]   of older drivers. I'm just saying that I think that if there's a noticeable spike,
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.840]   it has to do with not only the spike in usage of these messaging apps, but also,
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:09.280]   again, people entering the... Getting their drivers license who grew up with the idea that
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.920]   this is an immersive sort of thing. You do not ever leave the bubble of social connectivity
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.840]   and why would you ever want to? And we should point out that this isn't Darwin in action because
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:24.560]   as most of these lawsuits are not by people who were driving distracted by innocents who were
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.560]   killed by people who were driving distracted. It's not just the driver, the distracted driver who's
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:35.280]   suffering here. And so that's why it's a larger societal issue. I don't know what the...
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.120]   I does seem like the best answer would be for all the cell companies and all the manufacturers,
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.520]   just to turn on software. You know what, so what if you're a passenger and you can't text?
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.720]   Get over it. Well, I would not. I get a bet. I got a bet. I got a bet. I got a bet. I got a bet.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:55.280]   That's all I'm saying. So they do have sensors. I mean, the cars do have sensors in the seats
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   for airbags at this point. Right. They know... Sitting where? Yeah. Right. If you could tie into
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:07.040]   that in some way, you know, with a little transmitter in the car. The airbag doesn't go off if someone
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:14.240]   is going into insulin shock. I'm saying that it's a very dangerous thing to suddenly say that
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.160]   for an arbitrary reason... What did we do before we had phones in cars, which wasn't that long ago?
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:24.880]   Well, again, again, if we had a medic, we'd die, which is why we're happy that we have
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:35.120]   phones now that we can help people die from bad driving and distracted driving that lives are saved
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.360]   by having phones in cars. And that would give me very little comfort as I see the light in my
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.960]   wife's eyes to fade out and go away forever. They're pulled over. There must be a phone booth around
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:51.200]   there somewhere. Honey, honey. But just your death is making up for eight lives being saved by the
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.600]   fact that I can't call for medical assistance. This is why public policy is so difficult.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:02.400]   By the way, the end of the end, we just moved to trains. I mean, you know, really... We blew it. We
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:08.320]   had all these great things and we just got, especially in California, enamored of the idea that one
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:14.240]   person, one car, is the way to go and it's just been a mess. Stupid speech boys and their songs
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:20.880]   about how cool it is to have a car. Little do's coop. I got a... All right.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.280]   Where's the train songs? That's our logo three. Woody. Woody.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.880]   I took the long way picked up my friends and me and therefore that's where we can drive in the
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:37.440]   HOV. We a commute commute commute commute. I see the train coming coming down the tracks.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:46.320]   Let's see the Apple Campus Christmas New Year's Edition. Once again, the great drone foot. Wow,
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:52.880]   that's looking almost done. That really looks like a UFO now. He's ready for the flame decals.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:57.920]   He's a really big tree in the middle. Well, that's what's missing right is the landscaping.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.800]   That'll be the last thing you do. The solar is really almost all in. It looks very nice.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:11.520]   They're still working on that. They're solar on the whole roof. Wow. That's a lot of capacity.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.280]   Everyone can run in here to earn their desk. Not even care.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:22.960]   I know Google now has said we are 100% renewable in all our operations and I'm sure
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.760]   Apple's aiming for that. When's the first event that I'm not going to be invited to in the
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.800]   new auditorium? When is that? That's what I want to know. I'm begging. I'm telling you, I am going to
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:40.320]   reject my pride, get down on my hands and knees and beg Apple to let me come to the first event in
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:47.200]   that thing. There's Tantau Avenue as opposed to Tonton Avenue. They really missed a bet.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.120]   We could have called it Tonton Avenue. That would have been cool.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:58.720]   Especially if they have like, if there's like a shuttle bus and they have warming stations,
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.680]   it never gets that cold in Cupertino. All people would use them still.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.880]   I was everybody asked like, what did it smell like?
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:19.600]   Much like a real bus kiosk. You thought it smelled bad on the outside and then you got in.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.480]   Some people I guess are hearing only one channel and so the music's driving them crazy.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:31.040]   Someone's going to mute the music. It sounds okay to me in my mix, but I guess some streams are left
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:38.080]   channel only or something like that. Many different types of trees being planted, so you are getting
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.800]   some landscaping. You are not getting Frisbee back if it lands in Mr. Apple's yard. No,
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:52.640]   walkways to and from various areas. Look at that. That's nice. Curvy paths. Tarpes
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:59.040]   laid near maintenance facility due to rain. Man, they got carpets too. This is really over
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.280]   annotated. I want to work at Apple. The mountain of dirt, by the way, we've been watching that
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.640]   mountain of dirt shrink. It's down to nothing. They needed that dirt for something.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.680]   If had employees walking through the exercise yard with little bags in their pants,
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.760]   the hide their hide their again from the chamber commerce.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:26.400]   The main tunnel and security kiosk. Anyway, you can view this on your own. This is nice.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:33.360]   Pokemon. I'm sorry. I confused the two. Super Mario run. How many of you are just to show a
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.640]   hands? How many of you have paid the $10 to unlock all the levels? It's a free program that has
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:47.600]   three free levels and then it's $10. According to some estimates, a mere 3% Apple says no.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:57.120]   It's bigger than that. But how much bigger? The Wall Street Journal said it was about 3%.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.240]   Apple insider asked Apple and Apple says more than 3%.
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:10.080]   But I'm guessing it's not 10%. But I don't know. Is that reasonable expectation? First of
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:17.520]   all, it's 10 bucks. That's expensive. Super Mario run is fun, disappointing to some Mario hardliners.
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:28.640]   Flash out my mar. No, that's what the well known as the Soviet Mario.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.680]   Sorry, Mario. Apple may. Is this Apple acknowledging that there are some markets where
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:38.240]   headphone jacks will be missed for Chinese New Year. They're giving away wireless
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:45.200]   Beats Solo 3 headphones if you buy a Mac or iPhone, select Mac or iPhone products. It's a one day
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:54.080]   only sale and you have to be in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore. But maybe I wonder if this
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.800]   has something to do with the fact that there may be some resistance in certain markets to not
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:07.520]   having a headphone jack. Okay, we'll give you some headphones. Yeah, remember that for a lot of
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:13.520]   people, the price difference of having to buy a different set of headphones is really considerable.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.800]   But you're still getting headphones with the thing. You got the thing with the thing.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.800]   Hard to know. You also get the deal that you need to use the old headphones.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:29.760]   Right. CES is starting today. People are going to Vegas. We've sent Father Robert and a team
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:38.240]   down there. We expect to see a few Apple focused products, including from Dell and LG type C displays
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:46.080]   suitable for use with your MacBook Pro. Everyone wants a really thin display because that's the
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:53.120]   most important thing about displays. It is thin. This is the new Dell Ultra Thin 27 inch IPS display,
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.560]   the world's thinnest monitor. It is HDR 10 that there are three competing HDR standards.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:04.800]   Fortunately, most devices will work with a variety of them, but this one is HDR 10.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.400]   You will want the HDR, I think, especially on a four or five K display.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:15.280]   LG is going to have some new displays. When Renee comes back next week, I'll ask him because
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:22.480]   he bought the LG 5K display. I think he got it by now, but there are. He was tweeted from the
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:28.800]   Instagram from the Apple store with his boxes. Yeah, I saw the box as fast as fast as fast.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:33.520]   This is a product I might get from other world computing won't be available till this spring.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:38.640]   They're showing it at CES. It's a stack that goes underneath your MacBook Pro, makes it a
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:47.840]   thick device, but adds four terabytes of storage and SD card slot, traditional USB type A ports,
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.560]   and a gigabit ethernet port. See, Alex is going to want one. Does it have a mag safe?
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:57.920]   No, no. It'd be fun if it had a CD ROM. It looks big enough to hold.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.560]   I was going to say, how does it connect in?
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:05.120]   That's a good question. It looks like the Mac just sits on that, and I don't see any wires.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.000]   No, no, they're like they're leaving out the wire. There's got to be a type C to type C connection,
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:17.280]   right? I would so. Yeah. Well, unless they're doing something crazy, like capping your
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:22.160]   of the base plate and screwing that into that would go. But I can't imagine them getting
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:29.360]   clearance for doing that now. All right. And you mentioned the hack.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:39.280]   This is a give from Gizmodo that will make your AirPods look like dental floss. You just
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.000]   you just basically take a glide sticker off your dental floss and apply it.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:51.120]   It does look remarkably like a dental floss case. And here's a guy who's apparently got
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.840]   there's commitment. That's commitment. He's got gauges in his ears, decided to pop the
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:00.880]   little gauges out and put the AirPods through the holes in his ear. Of course, I don't know how
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.040]   well the mic would work in that angle. You know, it's on. Mostly, we'll be picking you up going
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:15.120]   out. Ow. Yeah, make sure you have a hole first. And that that hole takes a little while to develop.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.360]   Yeah, you got to grow it. You got to slowly increase the gauges bit by bit.
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:29.440]   Foxconn says we are going to replace almost every human worker with robots.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:38.320]   So take that Donald Trump. They actually are considering apparently moving but doing some
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.200]   manufacturer Foxconn doing some manufacturer in the US. If a person has been automated,
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:48.720]   they're going to move the automated versions back to the US with all the cash that Apple will bring
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:55.280]   back to the US when they only have to pay 10% on it. Wow. That's what's going on. You know,
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.160]   they call Foxconn calls the robots Foxbots.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.960]   I will not do it with a Fox. I will not do it.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:10.880]   Not a Foxy bot. A Fox and like the wireless and like the wireless headphones, they are making
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.240]   them as fast as they can. As fast as they can. I think that's probably exactly. I think somewhere
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.800]   the article it says that they've been making those. They're making our Foxbots out as fast as we
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:28.800]   can. Let's take a break. And ladies and gentlemen, our picks of the week coming up next. First,
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:38.960]   a pick for all of you. The ring video doorbell. This was the holiday sensation. Ring is having a
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.280]   hard time. They're literally making them as fast as they can. And I'm no wonder I love our ring
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.360]   video doorbell. I know people have multiple ring video doorbells. Calla Canis has two.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:53.040]   They are fantastic. What is it? It's a doorbell. I got one right here.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.840]   It replaces your existing doorbell or you can use the original ring
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:04.880]   anywhere because it has a big battery in it. And it has a camera, an HD camera, microphone
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:10.720]   and speaker plus motion sensors. So this doorbell suddenly is the ultimate security device when
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.600]   it was so great when we were on vacation, I could see who was coming and going from the house.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:21.120]   If my son was having a party, what was going on? Who can't? And I have a record of it too.
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.880]   Because I pay the I think it's $30 a year to store all that online. So I can always see. I can say,
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:32.560]   hey, hey, you see this? 1 30 a.m. in the who was that coming in?
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.440]   I got my ring video doorbell. You also see all the packages that are delivered. You can keep an
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.560]   eye on the packages. You see anybody coming up your steps. And now we've got these great ring
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.960]   of security kits, which include not just the ring video doorbell, but also take your pick.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:54.320]   You could get the the the stick up cam, which is a doorbell without the doorbell. It's got every
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.920]   the everything else that the camera, the motion sensors, the microphone, the speaker. And you could
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:04.560]   put those elsewhere around your property so that you can watch every bit of it wirelessly because
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:12.800]   it also has the solar panel that keeps it charged all day and all night. Nice. The HD stick up
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.320]   cam is weatherproof. You could put it anywhere. They also sell a chime that you could plug into
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.840]   any standard power outlet. So if your phone is in the other room and you can't hear the doorbell
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.640]   from where you are, maybe you're out there in the garage or the kitchen and the chime will ring.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.560]   And there's an illuminated security sign that deters in two years before they get to your door.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.120]   That doesn't have to plug in either. It's got a solar panel that keeps it lit up. So pick the kit
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:45.280]   you want get up to $150 off for this limited time when you go to ring.com/macbreak
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:53.440]   ring.com/macbreak. I almost took this with me. I was going to install it for my mom. I didn't
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:57.600]   get around to it, but I'm going to go out in the spring and do this for my mom because I did set
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:04.320]   her up with Eros. I set her up. I did a tech visit to my mom and this was going to be one of
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:10.080]   the things I just didn't get around to doing it. Ring.com/macbreak. Mom, it's her birthday.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.080]   Yesterday was her birthday. Maybe I'll just center the ring as security kit and say I'll
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.600]   install it when I get there. For some reason, when you said it at the beginning of the ad,
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:27.840]   when you said the ring video, I was imagining the ring movie. No, no. I'm a doorbell where it was
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:33.360]   a little video of a little kid with her hair running towards you. You have one week to
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.160]   convince somebody else to rub your same door and ring the same bell. No, it's not that.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.640]   There was one point where my daughter was at that age. For some reason, she'd come in at night
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.440]   from her room and her hair would be in front of her. When you wake up that way and there's a girl
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.960]   after you've seen the movie, it wakes up quickly. Yeah. Very fast. Exactly.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:59.360]   Crawling up the bell. Leo, if the Amazon app could be integrated with the security things,
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:02.880]   we could actually tell you what's in the packages that you've just arrived on your doorstep.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:08.800]   Oh, isn't that would be nice. See, you've got to be able to hack. You've got to be able to connect
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:13.840]   the things together, iOS. I think we're getting there. I really do. I think it's just a matter of time.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:20.720]   A number of things that we're going to see at CES this week are the Amazon Echo Tech capability
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:26.160]   built in Lenovo just announced their version and it uses the Amazon software. So it works the same
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:31.520]   exact way. I think we're going to see a lot of devices with voice control built in. One of the
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:35.520]   reasons Lenovo is doing it is they said we're going to use it as the hub for our home automation
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:41.440]   system. I think that that's really that's another thing that's going to be a big story in 2017.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:46.080]   All right. Time for our, by the way, thank you Ring for your support and for a great product,
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:53.680]   which we use all the time Ring.com/MacBreak. Time for our picks of the week.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.560]   Who should I start with? How about you, our guest, Adam Inkst?
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:06.160]   Certainly. So my pick of the week is sort of in beta, I guess, actually, but it is available
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:12.320]   and you can check it out. It's called set app and it's kind of an alternative
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:19.760]   to the app store in some ways. You can think of it as Netflix for Mac apps where you pay, I think,
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:26.400]   it's $9.99 a month and then you get access to, I don't actually know what the current number is.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:31.840]   It's like, I don't know, 40 or 50 apps and more coming all the time. And these are real apps.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:36.640]   These are apps from developers I know. Marked, rapid weaver, clean my Mac.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.240]   This is a little like the humble bundle.
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:44.320]   Well, but it's a subscription. So you're paying your $9.99 a month and you get access to all these
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:51.440]   apps. And what they do is kind of clever. So once you download the stuff, the apps,
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:56.480]   sort of, they all install themselves in a folder, but it's not the full app. It's just this little
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:03.600]   stub. So it's a much space. And when you double click it, it opens up this kind of a preview
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:08.960]   window, sort of like the app store and the Mac app store or the app store for iOS. It's even a
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:12.880]   little better, frankly, I think, and tells you all about the app, gives you some screenshots and
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:17.840]   all that, then you click a, I forget what the button is, open or install or run or whatever it is.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.560]   And then it proceeds to download all the code.
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:23.200]   It's a really important system for Mac apps.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:27.840]   So it's really easy to grab this stuff. And I said, the apps are pretty serious.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.200]   But you pay one flat rate. You don't pay for each app or how does that work?
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.880]   It was one flat rate monthly.
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.920]   How much is that?
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.120]   It's $9.99 a month.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:35.520]   Okay.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.960]   So you have to decide whether it's going to be worthwhile if you have used enough apps.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.240]   I mean, but you know, some of these apps, Ulysses, iFlicks, hype, I mean, these are,
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.080]   these are things that do cost some money. And you know, if you were going to be paying for
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:53.680]   them and their updates and whatnot every year, $120 for this collection of, I wish I knew how
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:01:02.800]   many it was exactly. I'm going to check my folder. I'll open in Finder. I've got 57 items right now.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.760]   Wow.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.760]   So that's a lot of apps. And I said, every couple of days I've been getting a notification.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:10.400]   We just added a new app. We just added a new app. You can check it out.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:16.560]   So, you know, I, this is from the Mac Paw people, one of the Ukrainian company behind Gemini and
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:21.840]   Clean My Mac and good folks. And they're, I think they're taking it slow. And they're not trying to,
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.640]   you know, hammer this out and, you know, be as big and, you know, fancy from the very beginning
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:32.320]   as they can. But it could be really useful for people who find themselves using a lot of apps
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:35.280]   and want to be able to try apps, you know, a little bit like Netflix, you know, you want to
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.520]   listen, watch the first five minutes of the movie and go, yeah, I guess not, you know, no harm, no fall.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.400]   Very interesting.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.040]   Well worth a look.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.120]   And I use a number of the apps that are on here like you, these are, you know, good apps.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:47.840]   Yeah.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.200]   And that's the thing is it's not one of those bundles where you're like, yeah, there's the
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.680]   one app I know about. And then the five, the seven things I've never heard of before. So it's got
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:02.080]   some, you know, and some of them are fairly productive like Simon, which is a website monitoring
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:09.600]   app, again, big app, disk drill, you know, disk recovery software, Chronosync Express, you know,
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:14.960]   syncing app. This is stuff that I'm looking at in my side. I stat menus. I installed that
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:21.040]   immediately. I love I stat menus. So people's checking out, you know, I understand all the
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:24.480]   issues with subscriptions. People don't want to have a subscription. Sometimes that's fine. You
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:31.600]   don't have to. This isn't required of you. But if, you know, $10 a month, $120 a year is worth it
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:36.640]   to you for access to these 57 apps and more that may appear in the future, give it a try.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:47.120]   I like seeing new models, new ways of doing stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is set app.com. S-E-T-A-P-P.com.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:53.360]   Alex, Lizzie, your pick of the week. So I spend a lot of time on the road. And I have a phone
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:59.840]   that dies at 40% when it's warm and 60% when it's cold. That's really interesting that the
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.280]   temperature of the phone affects that. I didn't think it would, but it is repeatable. So if it's
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:12.240]   below 45 degrees, it will end very quickly. So I've become very sensitive to always having a battery
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.800]   around. You know, like I don't, I have most of my phones have these
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.880]   scene cases that I keep. And you know, this is the, you know, this scene of case here that
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:31.920]   keeps on my wallet stuff. And so I don't want to have a case. But I also, then I have to find
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.280]   cables and so on and so forth. I've really gotten into these. I've gotten a couple of these, these
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:39.520]   little mophies. They keep on getting smaller. And I think I might have recommended one before,
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.640]   but this is even, even tinier. This is a, this is a, this is the 4000 milliamp
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:49.840]   mophie. But the big thing is it has a lightning connector that's just kind of integrated.
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.320]   And so, which I just didn't do very well, but you can basically just kind of peel it off.
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:00.320]   Now, there's a couple that have this built in that are cheaper. The real problem is that they're,
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:04.560]   they're extra wires or they're bigger or, you know, and what I really need is just something to
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:09.200]   top me off if I'm, you know, so I throw this in my back pocket. A lot of times we're in one of my
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.000]   Scotty best pockets, you know, when I'm going to walk around just to make sure that I, you know,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:20.560]   I have some power. If I, if I need it, even with the, with my, my iPhone 7, I, I find myself
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:26.400]   needing every once in a while. So much less, much less than my success, not that I'm bitter, but,
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.720]   but the, but anyway, it's a great, it's a great little battery. And I just like that it's very
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:36.160]   small, easy to pull out and it keeps the cable with it. So I don't have to figure that out
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:43.920]   when I'm in the airport. That's it. Nice. By the way, I bought the, I bought the, the, the luggage
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:50.240]   that we that we had to wait, the way luggage is neck, right? It was good. First, first time I'm
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:54.880]   in the airport, I'm charging it. I'm charging my phone sitting on top of the luggage. I got
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:05:00.000]   a bloat. I brought my way carry on, but I checked it and I realized, oh, shoot, there's, I don't have,
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.120]   I can't charge my phone because I checked my luggage. So next time carry it on.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:11.680]   Now we were, it was like, I've trained my kids now to all care, you know, nine by 14 by 22 cases.
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:12.880]   Then you don't have to check packages.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:15.840]   They pack their little cases and they've got little rush, rush 12,
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:20.480]   backpacks that have, you know, a little, you know, we're getting their names on them and stuff
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.640]   like that. And so they're just a bunch of, I mean, we're kind of training them all for that process.
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:32.160]   I do notice that more airports have power now. The Boston's Logan has plugs everywhere. So,
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.920]   which was nice. And then some specifically don't.
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:40.240]   And that's something that it's like, oh, it's too expensive. You would probably use it.
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:43.920]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Andy and I co pick of the week.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:50.800]   You know how I apologize? So I'll be sometimes now in next show, I'll be
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:55.600]   examining the entire house for things that on the network that might be causing a certain video
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:02.720]   feed. But you know that oftentimes I'll go after Alex and Alex will have like,
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:08.480]   talked about a $12,000 thing. And then I'll talk about like a free app or a special
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:12.480]   putty that costs $4. This is not one of those times. So let's say that,
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.520]   let's say that reveal for later. My pick of the week is a really wonderful thing that I've
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:22.480]   been testing out for the past couple of weeks. Now I'll be testing it until I have a loner of this
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:29.840]   until early spring. This is an e-bike made by specialized. Oh, I want an e-bike so bad.
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:36.800]   Then this is now people think of electric bikes with electric motors as like they're like mopeds.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:41.120]   That's not the case. This is a there are a bunch of different bikes that are like this,
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:49.120]   where the entire idea is that it's an electric assist bike, where it's still it's exactly like
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:58.880]   a regular bike, except imagine that you're way, way, way more fit. So that instead of normally on my
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:04.960]   Trek bike, I'm doing about 10, 11 miles per hour average on like a five or 10 mile trip.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:10.000]   On this bike with the assist of the electric motor providing about 40% of the work,
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:15.680]   I'm averaging about 15 to 20%. The result is that,
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:22.080]   although again, it feels like there's no sudden stops, there's no lurches. It's just simply
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:27.040]   things are a little bit easier. You can still tire yourself out. Your legs will still kill.
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:32.400]   Your will still be out of breath. But the difference is that when you get the top of that gentle hill
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.800]   goes on for a mile and a half, instead of when you reach that plateau finally, instead of feeling
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:44.240]   like you need to go into the grass and die, you will just be very, very tired. And it also means that
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:51.440]   for me, like the comfortable radius of riding my regular bike is I will ride the bike anywhere
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:58.080]   that's with five or six miles or less with this e-sus bike. That's been increased 10 or 15,
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:05.840]   because a I'm not totally beat to hell after doing 15 or 20 miles. And also I can get their
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:11.920]   twice as fast as I would on a regular pedal bike. And if you are, and it will also,
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:22.080]   I found this out this morning, I wrote to look to a breakfast date and pouring rain and it was
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.160]   40 degrees or maybe a little less than 40 degrees. And the reason why I said, okay, I'm definitely,
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:33.920]   I'll still take the bike as planned is knowing that I can, it'll be a lot, I won't be out in the
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:39.760]   rain as long as I would have on my regular bike. And also in addition to like the assist mode,
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:46.480]   it also has what I call ridiculous mode, which is instead of being a regular bike, and it will
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.240]   give you some help, it essentially turns into an exercise bike and the rate at which you turn
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:58.160]   pedals acts as a throttle control for the bike. So that if I want, if I want to turn the pedals
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:04.320]   really, really fast, I can do 20 to 25 miles an hour. And I'm only getting tired because of how
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:09.120]   fast I'm turning the cranks. But if I want to get up that really, really steep hill at the
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:14.320]   bottom of my street, and I'm in ridiculous mode, I can turn the pedals very, very slowly and will
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:20.480]   just smoothly get me up the street. So if I'm late, so if I want to get out of the rain really,
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:26.320]   really, really quickly, or if I'm on like a 20 mile ride, and I'm really not feeling it for
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:32.960]   the last three miles, or if I'm 50 miles into a ride, and I'm at the base of a really, really high
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:39.760]   hill, and I'm not feeling the need to like shift in pedal really, really hard, I can still work
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.000]   because there's still some force fed back to the pedals, but in the ridiculous mode,
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.640]   it can take it to 25 miles an hour easily, but it can also just get you up the hill without
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.520]   feeling as though you're going to die. The battery will last. It takes a lot of testing.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:02.960]   I've figured that I'm figuring in about 50 or 60 mile range, that's with a combination of using
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:10.160]   it as a conventional bike, assisted by it, and using it in the ridiculous mode or the lame mode,
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:18.960]   as a friend of mine would put it. And the battery takes 10 or 12 hours to recharge using the charger
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.960]   that comes with the bike. You can also get a charger that will reach a big shoebox size charger that
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:31.120]   will recharge it in your four hours. So you can you can either charge overnight your garage or
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.600]   conceivably if you keep another charger in your office, you could recharge it at the office, but
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.240]   has enough of a range that you don't necessarily have to make sure you get in every night. This is
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:46.960]   not an Apple watch. And it's just a really, really fun, comfortable ride. There are other e-bikes that
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:53.200]   like they want to really be flashy. And so the body is shaped like a like a lightning bolt or
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:57.680]   something. This looks like a very, very normal bike. You can even like with a key, you can even
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:02.960]   remove the bat the bat the thick that the down tube is where the battery is. The picture that has
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:09.520]   that power switch that they sent you that is the removable battery. It goes the entire length of
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:14.240]   the down tube. And so you can actually pop that off, take it inside and charge it inside.
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:19.200]   You'll not only bikes do that. I like that. Right. Now, but there are some downsides to it.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:24.800]   One of which being that a does this is not a specialized makes a lot of bikes, but it's not
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.200]   as though they took one of their trail bikes and simply slapped a motor. This was designed to be
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:36.960]   an electric bike. As such, they didn't worry about weight. So this is a this is a 50 pound bike.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.200]   So although there is a mode, there are two other modes you can operate it with. There's a
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:48.480]   little indicator and a little thumb joystick on the handlebars when the shifters.
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.680]   So you can select these promotes one of them is a regen, which if you're going, it doesn't
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:57.840]   regenerate electricity automatically when you break or anything. But if you're going down a
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:02.720]   long hill, if you want, you can maybe get another couple percentage of the battery back by flipping
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.440]   it into this regen mode. But it also has the turn everything off just be a regular bicycle mode.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:13.280]   And that is death. It's because you're you're you're having a 50 pound plus whatever weight you have.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:19.280]   You're carrying with you up that hill or down that straight. But it does have that mode. If you
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:25.120]   if you want it, the other disadvantage. I will also say that it's a very all the components on this
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.520]   bike as a bike are really, really good. I've never had a bike with disc brakes before.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.440]   They are excellent. I kind of now I'm thinking of getting disc brakes for my bike,
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:37.440]   because they're such a much better, smoother braking experience.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.080]   Specialize ships really good bikes. They know what they're doing.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:46.080]   They're really all components are really good. The Shimano shifters are not the very top of the
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:50.320]   line, but they're comfortably in the middle of the range of what they do. I think they're electronic
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:57.200]   shaft shifters. The brakes are hydraulically operated. So it's really, really comfortable ride,
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:03.200]   really, really nice. Top and bottom inside and out. And the other thing I'll before I finish,
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:09.120]   it's also technically it qualifies as a pick because it is technically a own accessory,
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:15.120]   because there's a phone app that the little bike computer that's built in great job.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.520]   But you can also access special features through the phone app. For instance,
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:24.960]   let's say that you're a little bit parched for electricity. You didn't get to charge last night,
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.840]   and you you're pretty sure you have enough juice in the battery to make it to work and back again.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.040]   You can actually set it up through the app to say, whatever I tell you to do, I want you to
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.720]   in that with the idea that I'm telling you to make sure I still have 20% battery left at the end of
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:45.600]   the day. So it will fine tune the performance of the battery so that maybe you will have to work
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:49.040]   a little bit harder than you would normally do, but it will make sure that you have whatever
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:54.800]   percentage you have left. You can also tell it to, as you get more proficient, you can actually
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:14:00.320]   start off by saying, please assist me 90% of work. But you can dial that down to whatever you
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.960]   want it to be. So if you just want 20% or 10%, I've got I think at 40, I think 45%. I might actually
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:11.840]   take it down a little bit because there are times mode that I feel like I'm kind of I could be
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:17.520]   working harder. But as you again, as your level of fitness increases, you can change that up or down
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:22.720]   as you want to go or if you're finding you're having trouble in certain routes. So it's really,
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:26.880]   really great bike. I'm having a lot of fun with it. I'm riding a lot more even though it's winter
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:32.480]   and even though the weather is crappy. Now here's the bad news. It's $4,000 brand new.
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:40.560]   And this market, some of the other E-assist bikes are between 1500 and 2500.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.840]   I have not had a lot of experience with the rest of them. I've not seen the sort of features and the
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.720]   sort of performance I've seen in this one has a really high capacity battery. And once again,
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:54.320]   there are no searchers, there are no stops, there's no starts, there's no throttle.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:15:00.480]   It's just simply you pedal and suddenly you are 18 years old again. And somehow you can you can
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:05.520]   do 20 miles and not even your butt will wear out before your legs or your heart will wear out
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:10.160]   or your lungs will wear out when you're using this bike. It's but it's really interesting. I really
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.360]   want a bike like this to be on people radar. My real review won't be coming for another few months
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.480]   because I really want to evaluate in terms of let's say that you are a two car family,
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:28.080]   but you suspect that maybe you only need one real car because the other one is you have your
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:33.680]   spouse works 30 or 40 miles away. Your office is five or 10 miles away. And you've been thinking
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.680]   that she would have what could we do better by simply having a bicycle while you can do even
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:43.440]   better if you have an e-bike because you'll get there faster, you'll be less tired out, you'll be
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.840]   less sweaty. And I really think that part of the solution to a lot of the problems we're going to
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:54.160]   have in transportation involve trying to get as many cars off the road as possible. I myself am in
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:00.000]   the very unique position because I'm self-employed, I work out of the house and usually the places I
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:07.040]   need to go to are five or 10 miles away. As I said, I think a couple times before, I have not owned a
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.200]   car or excuse me, I've not owned a running car for about a year and a half now because I keep trying
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:18.560]   to see how much longer you can get away with not having one. And riding this bike for a couple
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:25.280]   weeks makes me wonder if I ever want to have another car. I'll just say that I'm way more excited
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:31.440]   about the possibility of buying something like this e-bike in the future than I am about buying
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.640]   any new car that I could possibly buy in the future. It's really a pretty big thing.
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:46.560]   Also, also the headphone jack. Well, actually, I will say one silly thing. I thought that
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.200]   absolute no brainer is well, of course, you're going to have like a charging port. So if you have
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.960]   like your phone mounted on the handlebars or your lights or something, because they usually are
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.000]   recharge by USB. So you can just plug in off this big honking or honking battery. But no,
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.880]   I want that's part of waterproofing. Unfortunately, over the past couple of weeks, I've had several
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:12.000]   opportunities to ride in the rain and leave this parked outside a diner or library in the rain
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.360]   for a couple hours. It hasn't electrocuted me yet and it hasn't failed to start yet. So maybe
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:26.080]   that'll sacrifice the waterproofing. But it's a hundinger and $4,000 sounds like a lot of money
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:32.160]   for a bicycle. It's not a lot of money for a high performance bicycle. And when you think about,
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:38.160]   well, when you think about buying that second car for the family, for two person family,
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:47.040]   imagine getting $4,000 for a really top of the line electric bike versus spending
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:53.920]   eight to $10,000 or a used car with 50 or 60,000 miles on it, plus the taxes, plus the insurance,
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:59.280]   plus the gas, and think about everything that you could do with surplus money. And I'll tell
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:05.200]   you that again, it was ridiculous. It was raining, it was sleeting, it was cold. I had gloves on,
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:12.560]   I had a coat on, I was warm, but I was just being laced with rain. And I had this big grin on my face
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:17.680]   because this is, I think, Oh my God, I'm one of those idiots that I used to drive past in my car
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:22.080]   thinking, what kind of fool is out on his bike on weather like this? But you find yourself,
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:28.880]   this is so much fun. I am enjoying, I've been doing riding a bike in the rain and being this kind of
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:33.440]   a fool. It's well worth anybody looking into.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:39.200]   But what you do need is the night bar 2000 so that you can have kit the night rider.
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.640]   I show my Mac, show my Mac. There's nothing, there's no point in doing that unless you show the
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.960]   touch bar. This is the only use, thank you to Patrick Delaney for telling me about this. The
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:54.800]   only use for the touch bar in the Mac is to turn it, you can turn up my audio now, just a little bit.
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.720]   It did. Oh, it stopped to turn it into. So this is crazy. It's an open source project.
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.840]   Night touch bar 2000, you'll find it on GitHub and it can turn your
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:10.720]   silly touch worlds easiest game of all.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:15.040]   When Patrick showed me, I thought, is there more? Is it going to do more? No, no, that's all it does.
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:16.960]   It just goes back and forth and plays the night rider.
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:23.440]   The Mandy and I go Chicago, sometimes. Thank you so much for joining us. We will see you next week.
