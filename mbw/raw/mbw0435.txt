[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Alex Lindsey's in studio.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Andy Enacos on a Skype call.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   As he forgot to buy tickets,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   but we are on our last show of 2014.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And yeah, there's even some Apple news.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   We'll also talk a little bit about what to look forward to in 2015,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   including home automation, a giant iPad and more.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'm Mac.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   We've got both Alex Lindsey and Renee Richie in studio.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Thank you for flying down Renee.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Renee came down from Montreal for just a couple of days.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He's came to our host dinner last night, Mac break weekly today.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Tomorrow's New Year's Eve party, our 24 hours of 2015.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And then you go home for two days.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And then you come back to see you.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Crazy.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's a good way to start a year.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Crazy.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Well, anyway, we're very grateful.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Thanks to Alex Lindsey, who came all the way from Pittsburgh PA.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yes.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   What happened to be here?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And unfortunately, Andy Naco's still home, still trying to find a flight.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Well, you know, as I said, I'm glad I brought my equipment because I was able to set up this corner of the terminal at Logan Airport to an approximation to the studio.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So hopefully we get a good signal off my phone here.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   This is going to cost me at least $90 in overage fees.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You know what's really cool is that there's this thing called the Internet.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And you can leave order tickets.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Actually, thanks to Skype.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Really, it's like Andy's here.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And are you going to participate in any way in New Year's Eve tomorrow?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Are you I have no specific plans for New Year's Eve?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I would love to again.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And I've got the studio set up here in case my flight does not leave Logan in the next 36 hours.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'll be more than happy to be standing by.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I have a lovely, I have a lovely bottle of champagne that someone was nice enough to send me as part of a beautiful gift basket that I would nivelling at for the past week.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And we will pop that at the appropriate time and the appropriate.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I feel informed the authorities.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's going to be fun.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We're doing it for UNICEF, a benefit for UNICEF.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And if you go to inside.twit.tv, our blog, you'll see that people have already started donating.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We've raised several thousand dollars before we even mentioned anything.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We're trying to recreate kind of in honor of you, Andy and Merlin Mann, the Jerry Lewis Telethon.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You guys always loved that.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And we had a lot of fun talking about it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You'll never walk alone.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I have to learn.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You realize, Leo, that you should have started taking the Percocet at least three days ago.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So that takes full effect by 1 AM.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I am really looking forward to it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   We did something a little different this year.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We started this last year because I thought, well, it'd be fun to honor our global audience
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and say Happy New Year in every time zone.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   There are 27 of them.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   This year we've got 21 of the 27 time zones represented via somebody on Skype calling us from that time zone.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We'll start counting down with the very first country to enter 2015, which will be 3 this morning, tomorrow morning.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm confused.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   When?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   3 tomorrow morning, 3 AM, Pacific time, 6 AM Eastern time.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That'll be New Zealand.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And we have somebody and we're going to just slowly walk down John's running to give me the time zones.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   We get somebody, oh, we're getting close now.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Who do we not have?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We have three, we have four time zones missing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Five.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well, there's more than that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   More than that?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   All right, but we're pretty good.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You see all the yellow.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's people.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The green is people with really good connections.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You know who's doing this?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   He's your people.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yes, Anna.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Anna is working through the yellow usually means.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah, we will start in Arrowtown, Otago, New Zealand with Andrew Smith.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   The cameras a bit grainy because speeds are kind of slow in Arrowtown.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   But he will be welcoming the New Year at 3 AM, 1100 UTC tomorrow and on through the day.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's going to be fun.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And we'll go to...
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Now, I don't see John.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I thought we'd have one.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   We're missing a time zone here.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   We don't have somebody for the sandwich islands or Samoa or whatever it is.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You're missing Jarvis Island at the bottom there, 3 AM.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Oh, I don't know how big are people.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Oh, these are people.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   These are not the ones.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I just added this to another line.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   One more line.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Because I do want somebody at Jarvis Island.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's a bird sanctuary uninhabited.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But it will be the last place on the globe to welcome 2015.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It's really cool if we had a webcam down there shooting the birds.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I think so.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In the middle of the night.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I think so.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I was sleeping.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We're looking forward to it and a lot of people coming up.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We have a big studio audience today.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Any of you sticking around for tomorrow's festivities?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I hope.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Please do.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You could stay up from now till then.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And then you can...
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Sure.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Sure.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Well, did anything happen over the last few weeks since we've been here?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   We had a great best of.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Thank you, Jason Howell, for cobbling that together.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   No problem.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   My pleasure.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   A lot of fun seeing all the stupid things I said.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.440]   Including me and was it Matthew Ingram talking about how Apple was done?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.760]   That was before WWDC in June.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.440]   That's my only excuse.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.560]   Apple is far from done, obviously.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   Apple's streaming the interview.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   Did anybody watch that?
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   No.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.440]   Oh, they finally decided.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's on iTunes.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So it's on Google.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's on iTunes.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.680]   The theater in town is showing it.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   It's made a lot of money.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, not as much as it might have made.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.840]   Here's the thing that's interesting.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.400]   So it hasn't made as much maybe as it would have been in the theaters.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.160]   But as a internet, mostly like a day and date release.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   $15 million is the best Sony's ever done.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.440]   And I think that the irony of all of this is this may be what everyone looks back at
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.520]   as everyone thought, "Well, maybe we could make some money on the internet."
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   It could be a watershed.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.960]   I don't think all those people would have watched it if not for the surrounding circumstances.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.920]   But you can't translate those into ticket sales.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   No, I don't think so.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.400]   But I think I agree with what Alsang.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.360]   They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into saying, "We're going to do a high profile
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.320]   movie release backed up by both national advertising and it's going to be available
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.760]   on streaming that very day."
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   And this was not a bad result.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.800]   It might even encourage them to say, "Well, here's a movie.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.240]   We don't have a whole lot of confidence in less to a second experiment in February or
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.240]   March."
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.120]   I think back to there was a writer's strike in the early '80s that created the reality
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   TV boom.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   Because...
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   That's right.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   The writers went on strike.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   That's right.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   They had to fill air.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.840]   And so they said, "Well, it's not going to get any ratings, but let's do this thing.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   We'll call it real people.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.800]   It's just going to be interviews with people all across the country.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.960]   We'll have a host that just sort of spontaneously say things.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.560]   And it got great ratings and it cost damn near next to nothing.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.640]   And the network said, "We would never have put this on the air had we not been forced
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.160]   to, but now that we've been forced to and we've looked at the numbers back, let's do
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   more of this."
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   Continue to strike everybody.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.160]   So the really interesting article in The New York Times about how this happened, this
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   came out the day before Christmas Eve.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.600]   Apparently the president actually intervened with Apple.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   Oh, really?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.840]   He tried and they said they're not...
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   So Apple doesn't...
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   They're on holiday.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.800]   iTunes connect closes for two weeks.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   Sorry.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.760]   We're on vacation, Mr. President.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.480]   Well, no, but the process for iTunes is not the fastest in the world.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.200]   And when they're closed and they just basically said, "We're not going to go there and start
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.840]   cranking the computers for you, but with the next available spot, you'll get it."
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.120]   And so it got out as fast as iTunes would normally.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.240]   We're credit to the Alamo draft house, which is an Austin theater chain.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   That is a great sentiment.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   I love it.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   I didn't know there's 20 others, including supposedly one's coming to San Francisco.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.040]   But they were the first to say, "You know what?
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.680]   We'll show it."
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.920]   And then that kind of began the run on it.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.640]   But Sony had planned to have it in 3000 theaters for Christmas Day and instead just a few hundred.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.080]   Plus remember, Apple takes a third.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.560]   I don't know what Google takes, but...
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   That's better.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.840]   So the third is better than the theaters take.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.360]   I thought the theaters gave them the whole tickets.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.480]   I don't think Apple takes a third for movies.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   Oh, no.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.520]   I think for Indies they do, but I think for studios they sometimes even lose money still.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   Make a deal.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   And you said...
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   So I thought the theater deal was the...
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   I think it's weighted.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   So I think it's weighted.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.080]   Like ticket sales go to the movie company and then the theater gets the popcorn.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   So I think that it's...
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   It's just by the way more...
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   Look at that right here.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.760]   I believe, and I'm not positive of this, but I believe that what happens is it's weighted.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   So the first couple of weeks, the percentage is much more leaning towards the movie company.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.120]   And then it goes back to...
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   As it goes.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.360]   And that's why you're able to have these kind of second run theaters that run them that
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.880]   can do it for a lot less and make it profitable.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.760]   So I believe that's how it works, and someone will probably correct me.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.040]   Initially, this...
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.160]   And so before you jump on the bandwagon and blaming the exhibitors, the FBI had told
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   theaters...
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.120]   Remember the hackers said we threatened 911 style violence if you show the interview.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.040]   The FBI had initially told theaters treat it like a bomb threat credible until proven
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   otherwise.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   Right.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.360]   And then Obama says in public, "I wish they'd called me."
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.880]   And I feel like what he would have said to them is, "Look, we know that we can assess
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.720]   this threat and there's no chance that North Korea is...
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.480]   That's holding the capacity to do that."
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.720]   Well, and I think that a lot of times there's things that he would want to say privately
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   that he wouldn't say in public.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.160]   So far, no problems except that it's a crap movie.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   But other than that...
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.240]   You make it nauseous from the movie.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.920]   All this over the wrong movie, most likely.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   But I still think that the issue is that when you look at...
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.080]   It still proves, I don't think we've seen very many movies that have sold, $15 million
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   worth of tickets.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.280]   I don't know of any have sold, that kind of level.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   And what that...
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.880]   It's not so much that that makes it so you're not going to start seeing $100 million films.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.120]   But if you're an independent filmmaker or you're Sony Classic Pictures or some of these
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   other ones looking at, "Well, can I do a $2 million budget and now might be viable to
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.920]   do a $2 million budget and get my money back?"
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   And that was a...
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   Was it a cars movie?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.480]   Yeah, well, there was a huge machine that used to exist around Blockbuster.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.280]   Blockbuster and all the other rentals where you could be guaranteed...
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.960]   What you do is you get into distribution deals and you get some foreign distribution, you
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   get some cable buys, but the big thing was is that you knew that just Blockbuster's stocking
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.480]   Blockbuster would make you enough money to pay for the film.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.640]   You didn't even matter when you bought it, just the rental would be enough.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.480]   Netflix never really replaced that revenue.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.280]   And so a lot of that stuff just kind of went away.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.400]   If people start feeling like they can do a $2 million film and make a profit, that whole...
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.920]   And now it's cheaper to make the film than it ever has been because of the hardware is
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.560]   less expensive, there's a lot of things that are more readily available.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.480]   At a $45 million film or a $100 million film, I don't think that it necessarily adds up.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:56.800]   But as Art House, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million Blaire Witch Project kind of stuff.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.480]   But you're still left for the same problem though, where if you want...
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.880]   I use the word professional actors not as a way of insulting anybody who doesn't get
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   $500,000 minimum for a movie, but you're not going to get a Kevin Spacey, you're not
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.960]   going to get an Allison Janney, you're not going to get these people who have 20 or 30
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.360]   years with the credits behind them and can really sell a role when the entire budget
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.440]   is $2 million unless they can...
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.840]   But the whole machine that occurred before didn't have those actors either.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   And a lot of them...
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.720]   And there were a lot of tier one or two down, you know, it's the kind of the Rucker Howard.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   The Steven Seagulls.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.040]   The Rucker Howard was the king of a lot of these little films.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   And I'm a big fan of Rucker Howard.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.240]   He was recently Rucker Howard Fest.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   He was a Blade Runner, right?
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   He's a Blade Runner, but all these, he did these like, what was it?
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080]   Rucker Howard.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.080]   Some angry swords.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   Yeah, it's really, because it's really cheesy.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.880]   Everything was German, Leon.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.080]   No, there was something very fun about drinking whiskey and watching Rucker Howard.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   So anyway, so the...
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.920]   I'm going to write that down.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   That's my new motto.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.440]   You had a point all the time ago about how he is.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.920]   You see, you see, he's been in a...
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   So he did bit parts of the water.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.520]   By the way, many people don't know this, but he's made of gold.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520]   Solid gold.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   Yes.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   That's the luminosity of his talent wheel.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   You had an interesting one a while ago.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.080]   Before he moved up, I just want to clarify that I don't mean that you should have only
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.880]   have movies that have like big name-brand actors.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.080]   I'm saying that I think that we're going to recognize 10 years later that most of the
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.800]   really...a lot of the meat of these movies is based on having really talented people
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.120]   who aren't at a stage of their careers where they don't need to support, you know, four
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.320]   expouses and eight ranches in Montana.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   Well, but...
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.160]   It is going to be...
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.320]   Who can...what kind of a team can we assemble for two million bucks that are going to enjoy
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.240]   this work or even take a cut for this two months that are going to be working just to
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.800]   say that they worked on this really great project?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.520]   It's an interesting rumor going around that Jimmy Iovine is going to negotiate exclusive
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   deals for iTunes.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   And it'll be interesting to see if...because Alex has talked about this for years, whether
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.560]   Google Play, iTunes, Amazon started getting into exclusive arrangements.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   Just Netflix.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   Like Netflix has.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   And then...
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.520]   And then those markets start to open up because you have serious money behind just this
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   thing.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.680]   Bad for consumers though because then we have to have a bunch of different boxes.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.920]   So we could...like Apple, you have to have an Apple TV, really, right?
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.400]   I guess you could have a lot of us have it all at a time.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.000]   I have Netflix on my Apple TV and then I have Hulu and I...
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.080]   You can a lot of us are different than a lot of the world.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.080]   Yes.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.200]   But if you only have an Apple TV, you have most of those services available to you at that
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   point.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.000]   You know whether it's Amazon or...
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   No, it's Amazon.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   But it's not entirely...
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.040]   It's not entirely an Apple TV or Apple world.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   I just don't...
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   I see a world with...
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   You don't get Amazon?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   You're a lot of YouTube.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.120]   I see a world 10 years from now where there are going to be fewer bands like YouTube, like
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.040]   Coldplay, like Foo Fighters, where they really are based on having a huge album release and
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.360]   making a lot of sales that way.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.880]   I think there are going to be more bands that really will grow up starting with their first
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.880]   work at age 12, 13, 14.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   It's already happening.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.440]   Self-distribution.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.960]   Why do I need to talk to Jimmy Iovine?
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.280]   Why do I need to make a deal with him to release an album to one outlet when I can have the
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   entire internet?
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   And will that happen with films too?
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.680]   I guess it is sort of with YouTube.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   I think so too.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.760]   I don't think we've seen plenty of Jonathan Colton's in the music side of the business.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.480]   I think we're going to start to see Jonathan Colton's in movies too, people who can't...
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.440]   And we're seeing them already in the form of easily consumed entertainment like game
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   videos.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   But we're going to have people who can make short movies at a budget and with a realistic
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.920]   framework where so long as they keep making these regularly and build up their fan base,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.480]   they can't make $6 million per picture, but they can make a couple hundred thousand dollars
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.080]   every time they go up to bed and they go up to bed once every year.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.360]   So I think that's really the thing that's where it's going.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.480]   I've heard the same rumors about Jimmy Iovine.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.240]   I just don't know how that really plays into where the music industry is going.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.840]   He's the interface to the old school and that still needs to be supported.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.920]   And there probably will still be blockbuster movies.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.600]   Some guy in his basement is not going to make Terminator 4, but at the same time, I
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.480]   think there's going to be as there is in music, this rise of the independent and it's going
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   to be great.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   It's good for everybody.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.640]   And then people like you, Alex, who have the skills, who have the equipment of the crew,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.960]   you wouldn't make a major motion picture.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.440]   You might very well make a picture for YouTube.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.720]   I've been writing short films that we're getting very close as we slowly accumulated
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.280]   all the hardware that we need to do.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   That's the time.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.080]   So my interest was like, oh, I might want to do a feature film someday, but we have
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.960]   about 10 or 12 of them right now that are getting ready to record.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.840]   But the idea is that we're not interested in a whole bunch of money around the making
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.040]   of it and the process rather than just crowd sourcing opportunities, kickstarter and Patreon.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   Everything becomes easier.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.760]   And I think this is what, yes, this tells Hollywood, the old school, there's maybe some
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.360]   opportunities, but really what's going on is what's happening on YouTube, what's happening
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   on independent business.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.920]   And there are things that Apple and Netflix and others bring to the game.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.360]   There is press, you know, a lot of people tell you front marketing.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.840]   Well, front page, front page on iTunes is a big deal.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.680]   You know, like that's, that sells a lot of, a lot of stuff, you know, and Apple pressing
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   it, possibly running ads that there, that this is, you know, the next Taylor Swift.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.120]   And as hardware gets more comparable, like this hardware is enough, the software becomes
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.120]   more important again.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.240]   And then you want almost like gaming consoles, you want exclusives to drive eyeballs to your
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   service and that helps you promote all the smaller, you know, brands and bands and movies
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   as well.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:44.080]   Well, I think also of interest, the fact that the EU has forced Apple to offer 14 day, no
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.520]   questions, asked refunds for apps to app store and iTunes downloads in the EU.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.120]   I think that's just really missing.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.280]   It's the way it set up is, I mean, they've done refunds before.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   You could always go to iTunes, report a problem and ask for a refund.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.360]   But you, and for an Android for a while, you had a 24 hour window that you could return
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   an app, Windows Phone 2.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   I don't know what's happened on Windows Phone, but I think that still exists.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.000]   But on Android, they made it 15 minutes.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Yeah, it gets smaller as well.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.800]   Because developers complain it's not as few hours.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.760]   Now the concern is with two weeks is two hours.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.200]   It recently went back up to two hours.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.800]   The concern, of course, is in two hours, I don't think is a big deal, but 14 days means
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.600]   you could download a game, play the hell out of it or download us an album, play the hell
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   out of it.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.960]   Down on a piece of an app and get your problem solved and then not have this idea you want
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   to pay for.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.040]   Some developers too, because that money gets basically ripped out of them as well as it
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   does Apple.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   I presume this is something the EU forced them to do.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.800]   UK, Germany, Italy, France and other EU countries.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.680]   And this is for iTunes, App Store and iBooks purchases.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   I don't know.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.040]   I keep on thinking that EU is committed to keeping their countries as far behind as
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   possible.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.920]   The EU, it's very, you know, we've talked about this a lot on Twig, because as you know,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.120]   Jeff Jarvis is crazy about EU regulation of Google.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.040]   And probably rightly so.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.080]   One way you could characterize it is here in the States we have this great distrust of
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.960]   government.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.920]   And I don't know what it is in Canada, but in the US, distrust of government, but a
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.640]   trust of corporations, kind of in both cases a little bit unwarranted.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.400]   And in the US, the opposite, a trust of big government, but a major distrust of corporations,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.640]   particularly US corporations.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.200]   And I think that's what this reflects is just as with the Google stuff.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.120]   I just think we should just see how that works for them.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.040]   So Google presumably, Jason, would have to do this too in the EU, I would assume.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.400]   I think they have it available.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.440]   I believe that it said somewhere in the article that it's available.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   They just don't.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240]   They do it for music subscriptions.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   Okay.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.480]   The chat was saying consumers come first, but you have to maintain the viability of your
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   business.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.800]   And if any app you can buy, you can get a refund in two weeks.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.880]   People will just buy the apps, play the games and refund them.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.000]   And there'll be no money for people to make the future games.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.640]   There's a short-sighted.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.920]   And I think that the other question is that whether Apple decides to do, they obviously
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.320]   haven't here and Apple tends to just try to manage it.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.800]   But what if you gave developers the ability to publish regionally?
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   So developers could just say, I don't want to publish in the future.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   Yeah, they're going to check for now.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   That's what happens.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.360]   That's what they should do is allow developers to decide, well, I don't really want to serve
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.120]   you if they're going to keep on doing that.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   Because obviously things change.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.040]   If you buy a book, most books you can read in two weeks.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   So really, it's a library policy and it's free.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.880]   And if I'm an author, I might resent that a little bit.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.520]   And I may decrease the amount of content available in the year.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.360]   The great developers, people like Will Shipley, people who do like, if you write to them, you
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.800]   save your problem, they want to refund your money.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   They want to make you happy.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   They want to do this.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.480]   But they want a relationship with you at the same time.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.680]   I still think that Apple's policy in the States is wrong too.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.160]   There is no demo.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.440]   There is no return.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   You have to beg.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.880]   There should be a window of some kind where even if it's just an accidental purchase, you
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   should be able to quickly run out.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   Will Should we leave Twitter this week?
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.320]   I think put up a thing saying there's only two requests for that in the Apple radar database.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.520]   And you ask people to go in and duplicate it because if they don't see a demand, they
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   don't do it.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520]   A lot of developers.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.280]   Having movies of what the game is going to look like is not the same as me downloading
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.440]   it and saying this is terrible.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.720]   I think a lot of developers have adjusted to that where they are giving you a light version
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.000]   or an in-app purchase for free and paid versions.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.080]   That's the next, that's a new demo.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.720]   That just clutters the place.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   I don't know.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.120]   Well, I think that the two ones, I think the in-app purchase makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   This was the demo originally.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   Really?
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.280]   Yeah, because why did they kill that?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   Free would be free.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   So you could down.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   It wasn't that they killed it.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.200]   It's that they never allowed time-based demos.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.360]   They didn't want people to be confused about the functionality that you got.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.920]   The original idea was you'd get a level to try out and then the in-app purchase unlock
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.200]   additional levels.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.040]   But it turns out people don't pay to get rid of ads.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.680]   People don't pay to get extra levels.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.840]   They'll just play the first level then go look for the next free game.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.800]   You could argue that freemium was discovered that way.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.120]   The people said, all right, well, let me make a free version.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.160]   I mean, we've had it for longer than the iTunes Store, but it certainly came into its own
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.640]   with in-app purchases and free.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.000]   There's only two things we'll pay for.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.200]   We'll pay to get our car back on the track faster or to have a better-looking car than
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   Alex has.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.760]   We'll instant gratification and you go back on.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   Have you played trivia crack?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   It's the funniest thing.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   So this is a game my mom got me into.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   And it's really ugly.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.840]   It has a paid version with no ads and a non-paid version.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.000]   But there's always in-app purchases.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   They call it trivia crack because you play the game and you want to play and you want
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   to play.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.640]   You lose a certain number of games and you have to wait 45 minutes before you can play
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.320]   anymore or pay 99 cents.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.800]   And then it becomes a day that you have to wait.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   And so I just feel like this is a real...
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.720]   This is like I think one of the best solutions for it that I've seen.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   There it is.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   It's a fun game.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   I think one of the best...
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   Trivia crack, not track.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   Crack.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   Like the...
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   I thought that was your nickname for it.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   Like it's trivia track.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   No, it's trivia crack.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   Trivia crack.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   Trivia crack.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   It's...
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   Okay, all right.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720]   Friends.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.000]   It's got a big pipe in the front of it.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Don't start playing.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.480]   No, the...
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.160]   I think one of the best uses of this has been field runners where you pretty much play
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   the whole game.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.640]   You don't really think much of it.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.400]   But if you want more points to buy a little extras and you're not winning enough, and
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.600]   I have to admit that you never want some of what I just...
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   Do you do that in field runners?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   You buy a little...
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.440]   Like, yeah, it's horrible because I'm trying to...
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   I have this whole...
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.600]   But see, I feel like this is almost slimy because they're taking advantage of your own
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   week personal weekendy crush.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   I mean, a lot of...
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.160]   Like, all the games are casino model.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   Casino model.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   But I don't really have a problem with it because I'm just playing and...
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160]   Just a block.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   Oh, I do.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   Oh, no, it's important.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   I spent $200 on Simpsons Donuts.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   Do I have a problem?
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   Yes.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   I meant to...
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   I meant to...
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   Do you have an ethical problem with it?
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.360]   I still feel that there's going to be some point at which Apple is going to have to...
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.880]   Every time that they put that slide in the next keynote saying, "And we've handed over
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   $8.1 billion to developers."
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.840]   There's the Greenpeace guys out front of going to be shoved aside by the people saying,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.640]   "Yeah, how many people who have an addictive personality shoveled into that versus how
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.520]   many people who have the ability to not buy donuts are paying for that?"
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.080]   I think it's one factor among many that...
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.360]   I believe that in the next couple of years there's going to be a cleaning house of the
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   App Store.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.560]   A lot of policies that were made perfect since when they introduced it or things that
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.400]   will set it up this way and then make modifications as necessary.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.320]   That will work for a few years, but there's so many disgruntled developers about developers
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.600]   who don't have a real connection to...
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.040]   Don't feel a connection to their users.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.240]   As you say, the inability to get demo versions going, the inability to easily get refunds
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.360]   on stuff.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.080]   And now this idea where there really is a lopsided amount of revenue coming in from just people
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.120]   who are in iOS, Skinner boxes, just tapping buttons, you get a pellet, tap a button, you
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.560]   get a pellet, tap a button, you get a pellet, that they're going to have to do a lot of
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.480]   cleaning house in order to make this continue to work for the next five years.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.040]   A couple of notes from our chatroom scooter X says the 14-day period in the EU is extended
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.000]   to a year if a business fails to properly inform consumers of the return period.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So you've got to be very clear.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.080]   You've got two weeks to return this a year.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   And then...
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   That's Jeff in six who's in Sweden, right?
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.080]   He says, "You're thinking like the Motion Picture Association, Leo.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.000]   People are not thieves by default, and it is more expensive to not sell apps in the EU
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   than to offer refunds to a small percentage."
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.840]   I guess that's the question is how many people will take advantage of this?
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   Maybe you're right.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.080]   Maybe I shouldn't assume that people are going to do that.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.520]   My younger years I took advantage of a lot of that stuff.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah, but that's...
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.920]   I think the record industry says this too.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.480]   Kids growing up today don't buy music, but that's...
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.200]   I think those are people who probably wouldn't be spending that money anyway.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   You wouldn't have been spending that money anyway.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   But there's a translate to physical media.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.440]   If I go to Best Buy, buy a Blu-ray, a Guardians of Galaxy, bring it home, open it, watch it,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   and then go take it back.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   You could do that.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   And people don't do that.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   Well, it depends on how positive it can be open.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   It's a little harder to do that.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440]   It can't be open or it can't.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   There's all sorts of different regulations that...
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   It's pretty easy to push a button that says, "I want my money back."
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.440]   Delete this app, I want my money back.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.440]   Or delete this book.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   I don't know.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   We'll see.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   It's 99% of people start returning apps.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   I think a lot of people don't return stuff.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   I mean, there's stuff like I won't return which I should legitimately return.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   All the time I should return.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   I can't start.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.080]   I've got to find the box or Amazon's going to charge it.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.240]   And it'll be interesting to see how this is implemented.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.440]   Is it still going to be the report of a problem button where it's buried and you have to go
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.800]   digging for it and Google how to do it or is it going to be a big giant red button on
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.240]   every app purchase?
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.040]   Apple dominated Christmas 2014 in activations in app sales.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Very, very good holiday season for Apple.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:37.280]   51% of device activations were Apple.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   17% Samsung.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.960]   Oddly 5.8% Windows Phone Nokia.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.040]   This is according to Flurry.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.840]   What do we know that all the Nokia is Windows?
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   I guess it is.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   It is.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   Yep.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   All the smart stuff.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   There are a couple of Android.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   There's a weird Android thing but no, I don't think that's a good thing.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.640]   They didn't fire Tim Cook at the beginning of the year.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.640]   I didn't say they didn't fire Tim Cook.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   You did a haunted empire.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.160]   And app downloads were also big app installs.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.280]   Average daily app installs December 1st to the 21st one a day.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.840]   Oh, you got just a reference.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   That's the reference.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   I don't think it was.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   Was that reference?
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   That's the unit.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.880]   It was 150% more on Christmas Day.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   But that makes sense.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.360]   You get a new iPhone or new iPad.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.040]   You're going to install a bunch of apps.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.760]   Flurry Track two and a half times the number of app installs on Christmas Day compared to
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.320]   an average day in the first three weeks of December.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   You're right.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.120]   That's just a reference number.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.720]   Also gift cards are being activated.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.940]   And I should point out that Samsung is the big one here but there are probably other
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.940]   Android devices.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.960]   Well, there's LG and Sony.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:51.080]   I still obviously it all adds up to less than half since Apple has 51%.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.400]   Distribution of new devices by form factor.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.560]   I know this was really interesting to look at how.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.400]   Good because I explained this chart.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.000]   So your tan area is your larger phones.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.880]   The red area is smaller.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   Shrinking.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   Which is gone.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.120]   So the top bar is 2014, then 2013, then 2012.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.000]   And then you can see the shrinking small phones from 7% to less than 2%.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.040]   The dark blue on the left is full size tablets.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   Like iPads.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   Light blue is like the iPad mini.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yep.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   The green is phablet.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Giant phones.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   From 3% to 13%.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   Right.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.840]   And then but it's just amazing how the large phones and I find that my usage is the same.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.320]   I mean, I finally after complaining after saying I was not going to do it, I finally settled
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   into the 6 Plus.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   You did.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.000]   And I asked everybody this.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.720]   Do you find yourself using the iPad less?
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.640]   I find myself using the iPad mini not at all but I use the larger iPad now which I wasn't
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   using at all.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.040]   Well, this would be an iPad mini like a complete waste.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   This would support the rumor that there'll be an iPad Pro coming out this year.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   Right.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   It's much more likely to have an iPad.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.680]   Especially they slowly merge the OS's where I'm really just getting an OS that has a
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   detat.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.080]   What I really want is a larger iPad with a keyboard, like a pick a ball keyboard on
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   to it.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   You know, people make those all right.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   Oh, you want a Surface Pro 3.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Exactly.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   With the Mac.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   No, I wish I had one.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.280]   I don't need to kick stand.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.960]   But I have to admit, I look at the surface going.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   That is exactly what I want.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   Except I just want to go with the OS X.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   I just want to OS X.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.680]   I don't want to deal with Windows.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.400]   That was to do so much to the iPad.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   The 9.7 just to make it continue to be relevant because now there's I actually like found myself
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.240]   writing thousands and thousands of words just to work out my own thoughts about it and seeing
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.960]   under what circumstances were I would I continue to recommend a 9.7 inch iPad to somebody.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.600]   And it's not that I can't think of situations which that would happen.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.120]   But now it's like you walk through that decision tree as again, you imagine yourself having
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.680]   that talk with somebody at the Christmas Eve party and they know you're the tech person.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.120]   So I want to buy one of this, which I get.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.760]   And I keep landing on squares and say, well, it sounds as though you really do want an
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.680]   iPad mini or it sounds like you'd be really happier with an iPhone 6 or sounds like,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.920]   geez, you know that for just a few hundred dollars more or a couple hundred dollars more,
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.960]   you can get an iPad Air 11 inch.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.400]   That will do really everything that you want this iPad to do and way, way more and it'll
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.600]   be much more useful.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.440]   It's so hard for me to find the square that says, oh, yes, the 9.7 inch iPad is absolutely
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.640]   the right one for you.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.320]   And a lot of the reasons why aren't because it's it should be 12 inches or 7 9.7 or that
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.200]   it should have a detachable keyboard.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.440]   It's stuff like it should be easy to run to app side by side.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.920]   It should be easy to switch between two apps because this is the way to get a value out
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:45.280]   of that $500 minimum device is to offload some of your creative stuff and your productivity
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.240]   stuff off of whatever notebook you're using right now.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.640]   And it's such a pain in the butt.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   It really does require a bunch of commitment to really ultra light tablet computing because
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:01.560]   otherwise as soon as you put like a relatively lightweight 13 inch notebook into the picture,
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.920]   that 9.7 inch iPad tends to stay home a lot more than it might have otherwise.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.200]   And I think that again, I think that it's the I think that a larger one with a merge
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.160]   OS, you know, is the thing, you know, what I don't really want.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.480]   I just I don't think that works at all.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.440]   I was just saying that coming this is there is a iOS that runs side by side apps unless
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.160]   you drag and drop things between apps.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   That's probably the beginning of what you want the land.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.160]   You're not the end.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:33.480]   It's one of the things I like about Surface Pro is that I'm surprised that modern apps,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.320]   you know, their Microsoft Windows 8 multi touch apps.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.840]   I'm surprised there isn't a much bigger and better library than there is.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   But really all I really all I want is the ability to have one window that has a if I
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.880]   if I have as one windows, Windows 8 window, a pain, and then just simply a call next
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.320]   to it that simply has my Twitter client or simply has like something I can do.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.760]   Keep an eye on a movie or keep an eye on my inbox.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   That'll do me.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.640]   And so if all I had the ability to do was to take the iPhone articulation of an app and
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.560]   have the iPad articulation of a different app side by side on the same screen, suddenly
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.920]   my 13 inch MacBook stays home a lot more than it would.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.280]   The code is in there for iOS 8.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.760]   They do one third app, two third apps, one half apps.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   So we'll be happy.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.060]   And I think the number one reason I go to iPad to my iPad and now it's really with my
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.880]   with the iPhone 6 plus, I think that the the has become more of an issue for me is that
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.960]   number one reason I go to an iPad is because there's apps that only run on iPad, even though
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.680]   the resolution on my phone is plenty to support it.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.920]   You know, so the thing is, is it really frustrates me that I have to go to an iPad app, you know,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.120]   because it's only sold on like there's certain, you know, sketching programs and all those
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.400]   other that or some of the sound programs that I use that say, oh, they're only iPad,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   I can run them.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.160]   I mean, I could run them on my phone if they just didn't define it as an iPad app.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.400]   I think that's changing though, because I believe there's a rumor that you'll be able
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.760]   to target like iPhone 6 plus exclusively and make those big screen apps smaller.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.160]   I don't even know if I would use the iPad at all after that.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.360]   Like it's literally like the handful of apps that I can't use over, you know.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.640]   I'd love to know the thinking behind that.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.400]   Because to me, it's just insane that at launch, you can't design something and target an iPhone
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.320]   6 plus specifically.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.120]   It's like saying, yes, we put this amazing 10 kajillion horsepower engine and one of
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.800]   the most beautiful cars we've ever made.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.680]   But we also basically hardwired in this sale on the back of it that you cannot detach.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.080]   It's like, why did you give me the power of a big screen without linear developers really
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.880]   make use of it yet?
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.400]   Yeah, I don't think I heard I don't know if you'll be able to target iPhone 6 and 6 plus,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.720]   but maybe you'll be able to target just iPhone 6 plus if you want a big screen app.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.520]   It's not like there's like a hundred different iPhones out there.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.720]   It's a small enough sample size that if a developer really wants to create an experience
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.560]   for each of the, let's say, one, two, three, four iPhone sizes right now, they should be
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   able to do that.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:00.440]   I mean, I'd be happy if the OS just defined the iPhone 6 plus as an iPad.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.760]   I think that's a monkey paw wish where I would want it.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.440]   But then when my wish is granted, I'd be sorry I made that wish.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.700]   I think that it's an interstitial size that needs its own interface.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:18.660]   But when you see a big app that's been scaled for that, take advantage of that, boy, does
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.660]   it fly?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.280]   I really do appreciate the differences between like the Google Docs app and pages and other
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   text editors where you can see that although that wasn't targeting this size, when you
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.080]   see one that is just a harmonious balance of the interface and the editing area, that's
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.040]   when I'm, I look up thinking that I was just going to test out this little keyboard for
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.200]   about 20 minutes.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.040]   But I've actually written now for three hours because I really just was able to get into
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.360]   the zone because it's such a nice, nicely paired system of keyboard and hardware and
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   software.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.480]   Man, I love that split view controller on iPhone 6 plus in landscape mode.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   Really?
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   You use that?
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   I have an iPhone.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.480]   So this is, I'm using my iPhone and all of a sudden I turn it and I have an iPad.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   Turn it back, I have a phone again.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   And how many apps are now taking advantage of this?
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   No, we're nearly enough.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.480]   I think that's kind of the issue.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   A lot of the things...
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   Why are the USA stuff is very slow?
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   I mean, I've been talking to developers about this and there isn't a specific reason for it
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.880]   and developers are never hesitant to complain when they're unhappy about something.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.000]   It's just that for whatever reason, making an app not just compatible with iOS 8 but
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.360]   a celebration of iOS 8 is just not a high priority for them for some reason.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   No.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.200]   It's fragmentation, isn't it?
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.680]   Isn't that the word that Apple used about Android?
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   It's not fragmentation.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.520]   A lot of them will complain that it's become incredibly hard for them to repay that development
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.560]   cost that people won't pay for new designs.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.520]   They'll, they consider them entitled to them.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.520]   They have that...
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.600]   We have not enough people, but 6 plus to make it worthwhile.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.440]   Well, so last year iOS 7 was a huge thing and Tweetbot came out with an update to make
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.000]   it look like iOS 7 and they charged for it and people said, "No."
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "We're not paying for that."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.360]   And he said, "Well, user experience is the most important feature.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.840]   This is the biggest update we've ever done.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   It's completely...
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   No, no, it's just a new skin.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   I shouldn't have to pay for that."
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   I think a lot of people are unaware of that time spent in updating an app is money spent.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.920]   And that's one of the reasons why there was so much bad blood about the Switch to iCloud
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.840]   which was kind of forced...
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:23.080]   Excuse me, another addition ago because this was kind of forced on people saying that,
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.000]   "Hey, if you want to continue to have your app in the app store, you're going to have
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.360]   to support iCloud."
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.680]   And now all of this time and money was diverted away from the new features they wanted to
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   put into their apps and was diverted into making iCloud's thinking work and was just
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.080]   held together with Spitt and old twigs.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.440]   And it was just like...
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.840]   A lot of them felt like I just wasted eight months of development time on a feature that
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.280]   now I can't even use anymore because it just doesn't work.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.880]   And so that's why a lot of people might be a little bit gun shy to Renee's point to say
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.240]   that we can either continue to make our app work really great or we can invest a lot of
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.200]   time and money into supporting features that people are not really demanding yet.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.880]   And there are a lot of developers out there that are creatively intrigued by every new
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.440]   opportunity that Apple builds.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.880]   But most of those developers are not the people who are like, "I've got to payroll.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.760]   I've got to pay three people and I've got to support an office space.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.600]   And I have to figure out if I'm going to have my people spend three months working on something,
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.760]   it has to be something that users are absolutely going to relate to and pay for."
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.920]   Will we see a 12 inch iPad thing?
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   I think so.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.320]   I think it's the two gigabytes of RAM and the AI.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.280]   That makes a big difference, doesn't it?
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.040]   A chipset is a big clue as to what Apple's got planned for the iPad.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   We were talking at the dinner last night about Apple's long-term strategy and some
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.680]   two interesting hires that might tell us something about that Renee Richie has some insight.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.520]   Let's take a break and talk about our sponsor for the show today, personalcapital.com.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.360]   That's something I don't have anything.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.880]   You have no capital?
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.000]   You know what, Alex, how old are you?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I'm 44.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.760]   What do you want to retire?
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Never.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.440]   You may never get to retire because you don't have any retirement savings.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.320]   So personal capital is about just knowing.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.240]   You still don't have to retire.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   I have a lot of max.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.960]   It's just knowing what you've got, knowing where your money is, knowing if you've invested
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.160]   it properly.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.880]   The deal is, you know, I think this would be a great new year resolution.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   I'm going to eat healthier.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   I'm going to work out.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.120]   But more importantly, I think in the long term is make sure your money is working for
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.840]   you properly, that it's not being wasted on fees.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.960]   It's not being frittered away on management fees or your broker's fees.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.520]   Personal capital will help you do all of that.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.040]   It's free like that, personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040]   It's secure.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.600]   And it should be on your to-do list for 2015.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.480]   Seven hundred thousand investors are now using personal capital.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.320]   You get a complete, in fact, this is my personal capital.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.360]   I'm not going to show you all the details.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.720]   Although you could see I spent $15,000 on the host dinner.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.720]   No.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.920]   But you can look at your portfolio.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   You enter in all the stuff.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.400]   You can see how it's doing.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.720]   You can get an investment checkup, which is really fantastic.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:15.120]   See how it's going with the current asset allocation, how it's going to be in the future
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.680]   and compare it to a target allocation.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.520]   You've got an advisor that you can use if you wish, but you don't have to.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   Your retirement fee analyzer, 2% of earnings lost to fees.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.120]   That's not good.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.480]   Not good at all.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.880]   I don't live in Canada where the government's going to take care of me in my old age.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   No.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.720]   Thank goodness.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.880]   So here's the deal.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.280]   It's something you should try today.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   It's free.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.760]   You just go to personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   Set it up.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.960]   Put it in the accounts.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   It is absolutely secure.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.040]   You don't have to worry about that.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.680]   I'm telling you, you will be very, very happy with the result.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.640]   Personal, absolutely free, totally secure.

[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.960]   I've been using it for a while and I'm very happy.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.920]   Personalcapital.com.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.440]   We're talking at the dinner.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.800]   I hope this is not out of school to mention this.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.920]   No, I won't name them publicly if they don't want to, but because in general I think there's
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.320]   some interesting trends.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   What's going on?
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.840]   If you look at Apple in general this year and the things that were super public, like
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.360]   Kevin Lynch coming out and demonstrating, WatchOS.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.720]   WatchOS doesn't look like iOS 7.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.080]   They spend all this time making iOS 7 look a certain way and then making Yosemite look
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.280]   a certain way and yet WatchOS is something new.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   It's got a new system font.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.840]   It's got a new way of doing things.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.280]   It's got icons that look almost like Yahoo from the 80s.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.640]   It's really interesting.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.200]   It's a new design language and you add to that things like the 8X processor.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.800]   It's got not only a custom chipset but a custom graphics chip now too.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.240]   Eight cores on there.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.720]   Two gigabytes of RAM.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.480]   It looks to me like when you look at the kind of people that they're hiring and the kind
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   of projects that they're doing that there is a very large movement, start moving all
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.040]   this mobile technology forward.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   Extensibility.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.200]   It's been around a year already and not only does it allow us to do interrupt communication
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:00.040]   but it's a foundation for projecting information back and forth between iOS and the Watch.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.840]   Handoff is moving things back and forth.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.240]   I think when you look at that to Alex's point earlier, I don't think there'll ever be a
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.800]   point where iOS and OS 10 are merged because Apple really truly believes that these are
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.720]   separate operating systems but I believe that they'll be a point where it won't matter.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.640]   Where the device will understand our context and present us capabilities based on where
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   we are.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.840]   And the Watch is a great point.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.040]   If you have your arm out, if I'm just sitting here with Alex and I get a notification, it
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   just taps my wrist.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.320]   There's no loud buzz.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   There's no noise.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   So he doesn't know about it.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.840]   Then I tilt my wrist slightly and I get a short look notification, a little bit of information.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   I bring it closer to me.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.240]   I get the whole notification.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.320]   All of this works with handoff.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.760]   So if I see a small interaction, it's too hard to do on a Watch.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.160]   But same thing, it's not just cloud sync because in a cloud sync, I'd have to launch
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.840]   the app, launch the document.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   It would be in the same status but it wouldn't be in the same place.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.320]   This will just have that app there waiting at the exact same place that I was before.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.600]   And it'll let me move back and forth.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.360]   If I plug a keyboard in, suddenly I go, "Oh, now I have a keyboard."
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   Wow.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   And it'll understand.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.120]   And I think that's where Apple is maybe too slowly for some.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.160]   But I think when you look at all the clues we saw this year, that's where they're heading
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.600]   in '15 and '16.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.880]   It makes sense because it's the one thing it really does is it makes you want to use
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   all Apple products.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   Absolutely.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.000]   And I get left out in the cold like I buy an Apple Watch but now I have to use my iPhone.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.080]   And if I really want handoff, I'm going to have to use my laptop and my Apple laptop
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   and my iPad.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.720]   And suddenly I'm all Apple.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   And they reward that by making the experience this incredibly seamless and compelling for
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   you.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.200]   And I think that they're taking advantage of what used to be a disadvantaged for Apple.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.240]   Remember that back in the old days when Apple, because they owned everything, it was like
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   they're trying to develop everything.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.760]   But now they're, you know, what I think Steve Jobs started what Apple's doing now is when
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.520]   we own the entire ecosystem, it works better because we have, we have control of the hardware.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   So the hardware matches the software.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.480]   The software, and I think the one thing Apple's gotten good at that they weren't good at a
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.520]   long time ago, maybe, I mean, when I say long time ago, five to eight years ago, is
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.160]   that the teams are actually talking to each other a little bit more.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.200]   I think the reorg that was done and that was Tim Cook's goal, obviously.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.920]   I mean, sometimes I felt like I knew more about what was that what we're doing.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.280]   The guy who runs continuity extensibility for Yosemite also ran it for iOS.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.440]   So there was no more separation about the frame system.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.800]   It was one guy running a feature.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.760]   A lot of times you'd feel like you'd be talking to guys at Apple just at a convention or whatever.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.720]   And you feel like one team's working on one thing, another team's working on a completely
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   different thing.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.480]   And they're integrated, but they're not talking to each other at all.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.800]   Now, I think that integration is starting to show up all over the place.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.240]   There's another tweak to this in that not only does it help to convince people to have all
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:31.160]   Apple stuff, but it also convinces them to have every single Mac and every single iOS device
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.920]   running the exact same latest version of the software.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:40.040]   Because if you've got that one last iMac or you got, you know, your one last iMac or
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.400]   the one last MacBook that's running 10.9 or 10.8 or, God forbid, 10.7, that's going
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.560]   to tell you that, well, why can I access photos on this iMac that used to be able to share
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   it before?
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.160]   Well, that's because everything else is for everything's running Yosemite except for your
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.600]   one iMac that runs 10.7.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.160]   Oh, well, how do we upgrade that?
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.680]   Well, you've got an old iMac that doesn't run 10.10, but if you've seen a new red
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:07.440]   iMac, and I'm curious to see how this plays out because it's great if you walk into the
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.800]   store with your with your American Express Black card and you buy all new stuff.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.040]   But that's not necessarily the world that everybody works in.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.880]   This is a story that I'm sure is going to fall on familiar ears now that we're recording
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.760]   after everyone's back from their Christmas visits to like aunts and parents and sisters
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.600]   and brothers that you spend a certain amount of time in somebody's rec room taking a look
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.760]   at why is my Mac not working and the first the first thing you check is, okay, let's
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.160]   do a system version.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.000]   Okay, you're running OS 10.5.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.240]   Now here's why here's why some things are slowing down and here's why some things aren't
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   working.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.080]   And then you try to explain why they might want to upgrade and then you run into the
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.800]   brick wall of yes, but everything outside of outside of seeing a seeing a beach ball cursor
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.360]   every now and then this is working fine.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.320]   What problems I'm going to encounter once I start running something that's that's from
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.360]   this presidential administration.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:08.000]   So it's going to be it's the Apple has always had the wonderful benediction of we we plan
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   everything out.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.360]   We have everything working together extremely well.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.880]   A lot of that, however, is conditional upon you always having everything up to date.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.440]   And in the past two or three years, having modern software, it's just I'm just saying
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.600]   that that it'd be interesting to at some point discuss.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.160]   There is a wall I think has dropped down that wasn't there before in the Mac line particularly
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   where if you have a Mac made before not before then you're kind of left behind.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.760]   If you have a Mac made after then you're perfectly fine.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   It might be 2008.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:44.000]   It might be 2009, but it's something that I'm navigating in my office right now too because
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.760]   I've I still got an older an older Mac book that's kind of my bedroom Mac book that is
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   useful for a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.840]   It's got a green line of of longevity on the left side of the LCD, but otherwise it works
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   fine.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.880]   I've not updated it past 10.8, not because I've refused to, but because it's just never
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.280]   occurred to me to do so.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   And now I'm facing that.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.080]   Okay, I guess I have to upgrade this to 10.10 and let's hope that everything works fine.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.160]   I think Bluetooth LE was one of the big dividing lines for Apple though because they made it's
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   everything.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.720]   All the new stuff is so dependent on it that older Macs that don't have it really were
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.640]   a lot of power management allowed the network and stuff.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.920]   Does NFC change things too?
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   The way they're using it right now.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   I don't know if you say so.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.640]   Yeah, the way they're using it right now is just Apple Pay, but in the future, you know,
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.560]   it took me a year to make an API for Touch ID.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.760]   So maybe a year from now.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:38.920]   You know, I look at my Sony camera, which has I can move pictures off of it onto a smartphone
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.800]   using NFC and I couldn't do that with iPhone until the sixth game.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.160]   So if you look at what they're doing with the Apple Watch and especially CarPlay, even
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.320]   Apple TV is they've totally decoupled interface from device now.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.920]   The iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6 work because iOS is no longer bound to a pixel grid.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.560]   That interface just scales to fit the phone.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   It scales to fit the watch.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.920]   It scales to fit the car.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   Why can't we have camera play?
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.520]   So I get a camera and my iPhone knows it.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   And that's their philosophy because I'm like, do that though?
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   That's not an Apple product.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.840]   No, but unlike Samsung, Apple's never going to manufacture the range of equipment that
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.840]   a Samsung or an LG makes and they're not going to license operating system the way
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   Google are.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.800]   So the only thing they can do is take over interfaces.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   And I think they've shown with the Apple.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.960]   I don't have, it doesn't matter who's TV I have, I just take an Apple TV on their
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   an airplane.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.880]   It doesn't matter what car I have as long as it supports CarPlay, that Q and X system
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.960]   just gets totally overtaken by Apple.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   And in the future, if my camera can do that, my appliances could do that.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.520]   Apple gets to offer, yeah, all this stuff works better with Apple when manufacturers
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   have an advantage.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   It's a huge customer.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.960]   And I think that I think that a lot of the manufacturers see their interface.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.400]   The two things that I think that they see their secret sauce for their cameras, because
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.000]   a lot of these cameras are commoditized.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.280]   They're very similar.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.160]   They see their interface in the way that they manage the raw data as kind of their secret
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.720]   sauce, because they're all a lot of them using the same chips.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.120]   A lot of them are using a lot of the same features.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.120]   I think it's a mistake.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.520]   I think that a lot of us would love to be able to, and we've seen a little bit of Sony
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   experimenting with it by having a lens that just attaches to your camera, I mean, attaches
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.120]   to your phone, but there's a lot of us that would love to be able to run, whether it's
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.480]   our video camera or still camera, being able to have a graphic interface to change the
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.320]   settings and so on and so forth, I think would be very compelling.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.600]   I think it's a hard press to get these Japanese firms to give up that control.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.960]   But I think if they did, the first one that does it wins.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   There's a lot of iPhones.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.840]   There's a lot of iPhone users.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   Just look at how many installs there were.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.280]   There's a lot of iPhone users that would just be like, I'm not just a fan of them.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   A lot of pro photographers are using Apple Gear.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.120]   So a Canon or an icon goes along with this.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Look at the car.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   I have a Toyota that was before integration.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.240]   I said, "Can I just upgrade the sound system?"
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.680]   And said, "No, you got to buy a new car."
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Right.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.320]   And every time my phone is updated, every time iOS is updated, it's updated.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.920]   And the same thing could be true of all these other appliances.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   Do you think it's likely?
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   I do.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   I think that eventually someone's going to do it.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.240]   I think it's more likely when we look at video cameras, I think we're more likely to
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.720]   see someone like Red or Blackmagic or AJA provide that kind of interface than we're
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.280]   going to see Sony or Panasonic or Canon.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.520]   Well, and you'll never see Samsung because their goal is to make the entire line.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520]   Touch was everywhere.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:17.360]   I think that I'm very, very cheered by CarPlay because if there's a limitation that Apple has
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.160]   not proven they don't have, it's that they're great at making things that work with other
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.960]   things as long as they make all of the things.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.240]   However, what if you don't want to buy an Apple compatible camera?
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.120]   What if you don't want to buy an Apple compatible printer?
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.840]   What if you want this tablet that is not made by Apple to work with this Apple computer?
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.080]   Then you start to run into problems and butt heads.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.000]   So if Apple were to start to not just make this a way to reach the phone into the car,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.760]   but a philosophical way of saying we are never opposed to people buying whatever hardware
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:54.920]   they want, we just want them to have a safe and a very, very, very consistent experience.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.080]   If they're philosophically are starting to say that we want to start to make the transport
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:05.120]   technology that will let us interface between anything we have to anything you have, that
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:09.560]   would be one of the most, one of the best culture shifts or the second best.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.120]   Number one being people talking to each other inside the company, but the second best cultural
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.360]   shift would be for them to start to have an embrace and extend sort of technology.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   I wonder if there's an example.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.000]   The only one I could think of is printers.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.800]   Apple for a while made its own printers, the image writer and the laser writer, but stopped.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.000]   And they created an air print which seems to be well supported by the printer manufacturers.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   David Geltner, yeah, I did cut.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Yeah, I did cut.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   We don't have any like healthcare home kit.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.200]   Well, you can say that, but have nothing is yet doing working with a week away.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Okay.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   You think, ah, that's interesting.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.400]   I think where we start, I think where we start to see this.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.560]   Because there's been past book and now there's health kit and the home kit.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.400]   So as much as we make it, but will they come?
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.600]   As much as we make fun of Apple being too controlling, whenever things don't work as
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.080]   usually the parts that Apple doesn't control, like it took CarPlay was being worked on for
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.040]   five years before they could even announce it because the car company has worked so
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   slow.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.160]   The manufacturers now are a big hold up for home kit because they have to, they're actually
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   making physical objects.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.160]   Will we see stuff at CES?
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.160]   I think so.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   I think so too.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.680]   There's always been a big home automation pavilion and it's always been very disappointing
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.200]   because nothing talks to anything else.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.280]   And Samsung's, you know, Samsung's bought smart things and they're promising to put
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.880]   this into their appliances this year.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.920]   I think one of the things that a lot of these manufacturers have to weigh is that I think
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.960]   that home automation is too important for Apple to leave it.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.880]   I don't think it's too important to Apple to, if it doesn't work, if home kit doesn't
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   work, I think Apple moves into manufacturing home devices.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.480]   And I think just because Google's already acquired Nest in Dropcam, Google's making
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   a big play in this.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.200]   So I think Apple's kind of, I think I bet you somewhere in the back, in the back, you
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.280]   know, rooms when they're talking, it's basically like, you're going to develop this or we're
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   going to develop it.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   We'd be happy for you to develop it.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.240]   It's something we don't want to deal with.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.920]   But if you don't, we're going to just, you know, because if Apple built a Nest-like device,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:02.240]   you know, like an end of Apple bond, you know, it's amazing because it was Tony Fadel who
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   built the Nest.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.680]   It's amazing how careful they're being there because there's no home.app.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.040]   There's a health.app so you have an Apple front end to all the health.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.800]   Where is home kit?
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.440]   So you basically, when you make a home kit compatible accessory, your app has to be able
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.680]   to enable and set up home kit for everything.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.320]   And why has it he'd done that?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.680]   Why hasn't Belkin done that?
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.080]   A lot of these apparently are going to roll it out.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.320]   But the interface is strange because Siri looks like it's going to be the easiest, most
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   common interface for it.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]   I love that.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   Siri, good night.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   And then it turns off every day.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.040]   My country home, please make it warmer.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   I'm on my way.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   Right.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   The little sort of thing is look like they're coming.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.800]   And then you say, I'm turning heat up to 120 degrees.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   Enjoy.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   You know what?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   So, the E34 antenna is close to failure.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.200]   100% failure in 23 hours.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.040]   We replace the unit.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   And there is a problem.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.320]   I mean, when I first installed my Nest, it kind of went crazy.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.120]   And you would turn the heat up really high, then it would really blow.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.520]   And you would really accept that, right?
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.520]   People would say this is not OK.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.320]   I think there are a certain level of expert.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   We saw.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.880]   Also letting people install their own.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   We saw with CarPlay, though.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.760]   I mean, some of them had wonderful multi-touch screens.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.960]   Other, like, Ferrari had horrible--
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.720]   Is there incentive for Apple to do this after all?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.440]   Are they making money, printing money right now with their existing solutions?
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   Do they really need to--
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.960]   They've never been happy with now, though.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.360]   Apple's one of the few companies where like, you look at Apple as a contrast, Apple never
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.440]   mistook their products for their business.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.480]   Some companies believe like Windows, that's our company.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.840]   We're going to put everything behind it and we'll ride it into the ground.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.640]   Apple's like, yeah, we make iPods now, but that's just an instance of personal computing.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   That's going to go down.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.880]   We have to have the next one ready.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.080]   So you see with like the iPhones replace the iPod, the iPads replacing it somewhat.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.160]   They have the Apple watch coming on.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.720]   They're always-- they're really concerned about ups leading themselves.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.000]   And that's a good-- they don't maximize profits on any one product, but it means it's a company
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   that stays viable longer.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Right.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.320]   I don't think there's anything they don't add enough.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.160]   Well, they don't move fast enough for you and me.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.280]   I mean, I think that, like, for instance, the HomeKit thing, I think that-- we'll see
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   what happens at CES.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.600]   If a lot of people jump on to it, I think it makes sense.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:03.040]   But I do think that if we don't see a lot of people jumping onto the HomeKit in CES,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.520]   I think that Apple should just--
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.320]   You know, Apple TV is HomeKit Hub?
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   You know, basically-- because a lot of Apple users--
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.920]   I just feel like that the problem is that Apple makes proprietary solutions.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.880]   And so even if they're only-- even if they're at best half of the market and it's the US
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.000]   that they're half of the market, that's not 100% of the market.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.160]   And so it's more concerning.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.600]   And certainly for me, I don't want to have to use an iPhone to take advantage of all
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   this stuff, but I would.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.600]   But there's an enormous number.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   They want it too, but I don't want to.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.680]   And so if I'm another company, if I'm-- I don't know.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.800]   I won't say Samsung, but if I'm Frigidaire-- or I don't even know if they exist anymore--
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.880]   but if I'm another company, would I choose a thing that's going to lock me into a great
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   ecosystem in minimally Apple, but only half of my potential market?
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.880]   You're not locked in.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.880]   So that's the brilliance with CarPlay.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Is that it's running QNX, you could theory how to do it with that.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   It works without an iPhone.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.440]   It works with any-- they just want it-- Apple wants people to say the best experience
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   will be if you have an iPhone.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   If you don't have an iPhone, you'll log in, you'll use the QNX.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.160]   I would even-- if I'm Ford, I would even be reluctant to do that.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.120]   Well, they can implement Android in the car as well.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.040]   The thing is it's a completely modular system, as long as you have the base unit.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.040]   It's the same with the television.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.520]   I don't think you're going to see a third company, third party company in most cases
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   say the best experience is with Apple.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   Apple wants to say that.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   It's like--
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   I know Apple wants to say that.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.020]   Well, no, if you're television, like you can buy any television you want, put an Apple
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.020]   TV on an Apple.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.440]   We'll say, look at this amazing experience you get with AirPlay.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.600]   Samsung doesn't care what Apple's saying, they're making their own box.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.600]   And we can all complain.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.720]   The other-- the choice that you have here is when Apple starts to build-- if Apple builds
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:31.460]   it, it may not be perfect, but like-- there's a lot of things I complain about with Apple
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.460]   TV, the interface.
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.240]   It drives me a little crazy.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:42.000]   Until I got a Vizio 4K TV at Walmart for the house, and the interface--
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   They're all terrible.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   You're just like, I have my gosh, the Apple TV--
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   My class life has apps.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   You know you know you have ads.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   They have ads.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   They have a lot of trust rate.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.840]   Okay, but you compare that now to the Roku 3 and what's your experience like?
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.280]   I haven't used the Roku 3 yet.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   Yeah, see, it's--
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   Love the Roku 3.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.800]   Except it crashes once in a while, like a lot.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:05.320]   For me, I see a mysterious reboot maybe once a month, maybe a couple times a month.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.320]   Yeah, me too.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:12.720]   But the difference is that like my Apple TV is 100% reliable, 100% stable, because I don't
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.720]   turn it on, I don't use it.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.640]   Because I also have-- because I also have a Roku here.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:24.040]   And so it's an interesting kind of dynamic that Apple puts into play.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.840]   Like Apple is going to make the Apple watch.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.400]   It's probably going to be like almost all major Apple products.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.200]   At least 90% there, I would say 85% there at launch.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.920]   But everything that's in it at launch is going to work perfectly.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:48.680]   Meanwhile, Android Wear, the first range of watches, not really great, but boy, they only
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.960]   took a couple of months to get their act together with one firmware update and then now an update
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.320]   to the entire operating system.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.520]   So they're not afraid to iterate and maybe even screw up in public.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.840]   And so Apple does not want to do a really big update to the Apple TV until they have
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.800]   a lot of other pieces in place.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.080]   It's obvious that there's-- with all the hires they've been doing and with also just how
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   follow the Apple TV has been laying for the past couple of years, there's going to be
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.680]   a huge update in 2015.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.320]   But meanwhile, nobody should really want to use it.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.520]   All it delivers right now is airplay.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.600]   And meanwhile, Roku is just so much better.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.720]   Or even Chromecast, which is $35.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.880]   My problem offers some very interesting choices.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.200]   My problem is that when I can't find the controller, I have two little kids.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.920]   When I can't find the controller, I always know I can just pull my iPhone out and start
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   running the Apple TV.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   And that's another one reason I use it.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.440]   And I lose my Apple remote every day, every freaking day.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.160]   Fortunately, most of my remotes work with it.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.520]   I mean, for me, they're Apple remotes.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.680]   But for me, being able to open up my phone is the only thing I still get back to my TV
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.880]   because right now with my TV, usually I only have to worry about turning it on.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.040]   And once it's on, then I just run it with my phone.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.680]   Going back to if you imagine Apple TV is a home kit hub where it's doing all of the
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.640]   home kit supposedly works remotely.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.760]   You can be in Rwanda and control your whole house and stuff.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.440]   But that just means you have to have something always on in your house to try to really all
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.440]   those people.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.440]   Somebody will lick this.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.480]   The most sensible thing to be that always on a computer.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   I agree.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.480]   That's so.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   Somebody will lick this home.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   I just automation thing.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   I don't know.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.040]   Apple has an opportunity.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.480]   But if I have to have an iPhone and a Mac to make it work, the question won't work with
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.440]   my nest in my drop cam.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.520]   But but but still, I think those those the drop cam and the nest are still tiny little.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.560]   I mean, they've scratched the surface of their market.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.600]   Apple for my Samsung refrigerator, which works with my smart thing.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   There's different customers.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.400]   And the and the other thing to point out is that these are the nest thermostat is about
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.480]   three to four times more expensive than whatever you're going to get at Home Depot.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.680]   And when you talk about people who have the money to spend something like 200 bucks per
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.200]   thermostat, you are talking about someone who probably also has an iPhone and probably
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.640]   also has a MacBook too.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.240]   So that might be the way we're discussing might be kind of irrelevant to Apple.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.600]   Apple has the people who are willing to spend money for that kind of gear.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   That would make me sad.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   Well, it's a different kind of customer though.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.840]   Like Apple's never chased huge amounts of customers.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.680]   They're happy with a subset of customers.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.400]   And we have other companies like Google wants everyone to be able to use their stuff and
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.600]   Apple wants to be able to make things for people who just want to buy something and put
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   it again.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.600]   Good for Apple.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.400]   Not necessarily good for third parties.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.720]   We can choose the ways that suit our needs.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.720]   Always.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.720]   Go ahead.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:28.520]   Oh, I always whenever I hear that I'm I always feel the need correctly or incorrectly to interject
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.400]   and say that there are people who can't afford to buy the things that Apple is making or
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.400]   choose not to.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.680]   Well, or even choose not to is a different story.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.600]   But I'm saying that there are people that they can they can admire a MacBook from a
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   distance.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.560]   They can admire a three hundred fifty dollar Apple watch from a distance.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:49.120]   They could admire a five hundred dollar iPad from a distance.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.600]   But then it's like, well, let's let's go look my wallet.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.800]   Well, I've got three hundred bucks.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   What can I do for three hundred bucks?
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.360]   Well, you can buy this watch for two hundred.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.800]   You can buy this Kindle for 70 bucks.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.280]   So it's I think that Apple should be praised for a lot of things that has to be tempered,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:08.120]   however, with the knowledge that there is a whole economic class of people for whom
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:14.560]   an Apple product is only going to be an aspirational thing and that these people still need should
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.360]   have the benefit of being able to save money in their electric bill.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.000]   They should still be able to let their kids have a reading device as opposed to having
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.960]   one that has to be shared amongst the entire household is I'm just saying there's a big,
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.240]   big ball of data here and that no one part of it is more and more interesting than the
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240]   rest of it.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   There's a risk to Apple.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.200]   I acknowledge that this is a great business model except you don't want Apple Apple shouldn't
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.760]   want to become a golden ghetto where yeah, we have a very lucrative portion of the of
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.960]   the market and we're happy there, but it is it is a ghetto.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.960]   It is a silo.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.360]   It is a gated community and Apple has kind of pursued that all along.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.720]   Doesn't that I think that's just what's happened.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   I think they pursued it.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720]   I just need to go ahead.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.520]   When I think that they, I mean, I look at it.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.160]   So we do when I look at my service and I do we do a lot of live streaming.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.040]   We do not serve a there's a really small product project.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.960]   We just don't serve them like I can't do that.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.120]   You know, like I don't have a system in the same way I think Apple can't can't just can't
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.280]   do that and do what they want to do.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.680]   You know, you can't concentrate on that many things, but the the and we try to we think
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   about it, but we just then we go back to what we're doing.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:34.760]   So, but the the I think that there's a lot of people out there very comfortable.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   We talk about the Mac.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   But this comes back.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.120]   This comes back to the discussion of, for instance, the Sony camera and whether it would
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.080]   ever have a some sort of car play camera play interface to an Apple device.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.360]   And if I'm Sony, I'm probably not going to do that because it locks me into what what
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360]   Sony would do.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.880]   What Sony would do is build an SDK, you know, or or some kind of interface.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.520]   Like here is whether you're on Android or iPhone, you can interface with your phone.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.920]   These are the instruction sets that you can make calls to phone.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.080]   As a consumer, I would love that Sony the Sony camera would detect if you have an Apple
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.040]   device and offer you camera play would detect if you have an Android device and offer you
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   Android on the camera.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   Kind of does already.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]   That's what this NFC thing does.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.200]   Then you put Sony's app play memories on your iPhone or Android phone.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.840]   Still, that's a that's a close system.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.080]   But when it's a Sony system, what I'm saying is that what what you really want from these
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.600]   phones is you want to have a you want to have a serious way to call certain things.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.880]   I want my stuff to be everywhere because I don't want to have every device.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.720]   That's what I'm asking for.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.840]   If the car has car play, I can walk into it with my phone and have my stuff.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.400]   I don't have to worry about setting up something else.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]   That is the future.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.960]   That's what the cloud brings you.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   And that is absolutely.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.840]   But not just the cloud because the cloud does sync and sync understands the current
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.760]   state of data, but not the current state of my activity.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.440]   And that's what things like car play and handoff and all that is doing is it's transiting
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440]   our activity along with our state of data.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.120]   But cloud has given us that expectation that I can go anywhere with anything and still
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.640]   have my stuff.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   And I think you're right.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.800]   This is the next logical piece of that is what Torsten Hines was last out of the building
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.400]   for saying that mobile is going to be an end point.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.800]   Yeah, he was absolutely right.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   He's right.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.560]   You think of it more as you know, as an accessory, it's not.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.040]   And I think more time on my phone than I am.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.560]   Everybody does with the exclusivity thing though.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.040]   I think in Apple's vision of it, they're they believe that they only have the capacity
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   to make a few products.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.320]   If they tried to do anything else, they'll ultimately fail or make bad products.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.080]   But they're happy to let the technology that they make sort of be expressed by other companies
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.240]   and other areas.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.320]   So you'll always have like the Xiaomi's and you'll have the little bit of you have companies
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.480]   that say like look how many MacBook Air like laptops you can get now much more inexpensively
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.880]   from a wide range of currently not from Xiaomi.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.240]   According to according to nine to five Mac or call to Mac.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.720]   Luke Dormel says despite the blogosphere going crazy over this from gizmoquina.com.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.640]   This is not Xiaomi making a complete rip off of a MacBook Air.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   Xiaomi says no.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.960]   Their problem is that people are so ready to believe that and that's not the best thing
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960]   for them.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.960]   But they did it with the phones.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.160]   I mean they shamelessly copied the iPhone.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   Why not copy the iPhone?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.560]   Well like shame is a good thing to have.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560]   Right.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560]   Not in this case.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.560]   But it can't run out.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.560]   You know, here's a difference.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.560]   It can't run OS 10.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.360]   No, that's the same thing as a surface commercials, which was funny when they because they stopped
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.800]   marketing the surface against the iPad, started marking it against the MacBook.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.320]   But then said look, we have a USB port.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   Yeah, which a MacBook has.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.000]   What do you have a USB port?
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.800]   But it doesn't have a but you can't compare that with OS 10.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.400]   I mean, that's what makes these.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.080]   I don't like the competition as anymore because you can't.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.440]   They're not the sum of just fine.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   Head to head.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.720]   Yeah, head to head.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.080]   And so that so who cares if Xiaomi duplicates the hardware of a MacBook Air?
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.640]   Because they have OS 10.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   Right.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   Who cares?
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.200]   And in fact, let's face it, every single Windows manufacturer has made a MacBook Air
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.200]   clone.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.480]   That's what the ultra book is.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.080]   Which is why I think the surface adds.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.880]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080]   Go ahead.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.280]   No, we're all in the studios.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.720]   I think you're being put on the stuff out there on the east coast.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.080]   That's a little box.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.280]   I still have the remainders of my Christmas Eve Christmas day cold.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.440]   So perhaps I'm like John Travolta where they wheel the TV into the school room.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   Oh, boy.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.440]   Still.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.080]   I think it's probably boy.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.480]   You have a kindly thing.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:23.480]   Keep your pledge dollars coming in to help little boys like me.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:29.520]   I often have like not just thoughts about the technology itself, but of the attitudes
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.040]   about Apple, the attitudes about these products.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.200]   And I don't think that ultra books were really a copy of the of the MacBook Air.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.040]   It's merely the a direction those kind of things were naturally headed in.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040]   And I just I don't know.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.720]   I cringe a little bit when I hear.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.920]   I was going to see this because I think this is a half form thought.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.240]   I'm just saying that I often cringe when I feel as though we're putting a sticker, a
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.960]   gold star on Apple's forehead or a gold star on someone else's forehead when really we're
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.000]   they're just companies are trying to make successful products that they can make a lot
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.160]   of money off of.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.480]   And that will make their their customers very, very happy.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:16.080]   And if if a surface is being compared to the MacBook Air incorrectly and I think that's
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.960]   kind of an incorrect comparison, I agree with you, Renee, chiefly because if you can, it's
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.360]   like comparing it's like comparing an iPad to a MacBook Air.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.640]   The iPad is not going to compare favorably to that.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.280]   The iPad the MacBook Air is not going to compare favorably to that.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.640]   They're just such distinct objects.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.920]   I'm unfortunately at the end of my test cycle on the surface three, I'm going to have to
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.360]   send it back to Microsoft soon.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.920]   And I'm glad that I've had some deep soak time with it because what I appreciate the
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:47.000]   most about it is that this is so long as you don't want to have the standing in your lap.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.600]   If you're if you're in the situation where you tend to carry a computer to a coffee shop
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.080]   and then put it on a table boy, that surface is a much more comfortable thing to work with
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.560]   than either of the MacBook Airs that I've tried out.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.120]   In many ways, it's even more comfortable to use than the than my MacBook Pro.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.040]   But if only it had OS 10.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.600]   Yeah, I mean, if I'm saying that if Apple decided to make a kickstand screen with a touch
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.320]   screen that ran Mac OS, that would be my next Mac.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.120]   No question about it because every complaint that I have about my MacBook Pro in front
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:25.160]   of me right now has is related to the ways they cheaped out and cut corners to make this
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.920]   notebook profile work for them and make the size and the weight work for them.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.880]   Whereas if you have a detached screen and you have an Apple wireless keyboard, which
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.720]   kicks the butt of every keyboard on every MacBook that's available right now, and the
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.440]   ability to move the screen wherever you wanted to, that's an interesting idea.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.520]   And I'm glad that there are companies that are prosecuting it.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.360]   So I'm sorry to be babbling because again, it's a half formed idea.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.160]   It's just that I think that we need to move as the thing that that sort of bothered me
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.560]   over the past year or so has been this idea of we have to say that Apple is winning in
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.640]   some way or we have to say that Sam's at Apple's number or if you're on the other side of the
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.480]   conversation that Apple's numbers are not as significant compared to this, I just feel
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.440]   as though this is a wonderful, wonderful world of all kinds of great technology that helps
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.720]   people in ways that we can understand and ways that we will never appreciate.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.080]   And we should be happy for everybody who has something that works great for them and then
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   they have in front of them.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   Yes, indeed.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   Right on.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.040]   As Andy saw that, there goes Samsung Beats Apple to 12 inch fanless laptop.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   So there we go.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.600]   Samsung Beats Apple to 12 inch fanless laptop.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   Running Windows.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.600]   Yep.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.040]   Which is again, I don't, I don't, but I do think, remember you said that OS 10's Apple
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.440]   did start, what were they going to open source it first?
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.840]   I thought that's what I thought they should do.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   And then sell it.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840]   I thought what Apple do is.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:47.200]   What Apple do is is, you know, next generation of OS, yeah, with that's, you know, some iOS,
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.960]   I think, I still think within the next three years there won't be two OS's.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.600]   So you get that new merge when you take the old one and you just open source it and just
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   keep it.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600]   With that be nice.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   Wipe everything out.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.840]   You know, because it would, it would, it would cease to be the current OS and they say
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.160]   we're not, you know, we're not supporting it.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.160]   You know, like we're not.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.160]   You're not catalyzing your new stuff.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.160]   You know, really not.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.480]   And the way Apple moves forward, you know, and I think that because with, I think the
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.160]   new OS will not, and I really do think that the two of them are just, as you look at
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.720]   the different icons coming in, you know, piecing together.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.520]   I mean, I just feel like you, if you look at the long-term trajectory, you see two OS's
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.040]   that are pointed, you know, at an angle towards each other that would, you know, eventually
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.360]   you see more things that from the Mac that are on the iOS, you see more stuff in iOS
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.880]   on the Mac, you know, I think that they're slowly being merged together.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.840]   And it's not like Apple's never said that they're never going to do something and then
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.840]   do it, you know.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.720]   I think the quibble is whether they merge something or something new that has capacities
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.040]   for both takes this place.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.000]   Well, no, I think it's going to be something new, but I think what it's going to do, it's
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   going to be a-
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   It'll fill both needs.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   It's going to be a slope though.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   It's not going to be like suddenly they come out with something that's radically different.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.840]   It's going to be, we saw this coming and then one of these developer conferences this year,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.240]   next year or the year after, they're just going to go, "Man, we're really close together.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.840]   We just thought we just do one that works on every day."
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.520]   It's one of those wonderful arguments, like in 500 years will there still be iOS and OS
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   10?
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.160]   No, okay, well in 100 years, well in 50 years, well in 10 years.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.640]   Well, eventually that has to be right, right?
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.120]   Like, eventually we won't have these things.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   You're in one operating system.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.760]   It doesn't make sense to keep on supporting both of them.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   I disagree.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.720]   I do think that the Apple's breakthrough technology over the next two or three years is not going
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.360]   to be a new operating system, but simply a way of getting iOS and Mac OS to integrate
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:35.040]   and whatever it is that the Apple Watch is wearing to integrate and provide one seamless
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.600]   experience because that's something that everybody is going to appreciate.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.640]   It's going to be hard to teach somebody, to teach a Mac user, "Here's why your Mac now
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.600]   looks so much like iOS and so it's going to be so hard to teach an iOS user.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.240]   Here's why we added an Apple menu to the middle of the top of the screen.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.000]   I think that it's really going to be about let's continue to sell everything that we
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.520]   sell, but let's basically continue our focus on making one product that is known as the
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   Apple product.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.640]   I just think by the time you get to the point where they merge, you wouldn't have to teach
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.960]   anybody anything because there's so many similarities between the two OS's that you,
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.440]   you know, it was, by the time they merge it, it'll be almost almost be the same.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   But we'll see.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440]   Okay.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:17.360]   So getting the, we started this conversation with the idea that Apple is moving into a
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.560]   kind of a new world with perhaps more, is it, is it more mobile focus or what is it exactly
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.480]   that these hires are moving them towards?
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.120]   I think it's a, it's interesting.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.040]   I think again, extensibility shows us a lot.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.480]   It's a world where not every, where things are more modular, where things are projected,
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.640]   where previously with my iPhone and iOS in general, everything I had to go hunt for it.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.720]   And I feel Android was the same for a long time too.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   Like, yes, they had widgets on the home screen, but I had to leave my app.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.840]   I had to go to the home screen, find a widget, I had to leave my app, go to the home screen,
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]   find another app.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.560]   You always had to go chasing after what you wanted and then you had to find your way back.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.560]   Right.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.080]   And now we're getting this generation of apps where data is being pushed into other apps,
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.560]   being pushed into the system.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.640]   So I can be in one app.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.760]   I can pull down a shade, get all the widgets I want.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.480]   I can pull up extensions that give me the functionality right where I am.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.920]   So the interface has changed from being pull to push.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.760]   And as you do that, there's all these security implications that come with it.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.320]   There's all these OS structure things that come with it.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.080]   Because eventually, to Andy's point, as a user, I don't care where things are.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.000]   I don't care what this is running, what that's running.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.200]   I just want my stuff and I want it in front of me when and where I want it.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.320]   And that I think is capable of where we're starting to see here.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.560]   I think everything that we've seen this year is Apple creating decoupled computing and
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.960]   push interface.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.640]   And then Alex can have what he wants on whatever device he wants too.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.400]   Everyone's need is like it.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   I like it.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.160]   I wonder if I could ever have like Apple pushed into my Windows Surface Pro tablet.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.000]   Then Andy is the best of everybody's world.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.560]   If Microsoft says this is just a screen and you can project on to it.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.120]   I think Microsoft is moving in that direction.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120]   I hate to say it, but I have a feeling that's actually.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.160]   It's not remote for your controllers.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.520]   They package remote for users.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.320]   It's a super secure method.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.720]   And now they're showing that not only does that go in your device into other apps, but
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.200]   onto other things like watch.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   So why not?
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.760]   There's so many great reasons for having a Mac Mini on your network.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.640]   And one of them is to adjust being a Mac OS application server for all of your tablets,
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.320]   all of your laptops, all of your everything.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:15.480]   Because being Surface Pro 3 running remote access into a Mac Mini, that's part of a slice
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   of heaven.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   It's kind of an example of that here in the studio.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.560]   We use that Blackmagic router because we have so many cameras and inputs.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.880]   It allows 72 inputs and then you can program it for 144 outputs.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   And what does it run on?
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.680]   It runs on a Mac Mini.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.560]   And that Mac Mini is on our Wi-Fi network.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.880]   And I can control that from this laptop, from that laptop, from that iPad.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   Jason has an iPad that allows him to do all the switching.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.760]   And all of that's talking back to the Mac Mini, which is talking to the big switcher.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.880]   It is incredibly flexible and functional.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.880]   There it is.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   And when we--
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   That's awesome.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880]   And I can do the same thing in my office.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   I can do the same thing right here with the right software.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.520]   And when you have it something like a-- we do that with the Maraki systems where all
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   of our systems will plug in.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.920]   You can do that with any of our hardware anywhere in the world.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   It's all.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.440]   I can run the switcher in DC from here on my--
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.080]   In a way, that's kind of home automation, isn't it?
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   That's the beginning of home automation.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.400]   I have exactly one cable box-- one HD cable box with DVR in my entire house.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.640]   And because I've got it cooked up to a sling box, any time I want to watch it and any
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.960]   HD screen, I just simply activate the sling player app on my phone and then switch over
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.640]   to the Fios like remote app, Wi-Fi remote.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.400]   So I'm actually having a full function remote with one app while streaming via another app
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.040]   and be able to see it anywhere I want in the entire world.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.880]   I think an interesting factor in the next few years is that people are losing sort of
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.040]   obedience and fealty to whatever logo that they actually parked in front of.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.800]   They really are believers that I have Evernote.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.720]   Evernote simply projects itself onto whatever screen that I have handy to make.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.600]   And the fact-- and it works really just as well in a Chromebook as it does on my $4,000
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   gaming laptop.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.600]   And that's why I brought up the cloud because the cloud has introduced that concept to us.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.600]   It makes it-- on the other hand, we wanted to have Crestron controlled window shades
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   and stuff.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.640]   And that doesn't talk.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:11.600]   If that all talked to some central thing, then Jason could sit there and lower the lights,
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.360]   rotate the bed, close the shades.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   We could be ready.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.360]   We've got a little love here.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.960]   Jason's got some sort of body playing.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.080]   Jason, let us out.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080]   Ooh.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.080]   Oh, look.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   Oh, look.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.080]   But it's super easy.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.520]   It's like imagine you could have Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro just detect that you have
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.120]   iPhones or iPads nearby and push control surfaces to them.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.800]   I mean, there's all sorts of things they can do with now that they have this handoff
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   technology and extension.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.760]   All these little theftums in Crestron doesn't want to do that.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.880]   So what it's going to have to happen is somebody's going to have enough market share
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.920]   that they can say, look, it could be Google at this point.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   It could be Apple.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920]   It could even be Samsung.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.280]   Hopefully all of them will be wonderful, we're all.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.560]   But I still think that there's-- like when we--
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.880]   Dackler was Andy was talking about it.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.920]   I can go to Slingbox and I can do my DBR.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.160]   And that's great for us because we all do that.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.320]   The hard part is like, how do my parents do that?
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.040]   And I think that that integration is still something that is still geeky.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   I agree.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   And I think that the--
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   And the problem--
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.880]   If it becomes an Apple TV and it just talks to everything.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.240]   And I think that still, I think this market's too big for Apple to ignore.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.320]   So if manufacturers don't go down that path, then you see Apple start adding automation.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.880]   Like here's one bit to that.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.240]   And they're trying to show them that you could go down that path.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.720]   But they're also, I think, that is kind of a-- you go down this path and we go down this
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   path.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.880]   And when you got-- you're going to CES this year?
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   I'm not.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   You are, Marnay.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.760]   And Andy, you're going to stay at home because you haven't bought your tickets yet.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   Well, only because-- I did have this idea that I've been talking to friends of mine,
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.320]   like at the New York Times and other places where we're all just like staying home this
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.320]   year.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.160]   And I'm thinking that we should find some beautiful resort.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   I'll see you.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   And just like--
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   I'll see you.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.080]   Get a cabana with like a-- get a cabana just like-- if we're going to be just watching
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.680]   this through glass screens anyway, we may as well be on a nice beach while doing it.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   And you know what?
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   If we'll set like maybe two hours of the day aside where if people-- if product reps want
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.200]   to come and like executives want to come visit us, where we'll have the drinks cart,
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.480]   we'll have the beach, we'll look at your new home automation things as long as you're
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.560]   out of here by 20 minutes, we can be back to contemplate the--
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.480]   I've been thinking of moving this entire studio to Trinidad and Tobago.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   Maybe this is the opportunity.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   Maybe for next year.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   For tax purposes, but also for purposes.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.720]   I think I'm just going to-- what I happen to be doing for CES is sending someone with
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.720]   a lie-- with a lie here.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   Alex.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.600]   Just send someone and then I'll ask-- I have questions in their ear.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.400]   He has a camera on his head.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   Tell a presence, Alex.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   Yeah, tell a rutul.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.000]   We do have Scott Wilkinson going down.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   He'll cover TVs.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.960]   We have Father Robert who will cover anything that he feels like is an interesting thing.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.760]   Dick D. Bartol or a gadget guy will be down there.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.040]   So we'll have people down there.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.040]   I'll make sure Father Robert goes over to home automation.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.240]   And I hope you will too.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.760]   'Cause I-- and then we'll cross our fingers at maybe the solution is this year.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.720]   Although I've been going for 10 years praying the solution would be this year.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   And it hasn't yet.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.360]   I don't think the solution will be this year either.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.560]   I think it'll be next year.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560]   It's always next year.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   It's always next year.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.400]   But I pay TVs every year for three years, right?
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   But now 4K is-- I mean-- it took three years of CES.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   It did.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400]   But it's now $850 in Walmart.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400]   Just wondering.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.720]   So just-- your previous one is Fernerty Caldwell did an awesome article yesterday.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.640]   She spent holidays with her family and she's trying to introduce them to home automation.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.160]   So she got them to hue light bulbs and the so-nose.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.600]   She's setting it up for a mom and dad.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   So she wrote a sort of thing about how to introduce your families to all the stuff that
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.760]   you can do now in the home.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.880]   How did that work for her?
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.640]   I think it's still a work in progress.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.000]   But she's got the patience of the saint.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.440]   There's like sort of an exchange of like humoring going on during all these family visits where
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   you know, two days after Christmas, the adult kids are back in their own homes.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.360]   The parents have their-- have their home back to themselves.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.480]   The adult kids are now changing their hair back to the way it was before their parents
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   fixed it.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.680]   And other parents are like, OK, let's get this TV back to how I like it.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.720]   I don't care that-- I don't care that it's supposed to be optimized this way.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.560]   I don't care that I had the wrong aspect ratio.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560]   Damn it.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.800]   This is the way I like to watch the NFL.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.000]   Man, I'm so jealous that you snagged Serenity Caldwell.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.480]   She has become such a great part of I'm more.com.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   She's rough again.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.200]   And you guys did a round table in review.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   She hosted that.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.240]   That came out this morning.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:17.080]   And your favorite thing from 2014, she liked the WWDC 14 keynote.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.080]   I have to agree.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.200]   That was a great keynote.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   That was a-- and you said extensibility.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.400]   We've talked about that today.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.640]   Worst thing in 2014, Peter Cohen says anything colored in gold?
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   That's just a Peter Cohen comment.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.400]   And it's probably directed at people wear Bruins hats, quite frankly.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   I've had three mini-allies as Serenity says, "The return of the App Store review madness."
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.440]   Yeah, I have to agree.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   And of course, the bugs.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   You talked about the bugs.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   Let us--
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.440]   I have no iTunes this year.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.440]   That was the other thing that was a big surprise to me.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.440]   They--
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.000]   Oh, I was sure we were going to get a better iTunes.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.040]   So I was wondering if the integrating beats is something that pushed that forward.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.040]   That's what's holding up.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.040]   But there was no handoff for media.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.120]   It'd be great to be able to-- like, I have an iTunes playlist on my Mac.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   I start walking away.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.120]   It just takes over on my iPhone.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.200]   Every time we say this, the chatroom and people send me emails saying, "What's wrong
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]   with iTunes?
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   I love it."
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   It's so broken.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.200]   iTunes on the cloud.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.200]   Well, yeah.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.600]   The out of date thing is tough because it was built in an era before all the modern frameworks
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   existed.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.800]   So you think, like, there's iWork on the cloud.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.720]   Now, iTunes on the cloud, it solves so many problems.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.640]   They'd have to do what they did with iWork, though, I suspect, which is start over.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   Modern web technology.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.560]   People are still bitching about the fact that iWork lost so many features.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.680]   Yeah, so Apple's not afraid to do binary compatibility at the price.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:28.160]   But supporting the PC specifically is no longer as important as it needs to be because the
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.160]   cloud can do a lot of that stuff for us.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.160]   And iCloud sync.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.160]   iCloud, all these things.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.040]   Although, yeah, and the iGas and iWork, I have to admit, we tried to go to keynote,
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:41.280]   you know, because I wanted to stop using not keynote numbers on the web, you know, their
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   web version.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   Like, we'd upload a file and it was not a usable.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.280]   It's not that usable.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.920]   Because we, you know, Google, there's parts about Google spreadsheet that make us absolutely
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:52.920]   insane.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   Yes.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.840]   You know, and you get used to building, whether it's Excel or Google, you start building
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.240]   spreadsheets in Excel or you build them in, and I'm not talking about heavy calculations
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240]   for your financials.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:11.440]   I'm talking about organizing budgets, you know, budgets for events or whatever.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.960]   It is so much faster than numbers.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.720]   It's not even, it's not worth, like, if you just do it in numbers.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.200]   But if you actually use the web interface, there's so many features that aren't there.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.840]   I mean, it is like, it literally is like cutting, like, for your fingers.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.520]   I talked about this with John Gruber on during Fireball, sorry, the talk show this week,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.600]   is that Apple is a very strange organization.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.520]   Like, iWork is all done by ed.q's organization.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.520]   It's not done by Craig Figuri and the software people.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   So is the iTunes app.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520]   So are all these things.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   They have their own marketing.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.000]   There's a lot of different organizations in Apple that still haven't sort of been mushed
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   together.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.160]   And I think that one of the ways of getting iTunes in the future is maybe breaking down
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.640]   those walls as well.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.360]   Just fire everybody in the iTunes group.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.080]   Yes, it's like what we're talking about with the Apple TV.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.240]   Meanwhile, this thing just gets sicker and sicker and sicker and people get less and
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.440]   less interested in using it and they start looking at more alternatives.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:02.600]   I just, if I really wish that Apple, we could grasp the idea that you have to really keep,
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.560]   you even need to cultivate the plants that you think you're going to be ripping out in
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.040]   three years anyway.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.960]   Because until, if you just rip them out to begin with, you just have this big bear patch
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   that looks ugly and this point.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   Well, they do the swift thing, right?
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.760]   Like, you don't hear about it for five years and all of a sudden, they announced it at
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760]   WWDC.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.120]   Well, no one was looking for, was relying on the swift thing that they hadn't actually
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.200]   released yet.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:29.040]   People have to rely on iTunes to manage their devices.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.200]   And it's so bad that it's like, oh, I know I have the ability to-
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.880]   Why doesn't a third party write in iTunes?
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880]   Why is it the-
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.080]   It's the whole argument like email clients, everyone thought, you know, Apple makes it,
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.960]   it's terrible, but it's good enough that there's no money for anyone else to make one.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   And double twist try it.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960]   I mean, they wrote a-
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960]   Right.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.760]   There are people, but not enough to think it's viable business.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:52.080]   And you look at Google Maps, which is far superior to Apple Maps, but still 60% of Apple
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.520]   iPhone users are using Apple Maps because when you click on the link, it takes you to
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.520]   Apple Maps.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.480]   One other story that we'll get to our picks of the week and that was Apple last week pushing
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.680]   its first ever automated security update.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.520]   You all got it whether you said yes to an update or not.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   It didn't ask.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.280]   It just did.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.480]   And actually, this was a good one.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.920]   This was a fairly severe flaw that it fixed.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.880]   We're angry when they take too long to update stuff.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.280]   We're angry when they start pushing out updates.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.920]   Well, the good news is this update didn't seem to break anything.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.240]   The next thing you know, they're going to be sending us albums over iTunes.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.680]   So it went out, I guess, last Monday.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:33.760]   It fixed a critical vulnerability in OS X in the network time protocol or NTP.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.360]   They didn't say exactly what it was fixing, but it was in response to a security bulletin
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.040]   from the Department of Homeland Security and Carnegie Mellon.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.200]   So you figured it's fairly serious.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:49.560]   We know that NTP has, for instance, been used by bad guys to amplify DDoS attacks.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.920]   I don't know if it's related to that, but it is a vulnerability and it was fixed.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.200]   So is everybody automatically have it?
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.040]   There's no way out of it.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   You just get it.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:06.760]   I know I got a little note at the beginning of Monday that said you haven't, you've been
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   updated.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   No reboot.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.760]   No, because that was a good thing.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   Didn't need a reboot.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.160]   No, as far as I know, I mean, there might be a way to go in and disable those things in
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.320]   the future, but it's for years, people have been saying that Apple's not responsive enough
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.320]   to security.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.080]   It takes them too long to put out patches.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.760]   This one they had to put out apparently.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.760]   Yeah, and they did a critical thing.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   It was a zero day.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.200]   Well, and I think that if we look at what happened at Sony, if we look at what happened to all
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.880]   these other things, I think being able to react quickly to security breaches are going
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.040]   to be more and more important.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.240]   By the way, this capability was added two years ago.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   Right.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.760]   Did we cover the fact that, I guess they said that it's Sony.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.080]   They said everything's shut down except for the Macs and the iPhones.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.480]   No, they said the Macs and the iPhones were fine.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.280]   They're still working because the hacks were against Windows machines.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.720]   Actually, we're going to talk about that in about 20 minutes.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   Steve Gibson's in studio.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.800]   He's down for the New Year's Eve party as well.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.680]   And security now is coming up and Steve is going to review the year in security.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   What a year it has been.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   And ended with a bang.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.240]   And he will answer the question.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.760]   So was it North Korea?
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.840]   But time now, no hints.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.440]   Time now for our picks of the week.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.240]   And I guess we'll go left to right.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240]   How about that?
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.400]   That means who's left?
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.000]   Army left.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.400]   My left or your left?
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.400]   Stage.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400]   Stage left, Andy Inaco.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   Okay.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.680]   Or is he stage right?
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.680]   He's stage right.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.680]   But that's okay.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.280]   You have to have a theatrical background.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.280]   I don't understand this.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.760]   And upstage is where?
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.480]   Downstage is where?
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   I don't know.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.480]   Left.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.120]   At least just as long as you don't mention the name of the Scottish play, I think.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.920]   All I know is Snagglepuss.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.080]   Exit stage left.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.320]   So stage right, Andy Inaco.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.400]   See, serenity wouldn't know that.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.840]   Mine is a cheap, the intersection of cheap, useful.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.560]   And tiny.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.480]   This is the miraculous Hutu Travel Nano.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.480]   Hutu.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480]   Hutu.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.200]   Tripmate Nano Wireless and Pocket Travel Router.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.200]   What?
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.880]   That's so small.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.840]   It costs all of 17 damn dollars on Amazon and elsewhere.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:13.640]   And it is a fully capable 8 to 11 all the way up to N router.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.480]   But it also is just packed with all kinds of really cool features.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.240]   So starting with form factor, it's powered by Mac or USB.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.200]   So you don't have to pack another travel brick.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.360]   You probably already have a brick that will power this.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.560]   Also, if you want to have a truly mobile router, that's okay.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.840]   You can also power it from whatever, like, anchor or whatever battery pack that you have
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.920]   for a phone extender.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.240]   But it's not so it'll do customary things like plugging an ethernet port and now great
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.480]   and now it's a wireless access point.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.200]   But you can also use it to bridge one wireless network to the other.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.760]   It also has a USB port built into it.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   So I just want to back up there.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.560]   So you said bridge one wireless network to another so you can receive and broadcast
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.720]   a Wi-Fi signal.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.880]   I have to double check.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.640]   But I'm going through.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.360]   I just got this two days ago and I've been running it through all kinds of different
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   interfaces.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.120]   And then I had other devices connecting to this.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:21.000]   So apparently, yes, it must have multiple radios.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.080]   That is something I absolutely did use yesterday.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.920]   So I know that's true.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.920]   But it also has USB so that if you plug in a storage device, you can turn this into
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   a server.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920]   It works with...
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.600]   It's not necessarily a NAS, but it works with Samba.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.960]   You can also through configurations set it up as a home media server.
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:48.120]   So if you have a drive that's full of MP4 video files, you can stream those video files
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.280]   to basically anything that can connect to this.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:28:01.920]   It has a really good sophisticated web 12.0 based main administration tool.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.200]   It's just one of those things where you buy this, you put this in your travel pack and
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.120]   if you're traveling with your MacBook Air and you thought that this place was going to
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:15.680]   have Wi-Fi, it was going to have a Wi-Fi, but you can't get Wi-Fi in that part of the
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.880]   hotel.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880]   That's okay.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   You're not screwed.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.840]   You can basically put a Wi-Fi base station inside your room.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.840]   And you can do things...
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:22.840]   Go ahead.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.320]   The reason that I was so excited about the whole...
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.560]   It can bridge wireless networks is because at a hotel, you can defeat all of the multiple
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   devices.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.880]   You would link this to the hotel and then all your devices linked to that.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   Absolutely.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.120]   That should work again.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.680]   I definitely tested that last night and that worked fine.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.920]   The fun part is to go to the Amazon page where there's a whole bunch of...
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.920]   What are these different?
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.680]   Is the one, two, three and four?
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.080]   Of who choose?
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.480]   I believe this is the O2 that I have here.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.480]   Okay.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   This is the...
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480]   Oh, four is amazing.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.920]   HT-TM O2.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   If you go to...
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.560]   They also have the TMO3 and the TMO4 on the...
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.440]   TMO4 will take USB sticks.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440]   This one should too.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.440]   What is it?
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   Yeah, it has USB...
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.360]   And the beauty part is that all the packets are automatically routed right through Beijing.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.520]   So think of it as a cloud backup.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:24.000]   I didn't run a trace road on the packets, but for $17.99, you have to expect a certain
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.800]   amount of espionage at this price point.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.640]   I think you'll agree.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   But it's well worth...
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.520]   955 customer reviews at 4.5 stars out of 5.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.520]   It's been around for a while.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.400]   So there's a lot of active discussion about different ways that people are using this.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   And it really is...
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.560]   The people are using it for ad hoc wireless gaming.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.200]   If you have one of the things I wish that my Chromecast could do is I wish I could just
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.280]   simply plug this into the TV in my hotel room and now just use that as a wireless point.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.440]   So this one, you could just simply use this as your intermediary between whatever device
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.200]   your Chromecast is from to the Chromecast device.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   But it doesn't have an Ethernet jack or does.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.200]   Holy shimole.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.200]   Holy simoleons.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.000]   So if you don't have the latest Chromecast off, I think the latest actually can do an
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   ad hoc.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.760]   I have to double check on whether that works or not.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   But I just love these ideas where it's not the first travel router you have.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:26.960]   I used to travel with an airport, a airport, a free base station with me.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.560]   But it comes down to, well, why wouldn't I want to travel with that?
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.640]   Well, because it's too big.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640]   Well, this is not too big.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:34.280]   Well, because I don't want to spend $100 on something I may or may not need.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.640]   Well, this is only $17.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.520]   Well, I don't necessarily need to have Ethernet to Wi-Fi transmogification.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.840]   Well, that's cool because this will do other things too.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.720]   Like the ability to move files and videos from whatever you've got onto your iPad.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:54.840]   Because it has an iOS app, it has an Android app, and so long as these apps are on any
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.680]   of these devices, it can connect to whatever this is connected to via USB.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.760]   So it just seems like a really good thing just simply buy it, toss it in whatever bag
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:09.480]   that has the bag of wires and stuff that you take whatever trip you go to.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.480]   It will come in handy.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.400]   I still remember a couple of different conferences I've been to where because this is back in
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:21.040]   my airport, the airport extreme days where someone's complaining, "Oh, God, I've got
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.200]   to file three stories."
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.880]   But my room is the only room there's no Wi-Fi and I only have a MacBook Air and I got to
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.080]   the Apple store and buy a cable now because I didn't bring the dongle with me and I said,
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.080]   "Oh, it's great.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.840]   I got Wi-Fi in my room and when I just lend you my airport," and it's just like life-saver,
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.840]   life-saver, life-saver.
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.400]   So this can really get you out of a jam really, really quickly.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.600]   So it looks like the difference in models is how much extra battery it has for charging
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.000]   phones with other devices.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:56.240]   So the 04 has two USB inputs.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   It has a 6,000.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   USB charger.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.800]   It'll charge your other mobile devices and it plugs into the wall.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.400]   Oh, this doesn't plug into the wall.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.400]   It's charged by USB.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.720]   This is the $1 one right exactly.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.880]   And that's why it's this big as opposed to...
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:12.880]   As big as a power AC...
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:20.640]   And they do have some caveats, for instance, it will not bridge iPhone hotspot, for instance.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.240]   You can't use it as a bridge.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.760]   But boy, that's really good.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760]   1799.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.240]   I have to admit that I bought it on a complete flutter.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.040]   It does look like a win.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.240]   It seems interesting and if it turns out that it's a piece of crap that doesn't work as
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.960]   advertised, I'm only out 18 bucks.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.880]   But I've been spending like the past day or two say, "Oh, it does that.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   Oh, wow, that works great too.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.880]   Oh, wow, I didn't think that the administration panel is going to be that nice."
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.600]   I would not run a full network on this for in my office, but again, as something you
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.880]   keep inside your shaving kit and you always have it with you when you travel, it's pretty
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:56.880]   nifty.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:57.880]   Hooto!
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   Tripp mate, you can get it on Amazon or just search for H-O-O-T-O-O.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:06.520]   Also on Newegg, but Newegg as well.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.080]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, what have you got for us?
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.520]   It's Christmas, so I pick two.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.520]   Pick two.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.520]   Why not?
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.160]   They're both on the iPad.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.280]   The first one that I wanted to pick, it came out right when our show was two weeks ago,
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   I think.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.200]   So we didn't, I didn't talk about it.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.200]   I was excited about it.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.320]   Have you seen, have you played it all with duet display?
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   No.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   Oh.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   You've heard about it.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   Oh.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.320]   This lets your iPad be a second display.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   Another monitor.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.320]   I'll only see if I can get it.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   Can you do it?
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.520]   But the, how fast is it?
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.600]   I mean, I was, so you run the software in your iPad.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.200]   And you plug it in via USB to your computer.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.680]   Yes, you take your lightning bolt.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.680]   Lightning.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   Your lightning connector.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680]   Cable.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.680]   And you connect it up to your machine.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.240]   Alex Lindsey is now plugging a USB cable.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.240]   Upside down.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.440]   Into his MacBook Pro.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.920]   The other end of the cable is going into my iPad.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.520]   Let's see if Job says this is the wireless age in which we don't use wires anymore.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.520]   Well, and that's the whole thing.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.520]   It's cute.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   Like, that's a cute thought.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   [laughter]
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.400]   You know, but, but the delay on all of these wireless ones has never been, you know, really
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.400]   acceptable.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.400]   You know?
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:16.040]   So as soon as I don't, if you got copper, why not take all the advantages of copper and
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.040]   eliminate the problem?
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.040]   Crash the tricaster.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.040]   Now I'm the only channel available.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.840]   It's going, we're going to be staring at Andy while you do this.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.480]   Now I can reveal the reason why.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.880]   There he wants to be in Petaluma on this particular day.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   [laughter]
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.280]   Anyway, so as soon as you plugged in the duet, the tricaster said, well, that's it.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.200]   I give up.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.200]   [laughter]
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.240]   So the, so you're able to run a second scroll.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.240]   Look at that.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.240]   So.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240]   It's true.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.400]   And you're, you know, it's, show the, show the camera because they can't see over your
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.000]   shoulder.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.040]   What's not on?
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.560]   The Alex's rear shot is not.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.760]   So he has to show, has to turn around and show that camera.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.760]   There you go.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   There we go.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760]   There's my monitor.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760]   That's his, that's his test.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760]   I'm able to.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   But your desktop has gone dark.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]   So you have to set up your ring.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   No, I know what.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.080]   I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do that before.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.320]   I think it's because I didn't run the app.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.080]   I just plugged it in and it's, so you plug it in.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.600]   So you run an app on the desktop as well as on the iPad.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.920]   Yeah, I think you have them, but when I just plug, I literally just plug this straight
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.920]   in and it works.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.240]   Now, the thing is, is that a lot of times for us, we want to have this, you know, we
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.960]   want to have this at, you know, I love the idea, even if, you know, of just having this
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.960]   mirror, I mean, not mirror, but send it over so I can just sit there and interact.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.840]   This gives you a sense of what your, what you said.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.920]   Is that an air two?
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.920]   Air one.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.920]   Air one.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920]   Air one.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.920]   So it is suggested that you have a faster iPad.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.720]   But it works, you know, and I don't know.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.840]   Well, you get more, you get more, obviously more responsive.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.840]   More responsive.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.400]   But I found that, you know, when I'm, when I'm clicking on it, I don't feel like there's,
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   you know, a lot of delay.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:48.080]   It's very odd to see a OS 10 desktop on your iPad.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080]   I must say.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   Pretty awesome.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.080]   I must say.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.240]   So anyway, do I just play it's a much like 15 bucks, I think, or something like that.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.920]   And it's, you know, again, as a separate monitor that is now in your bag, like you want another
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.840]   monitor for a display or whatever, we are going to use it for things like telepromptors
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.160]   and stuff like that, where you can, there's a lot of telepromptors that work with a second
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.160]   display with iPads.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160]   But I never wanted to use the wireless.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.440]   It wasn't, I didn't trust it.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.400]   And so now we, I can now hook, hook, hook went up into the little, these super portable
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.040]   telepromptors like it.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.640]   And so anyway, so then the second one is called light bot.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.160]   Have you guys seen light bot at all?
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   New.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   Okay.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   So this is for kids.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.640]   And, well, you said Malcolm loves this.
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.800]   So Malachi is Malachi things that, I mean, he has gotten through most of the, the, the
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.160]   levels and seven and he's learning programming.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.200]   And so, so what it does is it all it does is you have to like, you know, if you have
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.440]   to turn the light bulbs on and see now P1 see that's a subroutine.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:46.800]   So it says literally do a, do this, the little thing down below and then go back and do another
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   do do that.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.800]   And so you're building it.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800]   He's learning how to build subroutines.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.480]   He's learning how to think about instruction sets.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.080]   He's, you know, and it gets more and more complex.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.440]   And what I was amazed by is watching a seven year old go from the really easy stuff to
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.320]   building all these very, very complex moves and he's thinking it out and he's also thinking,
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.360]   well, I'm going to test that.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.080]   And then he's going to, so the whole test process and this looks like I would like it.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.800]   It's a lot of programming.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   And then look at this.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.760]   So he's got condition, there's conditionals that's named that are built into it.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.480]   And so you can decide to do, you know, and so the thing is is that it.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.280]   So there's two versions, one for four to six, four to eight and one for nine and up.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   I got on both.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   So which one does he like?
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.280]   He's using the nine and up.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   Of course he is.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.240]   So, so the above average.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.680]   He jumps back and forth between the two of them, but the nine and up one.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.400]   I want this.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.880]   It's a really, really fun.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:38.880]   It's a really fun app and you're sitting there just kind of playing around with it.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.760]   And but when it when you think about teaching kids how to program, I feel like this is something
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.120]   they can be doing when they're seven or eight years old.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.320]   Maybe they don't start typing any code until they're until they're 10, which is when I
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.720]   started, you know, typing code.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.760]   But if I had done this before I had started, I would have been a, you know, it's all that
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.960]   flow charting for the old folks.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.040]   You know, when you had to build flow charts to think about how you're going to write a
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.640]   program, this teaches you that thought process of building flow charts and making decisions
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.640]   in a much more interactive and fun way to do it.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.320]   And so on it is on the app store.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.000]   So it's on the desktop, but you could get it.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.560]   Can you get it for iPhone as well?
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.920]   I don't know if I, I only put it on my iPad.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920]   iPad.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:16.920]   And you know it was on the desktop.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:17.920]   It is $4.99 in the desktop.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:23.320]   Now does the teach kids about the app store approvals process or do they want to grow up
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   with hope?
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.760]   That's going to be in the in the light bot pro.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.680]   You know, so in two to eight weeks, you'll find out whether or not your solution works.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.840]   But it's, you know, it's exciting a lot of times after that.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.680]   A lot of times we were trying to figure out whether, you know, is it really worth, you
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.440]   know, as a parent, you want you to give your kids a game that they're actually going to
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.440]   play.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.440]   And then you, I've installed a lot of apps that my kids, like I think, oh, that'll be
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.240]   very educational and then they don't touch it.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.240]   Right.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.920]   But watching him over a couple hours just kind of cruise through this and get really excited
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.920]   about, you know, doing that, I think is, it's pretty exciting when it comes to that.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:04.720]   So if you've got a, a younger, I think for a grown up family and even for grand grown
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.160]   up, I mean, it's a great way to think it's a great way to start thinking about programming.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.000]   Anyway, so I bought it.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   I'm playing it.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.360]   60 puzzles, 20 stars.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.400]   You can learn procedures overloading.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:25.200]   You mean it has object oriented programming to loops, conditionals, challenge levels?
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.200]   Wow.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200]   I like it.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:31.320]   I was amazed at how educational I was like, Oh, I don't know how complicated this is
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320]   going to get.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.320]   It's just going to be a couple of instructions.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.760]   But when you start getting the conditionals, when you start having the proceed, you know,
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:43.480]   the procedures, which are really subroutines, it's, it's pretty exciting.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.920]   I am light, but when you're done, read instructions, good luck.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.320]   Go main forward.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.680]   I got to do three of those, right?
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:57.440]   One, two, and then get the light now play towards the light.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.000]   I can do it.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   Towards the light.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   Power of code stuff.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.280]   It's there are other programs like this to tinkerer is another one.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.520]   There's some really neat stuff out there.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520]   I think this is fabulous.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:14.040]   I am going to walk two, three steps, turn on the light and another stamp.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.000]   See it's not that hard.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.760]   You ain't still there.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.760]   You didn't get it.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760]   I didn't get it.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   I left out another.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   I left out of the light.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.760]   There we go.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   Yeah, visit.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]   This is fun.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.120]   All right, light bot.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.000]   It is available on pretty much every platform.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.640]   I see Android in the windows phone as well.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:39.200]   It's just not possible that someone has not built Minecraft using this platform.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.880]   Your turn, Mr. Renee Richie.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.760]   I have two.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.840]   Next one is Procreate, which is a wonderful, it still is a wonderful iPad drawing app.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.120]   People who use the paper app, it's great for sketching things.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.640]   But if you really want to do art, Procreate is fantastic.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.120]   They released Procreate Pocket now for the iPhone as well.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.440]   You have the largest green iPhones.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.160]   This is an example what we're talking about.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.880]   Now the canvas in your hand is so much bigger.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.920]   They've put all the terrific tools.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.480]   It's savage, interactive and incredibly good development house.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.280]   They've put all of that onto the iPhone.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.560]   On the iPhone 6 Plus, it's just fantastic.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:15.400]   Yes, the digitizer with the stylus would be super nice Apple at some point.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:21.760]   But even with just finger painting on or using it, the multi-touch styluses, it's a terrific
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.760]   app.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.360]   You can draw illustration quality work on there.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.560]   Really, really great.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.360]   The second one, I feel a little bit dirty for recommending, but I was at the Twit party last
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.880]   night and nobody had heard of it.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.360]   So I feel it's everybody.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360]   Oh, I love this game.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.240]   It's a game called Crossy Road.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.880]   The title is Like Clappy Bird, but the gameplay is like Frogger.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.560]   You have a tremendous amount of characters.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.960]   You start off with a little duck.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.960]   You can get frogs.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   You can get dark lords.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.320]   You can get unicorns.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.760]   There are in-app purchases, but the developer is totally not optimized for them.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760]   It's Frogger.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.760]   It is Frogger.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:53.760]   It's an 8-bit Frogger.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.760]   It's sort of parallax scrolled.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.760]   They go with Frogger.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:00.360]   Yeah, it's gorgeously done.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.040]   You can in-app purchase more characters if you want, but if you're willing to wait five
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.600]   minutes, they'll give you so many characters that you never really have to buy anything.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.320]   You know, Frogger was a brilliant game.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.320]   It was transformative.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.640]   And I think it's time to bring Frogger back into Minecraft.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.040]   And so this, if you're looking for just a time waster over the holidays, trains.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.200]   And it is like Flappy.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.080]   You start to get a little ways and you get hit by a truck and you start again.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.800]   So it's Rage of Mouth advertising.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.160]   People get so upset that they tell their friends about it.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.560]   And then everyone wants to try it to see how far they can get because they can't possibly
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.840]   be as bad as their friend.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.480]   And then they are and they get squashed and they complain about it and more people and
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   more people.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.560]   The reason I'm watching this, I just think, you know what someone should make is a really
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.560]   graphic Frogger.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.560]   It's graphic enough.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.960]   No, but I'm saying, you can, I bet you that do really well.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.200]   Yeah, you can get it in the App Store and it is the latest game to hate on iOS.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:54.000]   And rightly so, me thinks it's called Grossie Road.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.160]   Helpline Industries, another thing generating that can be but one.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.160]   So I got these.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.160]   Yes.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   It did.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160]   It tried to cross the road.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.200]   If you're watching live, you might want to take advantage of a great deal for today only
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:15.040]   on Amazon, which is that SanDisk is offering or Amazon is offering or somebody is offering
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.120]   some like 50% off on SanDisk SD cards and micro SD cards.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:23.240]   So camera folk might want to take advantage of this.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.400]   I bought a couple of 128 gig ones.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.400]   They have up to you 10.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.800]   They don't have the 40 megabits.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.840]   I don't see the 95 megabits per second.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.840]   Super duper extra fast cards.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.120]   There are few that need those.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:42.680]   I remember when we started looking at the SDXC stack and just going, there is no way
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:45.800]   anyone's ever going to put 64 gigabits on a little bit.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.840]   They got 128 gigabytes on a micro SD.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.040]   I think the most significant move is that now there's enough capacity on each one of
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.200]   these cards that now I'm terrified of.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.880]   It's more than I'm willing to lose on a single card.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:43:59.880]   That's right.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:00.880]   That's right.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.600]   I seem to have topped out on camera cards at 32 gigs because I might try to swap out
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.280]   then lose two weeks worth of pictures.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:15.400]   So up to 70% off SanDisk memory cards on Amazon today.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.680]   I think that's worthwhile.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:21.560]   My other recommendation is something that Jason Cleanthes told me about.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.280]   Our newest producer, Effin Dunn, is Decal Girl.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:30.240]   She makes decals for your laptops.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.440]   And Jason took some of our wallpaper art and turned it into decals for the laptop.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.480]   This is my favorite, actually, Lisa.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.960]   And Jason, you want for Jason bringing your laptop over?
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.000]   You can get it for any size laptop.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.800]   This is 25 bucks for the-- it's from Decal Girl.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.440]   And I think the Twit logo is-- if you search for under custom decals, you search for the
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.360]   Twit-- go ahead, bring around here, bring around here.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.320]   You search for the Twit circuit, Twit-circuit.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.320]   It really is nice.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320]   They have magic.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.320]   This is matte.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.920]   And there's also a high gloss finish.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.080]   It's 25 bucks for the MacBook Pro 15, but you can get it for other sizes as well.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.080]   And thank you, Jason, for making that available.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.440]   And I got these as stocking stuffers for my kids.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.680]   And Lisa has one on hers.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.640]   And I think I'll probably put this one for the New Year's celebration.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.640]   I'll put this one on my-- and there, you know, is that 3M material?
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:25.640]   It's easy to remove.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.640]   It doesn't look great.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.640]   Pull it right off.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640]   Doesn't it look nice?
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.640]   This part of the show is always so expensive for me.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640]   I know.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640]   I know.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640]   I bought the Hootoo.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:34.640]   I bought the game.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.640]   I bought them all.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.640]   I bought them all.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640]   I bought them all.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640]   Thank you, folks.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.640]   We have completed the last show of 2014.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.640]   And for those of you and many of you in the chat room, we're saying, are they live?
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.640]   You know, we're all doing really doing that?
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640]   Are they live?
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640]   Zombie Macbrae.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.240]   Is this real life?
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.240]   We do Macbrae.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240]   We need to see.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.240]   This is just--
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.240]   Caught on the land side, just a break from reality.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.240]   Open your eyes.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.440]   Look up in the skies and see.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:09.680]   We will be here tomorrow, as you all know, for a very special event.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:12.200]   We're going to do a 24-hour broadcast.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:19.000]   As we did last year, the 24 hours of 2015, welcoming the New Year, starting all the way
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:26.040]   from New Zealand, going all the way to Samoa, 27 time zones, 24 hours.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.840]   It begins at 1100 UTC.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:34.960]   That is 6 AM Pacific, 3 AM Eastern, 3 AM Pacific on New Year's Eve, and we'll continue for
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.560]   24 hours after that.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.040]   I know you probably have plans for New Year's Eve, but if you can come early, stay as long
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.960]   as you feel like it, can't promise you that every fabulous thing that happens, and there
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:50.320]   are many fabulous things planned, which I don't know about because they haven't told
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.320]   me.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.520]   But I can't promise we will make them all available for downloads.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.640]   So try to watch as much as you can, and it all benefits UNICEF.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.520]   We've already raised more than $2,000 for UNICEF from people who just discovered the
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.080]   listings.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.080]   We have FESAs.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.880]   We have lots of things we're going to be selling and giving away.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   FESAs are cool.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   I love the FESAs.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.720]   Thanks to FESA Rama for providing those.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.720]   Rama will be there.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.720]   Me too.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.720]   Yep.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]   Yep.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.520]   A lot of our hosts will, Steve as well.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.520]   We cleared our studio.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.480]   I will be there remotely.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.280]   And had they contacted you, Andy, have the producers...
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.160]   I have not checked my emails since the show started, but again, the producers will reach
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.160]   out.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.680]   I will be here for whatever time we want me to be here.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.120]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.000]   We will be back with Mac Break Weekly next Tuesday and every Tuesday in 2015, 11am Pacific
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.640]   2pm Eastern time.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:44.160]   That would be 1900 UTC.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.600]   If you want to be live in studio, as these good people, so many of them are, you should
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.080]   just email tickets at Twit.tv.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.640]   We'll put out a chair for you.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.320]   If you're early, you'll get a good chair.
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320]   Otherwise, you'll get that one.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320]   You get the bad chair that goes.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320]   The naughty chair.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]   Not so comfortable.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.760]   We call them the iron and iron-paid chairs.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:02.760]   The young ones, red chairs.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.160]   I picked up on that right away and I appreciate that reference.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.160]   You too.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:10.160]   You're like peas in the pod there.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]   What else should I say?
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:16.120]   If you can't be here live in some form or fashion, all of our shows, I can't promise New
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.600]   Year's Eve is going to be done this way, but all of our shows are put out on demand
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.600]   after the fact.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:27.200]   Twit.tv/mbw for Mac Break Weekly or on iTunes or wherever you get your podcast, the podcast
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.880]   app, and of course, the great third-party Twit apps that our wonderful developers have
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.320]   made on all platforms, including iOS.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.680]   Thanks for being here.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.120]   I'd say get back to work, but surely none of you are working on December 30th.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.120]   Go out and party.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.120]   Go out and party because break time is over.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.120]   Woo!
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.120]   Thanks.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.120]   [applause]
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   [music]
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.120]   [music]
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.700]   (upbeat music)
