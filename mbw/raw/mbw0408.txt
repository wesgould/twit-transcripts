[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   It's very kind of you to say.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   I give the editor of IDG, creator of the incomparable

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   But the Tech Hive.

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   Got it.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   So here, ladies and gentlemen, from iMore.com,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   from Canada, Montreal,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   Renee Ritchie Ritchie.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   JUANET FETNACIONAL.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   Leo, happy Quebec Day.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   Is it Quebec Day?
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   It is.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   It's Saint Jean-Baptiste, which is Quebec Day.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   It's a Fettnacional.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   Do you...
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   So he got his head chopped off.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   Salome delivered a platter to...
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   He's a painter, Saint Quebec.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   So they made today the National Day.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   Okay.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   I'm just trying to think.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   So it's a public holiday.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   Mmm.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   Public holiday from Canada.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   And here from New England and the Chicago Sun-Times,
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   the Master of the Celestial Waste of Ben with Andy.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   I have no idea.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   In Not Go.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   You have to choose your catchphrase very carefully because
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   it's something that you feel as though you can be saying for the
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   rest of your life.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   No.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   I think In Not Go is a hard one.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   I...
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   Mox Chanel, easy.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   Ritchie Ritchie.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   But I don't know what to do with it.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   He's getting angry.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   No.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   No.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Again, I don't know.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   I have no idea how to spell it out.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   Ron Pullillo had to be happy saying, "Oh, Mr. Cutter for the
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   rest of his life.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   I'm quite careful saying, "I don't know."
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   I don't know.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   So, um...
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   Apple had the first word in the month of June with WWDC Google
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   to have the last word with Google I/O.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   Interesting article in Quartz.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   Tim Cook is setting Apple up for its neck.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   It's a big hit, Dad Fromer writing.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   But he isn't getting the credit he deserves.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   And I think this is kind of an interesting analysis of
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   WWDC and what we are all doing, which is waiting for I something.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   I don't know.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   I mean, Jason had a great article on Tim Cook before
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   WWDC, um, a lot of people who came today.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   Same thing.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   You said the same thing.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   It depends who you're reading.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   If all you're reading is mainstream publications, then
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   you're getting an incredibly distorted view of Apple, in my
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   opinion at least.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   But if you're reading people who cover Apple, who've been
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   covering it for years, then you're getting a good view.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   And the view being Tim Cook is preparing us for the future.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   Well, we don't know.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   I mean, we don't know all the details.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   I think it's part of this is we are trying to tell the whole
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   story when the whole story has been told.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   Exactly.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   My point last week was we haven't seen it yet.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   Right.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   But I am encouraged by the fact that Apple is trying to do things
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   differently and the things they do may not end up being successful
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   or not.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   But I think if they were not visibly trying to do things
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   differently, if they were visibly trying to just sort of like,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   well, let's not rock the boat.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   Let's keep it as much static from Steve Jobs's era as possible.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   I think that would be like 100% guaranteed failure.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   And there's some people who don't believe that.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   And you could we can say demonstrably that's not what they're
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   doing.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   No.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   And after WWDC, it is even clearer that they were not.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   I mean, the Beats acquisition is a good example of something I
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   think that wouldn't that's a new part of the playbook.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   But I think the developer centric announcements at the
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   developer conference were the thing that made it clear this is
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   a different Apple.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   And some of my PR interactions with them are very different.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   Some of their product rollouts have been very different in the
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   last couple of years.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   It's there they are doing new things, which they haven't done
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   for a while.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   Yeah, I think that I think they've come out of the desert a
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   little bit over the past over the past year.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   Definitely the big highlight of WWDC was returned for me to the
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   perception of Apple as a company that makes one product and
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   that one product is all Apple products and they all work
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   together really, really nicely.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   It really did seem as though a lot of these product lines and
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   all these services were starting to drift apart a little bit where
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   it wasn't quite so emphatic that, hey, if you've got an iPhone,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   oh man, you really you're really going to want to use iCloud or
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   wow, if you use a MacBook, you're going to want an Apple TV
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   because wait till you see how these two things can work
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   together.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   And it became a search.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   Things hadn't gone completely south, but you really had a lot
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   more options because it seemed to be a lot of trade offs of
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   going with all Apple than others.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   And now it seems as though everybody's talking together.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.500]   Everybody's figuring out a way to make all their products work
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   together better.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   And even if that weren't the case, if all the new Apple did was
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   keep the power on, keep the keep the water on.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   If you've the speaking from personal experience, the local
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   utility company has done a lot of upgrades to my neighborhood
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   over the past five or six years where I could like where I say
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   could expect one major power outage a year that would last
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   more than one day.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   Now it's been two years.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   We're hopeful.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   And just because you don't have like hovercraft in the garage,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   it's been a great time to get the power out of the garage.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   And so I think that's a great thing.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   And I think that's a great thing.

[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   And I think that's a great thing.

[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   And I think that's, I don't know if it's the goal.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   I think it's a strong possible result of this.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   And just the idea that you can walk up to your Mac.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   I should say also, this is about iPads and iPhones
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.500]   working well together.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   It's not just to the Mac.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   True.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   And it's for developers too.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   Because even though it was harder in many instances,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   at least based on my read, Apple used the,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   they created these features the same on both devices.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.500]   They could have taken shortcuts in iOS, shortcuts in OS X
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   that would have resulted in lack of compatibility.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   But the way it's implemented on both is through tremendous effort
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   is very similar as opposed to AirDrop in the current generations,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   which are the same feature with the same name and don't work together.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   It's totally different technology.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   It's incompatible.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   So the reason I bring this, go ahead.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   And let's not forget about the relationship with developers.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   Over the past two or three weeks, now that more developers have had
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   exposure to their own contacts inside of Apple and their own exposure
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   to the videos, even if they weren't at WWDC.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   A line that I'm hearing in various flavors is that it feels like Apple
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   and I are both fighting in the same trench now.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   It doesn't feel as though they're going to frag us just to make a point
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   to the competition of exactly how bad ass they are,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   which has been sort of a problem over the,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   it's historically been a little bit of a problem.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.500]   iCloud burned a lot of people and left a lot of people gun shy.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   Now I think most developers I've been speaking to have been talking about
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500]   the opportunities that iOS 8 is bringing to them as opposed to the
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   obligations and the burdens that iOS 7 were dropping on them.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   Do you think that the $650 that Microsoft is offering MacBook Air
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   owners to trade it in for a service for three?
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.500]   Is this a response to continuity?
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   I really like there was a joke on tech news today about the surface
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   to air missile or the air to surface missile.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   I like it.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   Surface to air to surface.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   I think it's more of a response to IT departments that might have
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   a closet full of MacBook Airs that they're supporting and the idea
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   that we got to get some surface tablets into this department just to sort
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   of start the infection going.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   You need to have what?
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   You have to power on your MacBook Air has to be working
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   in condition.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500]   You may not trade in water damage to cracked screens.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   Well then it's not worth it.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.500]   That's all those were strict.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   It has to work.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   I'm trying to figure out which air is--
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   Fyasty Microsoft.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   It might be any MacBook Air.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   Fyasty Microsoft.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500]   I like Fyasty Microsoft.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   Fyasty.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   One thing I wanted to mention that we skipped over but I think it's
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.500]   really important and you know Gruber and Geinler mentioned this last
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   week and I'm sure Jason and Andy saw it but Apple employees were so
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   happy.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   They were palpably happy.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   Interesting.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.500]   Huge change from some of the previous.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   I mean that you--
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   That's a good sign.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   There's so much mingling that happens before WWDC and rarely were I
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   hearing so many people saying oh my god this is going to be a big one
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   because Apple's you know there's there's there's sort of synonymous
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   with bold statements but they and the interactions that I've had
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   with Apple even Apple PR rarely do they go for big banner sort of
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   here's how we here's how we're going to advertise the new the new
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   bold flavor Pringles.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   They usually don't say stuff like that so that would that really put
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   me on the edge of my seat and damn if they didn't deliver you
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   right it and it does reflect.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   Maybe even a new optimism throughout the company that if the
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   company wasn't wasn't foundering and they weren't you need to do
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.500]   better than to simply be doing okay and to be able to point to
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   profits I think now they are pointing to here's our here are
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   great things that we're working on over the next one two and five
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.500]   years that's going to keep me at the company for the next one two
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.500]   and five years because I want to be around as these things get
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   built.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   I think it's in the last few years the feeling that I've gotten from
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   Apple is that it's an organization that knew it was doing
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   really well and was really afraid of screwing it up and I don't
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.500]   get that now this is this is an organization that is confident
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   people who work there are confident and they are doing these new
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   things and they're doing it with confidence this is definitely
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   not coming from a place of fear like they're panicking and some
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   people in the media have portrayed it that way and I can tell you
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   it's not like that it's not like that for the Apple developers
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   and it's not like that for the Apple employees they are
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   confident that they're making the right decisions here and they
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.500]   might not all work out but that's a good place for Apple to be is
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   confidently making what it thinks of the right decisions in
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   order to succeed.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   So since the WWC Amazon is an answer phone direct
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.500]   competition for the iPhone and maybe setting the table for the
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.500]   iPhone 6 and of course we're going to hear tomorrow from Google
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   what do you think Apple employees and and the heads of you know
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   the executives are thinking at this point are they about the
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   Amazon phone for me at least is it's only for Americans on AT&T
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   who are hugely invested on Amazon Prime.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   It's pretty limited isn't it yeah.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   Yeah and that's so that's nothing for that.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   I mean the Amazon experience is great on iOS it's pretty good on
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   Android so maybe you know that famous Microsoft thing maybe a
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   year from now two years from now it'll be interesting you know
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.500]   version two version three.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.500]   The thing I like most about i.o. Google i.o. though is as an
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   Apple user it's a great show for me because they make so many
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.500]   apps so many services for iOS that it's like it's a second
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.500]   Christmas I get to sit there and see all the awesome stuff they
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   do with photography what they're going to do with Gmail what
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.500]   they're going to do with Google now because I can enjoy that as
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   well and it's one of the best things about using an iPhone
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   you know you don't always get you don't even get great Google
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   services on the Amazon phone but you get them on the iPhone you
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   get great Apple services great Microsoft services is really
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500]   you know we get we get a lot of choice.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   Yeah and the other great thing about Google is that they are
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.500]   a company that's not afraid to put out their put out their best
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   ideas while they're developing them so Google I.O. is often
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   exciting because you're seeing something that the first
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   company is going to be investing in a new interface in a new type
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   of service even in a new type of hardware and you better
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   believe that everybody is going to be paying attention to that
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   because a year from now two years from now another five years
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   from now it could be relevant as opposed to just an interesting
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   demo and the other thing is that they keep improving all
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.500]   their core products I mean if they were to be able to.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   I'm interested to see if they have any sort of response to
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   iOS 8 because there's so many new opportunities that are
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.500]   presented if you if they have the ability to not to reframe
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   Google services as not only things that you have to hit a web
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   browser or custom app to do but something they could project
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   inside and throughout the entire Apple experience.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   Yikes that could be interesting if they if they find a way to
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   project Google now into iOS so that it becomes as something
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.500]   close to as integral to the experience as it is on an
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   Android phone.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   I think that Google now is going to pick up a lot of fans in iOS.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   Google will probably tomorrow show off some watches you know
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.500]   they've had this Android Wear platform designed for wearables
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.500]   not just Google Glass but watches too and it seems pretty
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.500]   strong rumor that LG and or Motorola or both will announce
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.500]   and show watches there.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   It's not the it's not the first time we've seen watches we've
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.500]   seen a lot of watches I'm wearing a gear two.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   None of these watches have been very impressive and Apple still
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   has not announced a watch but everybody in the world is telling
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.500]   me Apple will do a watch.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500]   October Leo is that it?
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500]   Are we going to see it in October is that pretty sure now?
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.500]   Two and a half inch screen.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   And I suspect it'll be like you know whatever it is I suspect
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.500]   that it will be the thing that hits reset on this market.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.500]   I mean it has in the Apple's been able to do that in past it with
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.500]   tablets that it with the iPod and then everybody sees it and goes
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500]   right let's let's do that.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.500]   Let's they they got it.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   It's not a given.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   It's not a given.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   You can do that.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   I'm not sure because I think that a watch is now such an
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.500]   idiosyncratic market at this stage.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   It's it's completely in flux.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   It's not like when they came up with the iPhone and all they had
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   to do excuse me now that it was a simple thing to build the iPhone
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   but they had several examples of commercially successful phones
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   to draw on as they come up with their own idea of how to do it.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   Tablets pretty much the same thing iPad was revolutionary but
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.500]   it was not necessarily first as not as though hyper mobile
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.500]   computing had been unseen before right now the idea of a wearable
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.500]   wearable device on your wrist is still something that nobody has
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.500]   demonstrated that they actually want nobody has built one of these
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   things that has been successful we've had things like the pebble
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   steel that shows that if you believe in this concept there's
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   some good hardware out there and it can be made very very
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   practical so I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not dismissing the
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   idea that Apple's going to come out with something with a color
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   touch screen or even that I'm not even dismissing that it's going
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   to be a huge monster hit I'm just saying that I'm just not a
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   position right now where I feel I can predict anything I'll still
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   I will say that I'll still be surprised if it looks like a
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   convent like what we imagine a smart watch is going to look
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.500]   like because I still can't get my head around the idea of Apple
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   designing something that will fit both a man's wrist and a woman's
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   wrist and I don't imagine that they'd be happy and doing something
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   that they feel will only appear will only be a purchaseable by
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   49% of the market but again I'll go back to my buzzword I don't
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   know yeah I think it's a halegas to the more analogous to the
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.500]   iPod than the iPhone this is this is a market where there isn't
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   much out there that isn't super nerdy and geeky that regular
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   people are using which was sort of like the mp3 player market back
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.500]   then and there was some stuff out there but it wasn't super
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   impressive and nobody was saying oh there's a big thing here and
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   that's that that's a much harder trick to pull off I think it was
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   pretty clear with mp3 players starting with a diamond Rio and
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   Samsung and a bunch of other companies had him the nomad that
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.500]   there was something there was sure that was something we wanted
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   and I don't know if you can quantify it that way yet the tablets
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.500]   it was something we wanted we wanted tablets but you and with
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.500]   it I mean up blackberry was my smartphone before the iPhone
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   the e71 from Nokia it was clear these were categories that
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   were begging to be burst I don't think I don't think the iPhone
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   was preceded by the blackberry and the iPod was preceded by the
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   Sony disc man yeah so it's not I don't believe they really
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   busted a brand new market that is made this thing they didn't
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   in tablets I that's my point is that their markets existed just
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   as they do in the eye watch and though in the smartwatch market
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   but I think the difference is in those early markets they're really
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   you could see this is going to happen I have a question of
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   getting it right and I don't see that with these at all I thought
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   I've had it explained to me that you know with the phone and
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500]   with the tablet Apple could clearly see what sucked about those
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   things and I had very clear ideas about what they could do to
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   improve them because there was years if not decade of devices on
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.500]   the market before that and watches smartwatches are just not
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   that old there hasn't been enough time for products to mature to
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   the point where Apple absolutely knows what sucks and what they
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.500]   can do so I think it is more analogous to a device where Apple
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.500]   is coming earlier on the market maybe Apple TV kind of early on
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   the market and it's also not a huge market no one has told you
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   million smartphones yet so it entirely is a different thing
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   than when they put up the iPhone and that's a really important
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   point the most optimistic projections for an eye watch
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   market if you calculated out would be a tiny fraction of what
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   the smartphone market is for what the iPhone market is but it's
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   it's well the room okay let me give you the room around as we
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   should have a little guy a little CNN style graphic the eye watch
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   rumor round this music the latest from Reuters saying Taiwan's
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.500]   quanta computer incorporated another one of them Chinese
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.500]   manufacturing people will start mass production of apples first
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   smartwatch next month remember to I mean also is that like
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500]   thing remember one thing the watch will likely measure two
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   and a half inches diagonally ding is I don't know what this
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   means slightly rectangular is that rounded yeah that made me laugh
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   just off from square yeah the the source by the way one source
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.500]   does not a summer make added that the watch face will protrude
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   slightly from the band creating an arch shape sounds like
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   supply chain leakage terrible idea does not like supply chain
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   linkage and that could be painful and will feature a touch
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   interface and wireless charging capabilities and we've heard
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.500]   this before apple expected to ship 50 million units that's
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   probably based on the amount the order size and that the
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   display from an this is another source will come from LG
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   exclusive supplier of the screen by the way LG making a watch
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   which we expect to see tomorrow Google I/O and another person
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   familiar with the matter and and another source say October
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   will be the release date and come on chat you can help me out
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   here we got five that's five new a date oh he just turned off
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   the tricaster crash the tricaster is that what happened there
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.500]   don't hurt apparently I tried to do a transition that was too much
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:51.500]   to tell Leo that's what happens now I have to say the one I'm in
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   I've tried every galaxy gear watch the gear fit the gear to
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.500]   the gear one I've tried to the I gave the pebble away to Chad
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.500]   who likes it yeah I used to wearing yours okay that's because
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.500]   these are the guys who used to wear nano watches I thought nano
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   watch it no never know that was a terrible I've tried every band
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   out there oh you got your pebble there mr. Renee watch that's
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.500]   what the nano watch I don't know that one oh that's the nano the
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   iPad nano in the pebble so there's the difference in size right
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.000]   there I'd rather have a big screen frankly the pebble shows you
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.620]   the time when all went just when you look at it the nano you
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.260]   got to like press a button to see what the time is every time
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.760]   I turn it on and it's and it's got a watch face which is kind of
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.900]   nice I just didn't want to be left out what the hell is that
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.900]   is that a Casio that's my on hand wrist PC that runs palm OS
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.340]   okay there you go there's a big cause I have a I have a galaxy
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.840]   gear two and a pebble but they're both upstairs in my nightstand
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.340]   charging so I just didn't want to feel that and I've tried the
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.100]   fuel band that fit bit the Nike that I mean the jaw bone up
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.100]   yeah so look at what this has been a crowded space all of which
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   have flopped now I have to say I'm looking at Motorola's
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.300]   official teaser for the Moto 360 and the one thing I find
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   interesting about this and I do will be give us one Google
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.500]   mass I say us and I'm not gonna be there but he's is round it's
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.740]   got a round screen I've heard a lot of people really angry about
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.940]   this teaser in the industry because a lot of people believe
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   that there is no technology that is a lie to make a watch it's
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.900]   a lot to have a watch that big they can do that much that is on
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.620]   for any length of time just seems beyond the constraints of
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.140]   technology said this video is not only setting up Motorola
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.780]   for disappointment but it's going to create false expectations
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.460]   and a lot of people for what a watch could do is it disinformation
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.380]   is Motorola trying to screw with Apple on this it's still
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.660]   frames I mean this is not real obviously although there is a
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.020]   video there's a Google video showing Android where in which
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.540]   somebody is talking to what looks like a Moto 360 yeah it is
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.900]   off the stick look at this at this point they're trying to
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.100]   sell at this point they're trying to sell platform not
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.140]   hardware and that's really the difference and Google actually
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.780]   has demonstrated that with Google now with and with their
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.220]   card design they've got a lot of they've got a lot of stuff
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.060]   that's already in play that if you can really instantly see it
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.540]   transverse transferred on to a not a round watch face but if they
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.340]   could make a squared panel kind of like kind of like the the
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.220]   pebble even if a little bit bigger and if all it did was
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.940]   display Google now cards and if it had simply a microphone so
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.540]   that you could Dick Tracy style give it commands and get
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.420]   information back to back from it that would be a pretty cool
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.380]   product it might even be a product that would be worth
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.060]   200 to 250 dollars so it's less of a mystery I think with
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.340]   with Google's mobile mobility ideas than the apples right
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.140]   this is the gear to I'm going to review on before you buy later
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.540]   in the day but it had it this is the refined the second
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.820]   very variation from Samsung cameras now built in instead
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.860]   of being a little pimple on the band I can give the camera
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.740]   voice commands in fact some of the I'll show images from the
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.980]   zip lining thing I did just I did it just so I could try this
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.820]   one and you can say record video you could say take a photo
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.860]   and it will do it much easier to stock women on ski slopes without
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.780]   looking to creep it's actually good on a zip line because
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:11.340]   you're going like this yeah and then you know it has fitness app
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.540]   it has apps itself it has a UI it's kind of like an iPod
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.540]   nano in the UI this is ties and this is not Motorola's I mean
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.340]   that Google's Android where and okay given all of that all the
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.020]   functionality you could ever want you could talk to it it could
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.420]   talk to you it does health every it's still a non starter and
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.340]   it's 300 bucks and it feels to me like a non starter who is
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.340]   going to buy these I think is the big question and the big the
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.060]   biggest question is is anybody who doesn't strap something on
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.980]   their wrist every day today going to start because these
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.580]   things will be so compelling that they want to do it and if
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.700]   the answer is no it's never going to be a big market or it's
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.820]   going to be a big market for the over somebody in the chat
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.260]   room saying something over 50 crowd over 40 crowd where wrist
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.820]   watches people who wear wrist watches think think about the
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.580]   thing about the reason why people stop wearing wristwatches
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.980]   because they shunted all of those that functionality onto
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.020]   their phone so if you stop trying to sell them a watch that
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.180]   has digital features and you start trying to sell them well
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.980]   here's a smaller version of your phone and it's wearable
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.740]   that's a way in yeah and for me from before right pocket watches
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.620]   got displaced by wristwatches because they were more convenient
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.900]   it could happen again but it is I safe to be scared I would I'm
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.860]   going to extend this now because I think it's all wearables I
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.820]   think we haven't solved the wearable conundrum and I don't
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.380]   know if Apple is going to be able to solve it I think this is
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.100]   this is understandable for it companies need to think of what
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.820]   the next big thing is they can't sit on their rest on their
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.460]   laurels when you look about at like what Apple's doing with
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.100]   health book or health sorry it's not health book marker
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.100]   mental kill me he's like I can't help German it was not
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.940]   with the help health health apps and apis in iOS 8 I think
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.620]   what we're we're seeing is a hint that which I think is
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.220]   smart and Google's doing this too that this is not a the
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.980]   wearables thing is not a one product thing it is it is the
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.180]   that's why I really think I'll say why I say wearables because
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.140]   it may be something on your shoe or in your shoe and something on
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.820]   your belt and something on your wrist and something in your
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.940]   on your glasses or in your smart hat just throwing it out which
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.100]   Jason has always been a part of the get on it and and that they'll
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.660]   all work together and then what you'll be doing is based on
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.540]   maybe your personal style love it is integrated into your clothes
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.420]   if Apple in October says it's not a watch it's a hat Angela
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.180]   Aaron says it's Burberry Platt it's a hat we're going to make men
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.940]   wear hats again yeah why not there's a piece of
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.820]   clothing that everybody wears all the time you know you can't make
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.860]   one thing to suit everything that's my android wear makes sense
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.500]   because it's not Google's not saying we're going to make a
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.380]   watch platform is there where we can wearable platform we started
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.020]   with glass but it could be a watch they're going to show watches
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.860]   um I don't I don't know if the advantage of the watch see
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.900]   that you can see not making a watch what are they making I
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.340]   also wearable wearable so they you think they'll focus on wearable
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.460]   well I mean the idea is that I right previously the wearable stuff that
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.340]   Apple made were iPods that ran I forget what's called Pika whatever it
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.100]   was OS and those were not connected to iCloud they were not
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.220]   connected to anything else that Apple made they were still tethered they are
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.020]   still to this day tethered to iTunes over a USB cable
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.100]   and Apple needs to get iOS on to things as small as I as iPod because that's
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.500]   what that's going to make I just think that if I
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.820]   if I were if I were gonna make any wagers I'm still more focused on them I
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.780]   they're making more something more like a health ban than a watch
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.420]   and one of the when one of the difficulties I have is
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.420]   how much money is somebody willing to put on their wrist on something that's
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.860]   unproven I mean I almost I almost think that the one the
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.060]   most successful products Apple could make in the space
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:46.060]   is if the first thing they put on that whiteboard is $99 think I don't care
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.140]   what you do but it cannot cost one penny more than $99 and we'll make it as
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.260]   good as we can possibly make it we'll make it as useful as we possibly make it
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.460]   and we will also remember that this is not the only one of things we will ever
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.780]   make but we want the first one we make to be
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.540]   $99 people can get them jobs did that with a Mac and of course it didn't come
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.940]   in at the price that he said it should come in that
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.340]   they've usually gone high and then brought it down over time
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.060]   see for me the reason you put something on your wrist is because it's
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.180]   glanceable and the reason that I still have the pebble and use it is because
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.860]   I like push notifications coming to my wrist where I can see whether I want to
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.340]   get the phone out and interact or if I just want to glance and see what's
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.460]   going on and then go back to what I'm doing and if you look at what Apple
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.300]   announced with iOS 8 with these these today
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.140]   view widgets that developers can write the idea that you could have a
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.100]   glanceable thing sitting on your wrist that could tell you what's going on in
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.020]   the world what your favorite sports score is right now
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.380]   what that push notification is a quick response saying I'll be right there but
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.340]   nothing in great detail just some basic sort of
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.740]   glancing and tapping that might be a thing but that's you know that's why
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.060]   you park something on somebody's wrist is because
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.740]   your arms are flailing around and you can and you can quick
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.300]   quick type it will be very poor nail Jerry poor nail nail this on Sunday
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.860]   and I want to know what you guys think that he in 10 years
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.100]   we this will all come to fruition it will be a subcutaneous wrist
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.340]   tattoo roughly the size of an iPhone that'll glow through your skin
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.660]   you'll be able to see how much time you have left on this earth
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:20.060]   it'll yeah that says familiar is there a built-in blast Logan's run
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.780]   and I think that's what I want I don't want a big honking
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.660]   things I don't want I don't want surgery for my
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.500]   technology that's all that's that's that's that's that's that's
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.380]   that's surgery they can tattoo it it's a nano it's a nano
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.180]   vertical but I mean I agree completely with what
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.980]   Jason's talking about because I know one of the I've been trying to get in as
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.860]   many smart wearables as I possibly can and one of the
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.700]   actually one of the most interesting things that I've gotten in is this
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.180]   Cassio watch that doesn't cost a whole lot of money
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.020]   and doesn't do a whole lot the only the big selling point is it does have a
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.500]   a matrix display in the corner of the watch that can receive notifications
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   from from the phone but for all that it is relatively
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.100]   affordable it is a g g shock style watch so I'm not
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.900]   gonna worry about it getting wet I'm not gonna worry about it getting
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.420]   about dropping dropping on the floor and it does deliver the one thing that would
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.020]   get me to really really want to buy money and have this on my wrist every
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.260]   single day and it will also be a low power device
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.420]   I mean there's so many difficulties with the 250 dollar 300 dollar color
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.420]   multi-touch display on the wrist including you won't be able to see it but
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.340]   there's there's there's scratches on every watch that I own as always
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.340]   right about here that's because I am exactly average height for an American
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.700]   male and because god hates average height American males
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.300]   all metal doorknobs are exactly the same height as the watch face
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.100]   and at least once a month I'll just be here click like god damn it
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.020]   long and I've and I've just done that and and the first time that I've I'm sure
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.860]   that within the first month of having this watch I'm gonna like be saying oh
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.980]   damn at least three times wondering if I'd finally broke this damn thing
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.660]   so I'm wondering if apple is capable of doing something
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.220]   smart but simple and if pebble is actually a company that is more that is
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.500]   better poised to do great things because all they want to do is
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.380]   sell a lot of watches as opposed to conquer the market or define a space or
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.820]   prove that they're better than they're as good as the previous CEO
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.180]   was here's how much time you have left Andy
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:23.500]   I I think until we come up with a form factor that is comfortable
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.340]   flexible I just don't think we're there I think we're so far off we're not
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.020]   even the magical mysterious Johnny I've the wizard of I've I don't think he's
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:38.220]   gonna be the first apple wearable is gonna be even if it sells okay
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:43.260]   is it's not gonna be the ultimate end right I mean
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.940]   and the first iPhone the first iPod would be silly to write off the category
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.060]   because the first one is too big and unwieldy and thick because it will be
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   bigger and thicker than people wanted to be speaking of mark german he says
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.380]   Kobe Bryant's wearing whatever it is he says apple has enlisted
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.220]   pro athletes to test the fitness capabilities of whatever this
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.220]   thing or a fake whatever it is that's wrapped in yeah I don't think that's it
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.340]   obviously uh apple and apple collide it's mark stream
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.340]   they say the king's right winger dusted brown
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.180]   uh a player from the red socks also on the project of course their
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:21.980]   ndade bryant was spotted at the apple campus last month meaning with john
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:27.580]   eiv that's true hard to miss kobe bryant he's like 18 feet
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.460]   tall so you know it's interesting well it's it's interesting remember how
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.580]   beats headphones got banned from the world cup because if you want to make a
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.940]   popular brand you give freebies to high priced athletes that are going to be
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.100]   on television for two weeks they were banned
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.380]   yeah uh the way wouldn't necessarily ban it's just that their sony is a is the

[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.460]   fire i think there's a couple of interesting things in amazon's phone it's
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.140]   really a me too phone spec wise but they've put in some features the made a
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.940]   feature i think is a great idea they've done very well with the fire
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.580]   kind of fire HD and HDX you press a button within 15 seconds of
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.540]   rep answers and can help you could actually control the screen
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.660]   now admittedly anybody who's ever used a smartphone probably won't use that but
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.860]   it might be a great come on for people who've never used a smartphone before
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.060]   they're not the ones buying an amazon phone well that's what's interesting i
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.580]   don't know people like me on price to one yeah maybe you're i mean it really
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.820]   is aimed at the iPhone in the high-end androids this is my question and i've
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.860]   talked to a bunch of industry analysts and everyone's answer is similar but
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.620]   still is still confusing to me is that you know i know why apple made a phone i
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.140]   have i know why google made a phone i have no idea why amazon short term made
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.740]   this phone because it's not there's no customer reason at least i understand
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.580]   amazon might want a window like this might be the new display window for
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.780]   stores this might be a way for them to get even more money out of the whales
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.780]   that support the prime system but there's there's nothing in this phone that i
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.700]   think is is there is no way i would ever recommend this phone to anybody and
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.540]   i've struggled for the last week to figure out an answer to that the firefly
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.820]   button is completely self-serving made is a feature that sounds great but
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.380]   probably doesn't apply to the people who actually would seek out and use this
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.140]   phone it just it seems it seems like a hot mess to me and i'm really
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.580]   disappointed because i think amazon it's one of the few companies you know maybe
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.500]   facebook who hasn't made a phone yet who could have done something like a palm
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.380]   pre or like an android well i i compare the first version of
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.460]   this phone to the first version of the kindle fire where the fireheads had a
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.740]   lot of potential but it wasn't something you recommend to people and then just
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.580]   two generations later i do think that it's completely competitive with the
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.940]   ipad and this doesn't do everything the ipad does but it does a lot of things
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.220]   better than the ipad if that's the sort of stuff you're using with
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.820]   and i do see i like the choices that they made in this thing
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.740]   uh firefly isn't necessarily completely self-serving because you can be
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.580]   in best buy trying to choose between two coffee pots determined to buy that
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.940]   coffee pot right then and there and now you can simply press a button and get
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.740]   access to all the amazon reviews of those devices
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.620]   it's extensible by developers so the idea of having a button on the phone that is
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.060]   always your one click answer to the question of i want more information about
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.740]   this one thing i'm looking at be it a state flag be it a
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.780]   a phone number be it a piece of art be it anything
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.340]   that's interesting the idea that they're integrating gesture controls into just
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.300]   the core level of the of the operating system and the interface
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.180]   that's interesting too because i've always thought that
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.140]   it's not like it's not that i'm wearing up my thumb scrolling
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.500]   things down or or tapping it's something to get more information about
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.300]   something but if they were universal gesture and
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.740]   every that worked in almost every app that said scroll down scroll down or
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.700]   get me more information but what i'm looking at i'd certainly use it
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.860]   and the final thing is i love the idea of having
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:13.100]   3d cameras on a mobile device and allowing developers to play with that i
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.660]   mean just like the there are a million flashlight apps that came out as soon
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.860]   as you had a phone that had a big powerful led on it i think there's going to be a
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.260]   million different 3d capture apps for this for this phone when it comes out
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.980]   and when you start thinking about how the presence of a good camera on you at
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.860]   all times change the way we think about photography
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.340]   potentially that could be a big change in how we think about 3d capture and how
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.860]   we read the world around us i agree with ryan that i'm not sure that i would
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.100]   recommend the fire phone to anybody in 2014 but i'm going to be definitely
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.580]   taking a look at it in 2015 and by 2016 if developers support all these unique
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.420]   features they put into the hardware it could be something pretty cool
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:59.420]   i don't know i i love amazon i'm a prime subscriber i you know i i really like my
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.740]   sort of apple stuff and my amazon stuff working together i i prefer to use
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.220]   amazon's uh you know read amazon's books and stuff like that but also
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.500]   fight you know i like i like to yeah i hate it
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.860]   i have to say i am not super impressed with amazon's
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.620]   software user interface stuff their little carousels and things like that i'm
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.220]   skeptical about the phone being kind of a ui mess i i
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.100]   josh depulsky from the verged tweeted during the event
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.660]   this is a hot mess of a of an interface and from all the images i've seen
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.620]   i would agree with that so i'm i'm skeptical but you're right the first
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.980]   kindle was terrible the first kindle fire was not very good
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.100]   and they got it right over time and maybe they'll do the same here
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.700]   so i think it's interesting but it seems much less compelling to ryanne's point
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.740]   a device then the kindle fire was as a tablet because this is i don't know do i
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.020]   need a phone from amazon and amazon's gonna be on my phone
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.900]   anyway so i don't know i'm i'm skeptical i do like that it gives you a year prime
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.100]   for free because that actually does the people who are going to buy this phone
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.820]   that actually has value to them that's a hundred bucks that is a hundred
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.820]   dollars discount yeah but the thing is like if you read the fine
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.460]   print it says for example if you take that phone out of the us you no
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.620]   longer get amazon video the the that phone is non-starter outside the
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.900]   u.s and even the kindle fire three which is better than the two which is better
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.740]   than the one it doesn't sell i mean that thing fell off a cliff
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.580]   it's gonna be very very as we won't be saying amazon advertising it at the
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.580]   world cup let's put it that way yes
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.820]   certainly and by the way fire tv fire tv very similar we don't know amazon's a
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.620]   black box in terms of sales figures so we don't know but
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.500]   and i think i think fire tv i think the phone these are all kind of
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.020]   uh incremental products and that actually raises a question dallas in our
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.740]   chat room said going back to the i-watch
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.740]   is it uh how important of a product is it for apple is it a maker break product
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.740]   no it's a hobby the iphone is the maker break product it's a hobby
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.860]   so relatively though it's important well it's it's going to get a lot of
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.700]   attention it's going to be an important product no matter what they do it
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.740]   that's simply by virtue the fact that apple is entering this market however
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.100]   yes we can't ignore the fact that apple even they're not they're not as
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.820]   as consistent as amazon in the terms of making one thing that's not very good
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.500]   but then improving as they go but we tend to forget that things are
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.180]   things rarely sprout out of apple's forehead fully formed
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.180]   uh the macbook air needed time the i the iphone needed time
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.780]   the ipad needed a little bit of time uh i think that's i think it's going to be
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.980]   hot to begin with and people who are early believers are going to be very very
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.740]   happy with whatever apple makes but it's going to take a couple years for it to
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.700]   really get to where and almost anybody would say that they have really defined
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.820]   a category with it at least that's what i thought what i meant was the media like
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.460]   apple already the i-watch is not even out and they're saying apple's playing
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.420]   ketchup with sam song and other companies which is a daft statement it's what
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.260]   they're gonna yeah it's what they're gonna be held to
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.500]   regardless the markets and the media they they they got enough money that's not
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.660]   they're not led they're not like hp where if they get bad press tailing off an
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.180]   early release they got it back off it right away or else the world's people get
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.100]   fired uh i think i i think that we need to come up with a new way of
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.460]   dismissing people who are saying silly things that nonetheless they believe
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.260]   in because they will be proven out in time and we may
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.300]   take their keyboards away Andy you just take their keyboards away
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.460]   yeah i wish we had here's another thing Chad we should add
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.180]   a mothership cam i think we just need to find a cam somewhere in kupertino
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.500]   that just can watch the construction of the mothership
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.540]   i feel i feel i feel as though this is one part of the earth that is not going
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.900]   to go oh that that's not that's not going to be hurting for
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.740]   timelax pictures of the project i think that i think that there are people who
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.020]   are just basically creating solar drones that
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.700]   could stay hovering in one place so that their site can have
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.980]   the the the the time lapse when angling no one else has
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.780]   i'm really because they've broken ground and they're
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.860]   pursuing ground area now see and now it looks like a really cool rally cross
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.580]   ring yes well there are no cars right there
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.780]   there has there have to have been somebody at apple that said
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.620]   i know that i just have to have you tell me no i have to ask
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.380]   can we have one day when no one's there and we'll just do one day of rally
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.100]   cross so we can say we did it yeah we uh we did that in our basement before we

[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.700]   oh yeah all baby the cheap twenty one technically
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.220]   uh twenty one and a half inch iMac actually really it's a new price although
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.860]   there's some things you should know about for instance yeah
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.820]   you can't them a memory is soldered on this thousand ninety nine dollar iMac
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:00.700]   it's dual course i5 uh it's got an hd 5 000
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.500]   graphics that's the intel graphics built in graphics yeah
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   and a hard drive not even a fusion drive not a speedy drive just a regular spinning
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.740]   500 gig hard drive but the big one is un-upgradable memory the memory what
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.380]   you see is what you get
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.860]   uh... but it's affordable in fact best by i think is offering it
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.140]   uh...
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.900]   with the uh... student discount educational discount for down below
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.940]   nine hundred bucks
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.620]   eight fifty i think so
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.380]   here's the thing we mackerel uh... tested this and uh...
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:36.220]   uh... gave it uh... a really middling review uh... and it's a middling performer
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.700]   the key question in the review from jim gallbraith is
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.500]   is a fifteen percent lower price
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.540]   worth fifty percent lower performance that much lower
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.860]   slow
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.740]   and and honestly you might be better off if you if you're budget is tight enough
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.220]   that you can't go up that extra two hundred dollars
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.340]   you might want to look for a refurb
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:59.260]   uh... oven or an older model that you can buy used because they will be
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.140]   faster than this super slow
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.300]   mac that seems to be destined for education but it's like a bad deal i mean
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.480]   unless you literally
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.420]   what do you need the speed though i mean is in that fast enough
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.060]   well it
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.720]   i think it's the same street i like it with this argument on twitter and i have a
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.060]   lot of people yell at me because not everybody needs four course right now
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.500]   everybody needs that the storage is slow i wish it was a is it a fifty five
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.580]   r_p_m_ drive is a slower drive it's a minute really we're really well put in
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.460]   drive it doesn't have any ssd on it i think today
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.580]   lots of people could use this and it would be fine i think the concern would be
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.780]   that it's not an age as well as that system that's twice that's twice as fast
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.220]   for
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.980]   remember it's designed to compete against four and five hundred dollar p_c_s_
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.660]   sure that are equally slower slower but it's ten ninety nine it's not like it's
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:46.060]   nine ninety nine or eight ninety nine it's ten ninety nine it's just it's a
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.580]   bigger performance gap for price
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.180]   then we've seen from apple right for quite a while and not by a bearable and
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.940]   not up and then it's all right it's basically a macbook air inside there
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.740]   yeah except with a uh... spinning hard drive instead of the speed ssd
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.620]   and frankly for education i think that well maybe they don't they want
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.380]   desktops like a lot of the kids leo
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.740]   yeah i can see sir
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.780]   i don't think the kids can tell
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.980]   really give you my time to tell
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.980]   when i when i saw the performance but i would make me really wonder is if
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.580]   they're really trying to make a budget
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.380]   mac for education why not target the mac mini
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.940]   uh... or does this indicate that maybe when we see the next rev of mac mini we
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.700]   will see uh... four hundred ninety nine dollar mac many
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:33.780]   because if you if you really want to get it to get more max on more desktops
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.500]   they probably already have a monitor out there or the probably willing to
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.940]   settle for a cheap two hundred fifty dollar del monitor or they probably got
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.780]   keyboards they probably got everything they need except for that which makes
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.620]   them uh... mac makes a max
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.980]   i was a little bit i was a little bit confused by that i i read the release
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.700]   i read the specs i thought this doesn't seem like a very interesting computer
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.740]   but i bet that once people start reviewing it tearing it down all c_o_o_
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:00.740]   no it really isn't very good so i was a good yes schools like i max because
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.660]   they are all in one and that's good and and uh... mac mini with a monitor
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.140]   you got people pulling the plug and and it's a point and it's schools really like
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.420]   i'm actually like laptops to
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.340]   uh... but it is for the students for one-to-one program but i think that
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.420]   they're allowed but in a lab it's i max my daughter's school is absolutely
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.460]   it's all i max
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.020]   that actually makes sense and i i i i think it's appropriate to do the caveat
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.100]   to say look understand what you're getting
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.820]   for this price uh... but i think that this
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.860]   we are tech is right and so we're not the
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.980]   market for it
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.940]   and i think that this is the right device for a lot of
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.700]   people including schools but
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.220]   but if i if i were advising somebody who
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:42.900]   had a very tight budget and one of the fine i mac i would say
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.500]   i would say look at the refurbished i max because they're for the same price you
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.300]   can get the higher you can get something that's twice as fast which you
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.460]   can only get one and the school needs to buy twenty school can't do that yeah
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.060]   right we know if education pricing is even cheaper on this is a box cheaper i
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.780]   think
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.700]   it's not a lot cheaper but it is cheaper
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.420]   well i saw best by press let me just see
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:06.340]   but this is the education i'm at two this is this is where this is doing the
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.460]   i'm at
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.500]   yeah it's like the old e_m_a_i_i_ i'm at
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.540]   so yeah this is the great conundrum is you know two hundred dollars gets you a
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.420]   much better system but what if that two hundred dollars is money for speed you
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.340]   don't need
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:22.140]   uh... it probably expands the life span to have a faster system right this will
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.820]   be able to run
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.540]   crap this will be crappier in three years then the the one that's two hundred
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.580]   dollars more faster than a Chromebook it's faster than a raspberry pie it's
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.100]   faster than a run always can be served as the question
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.660]   after the water faster than one of the t_i_ ninety nine
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.980]   faster than
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.060]   i don't know
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.100]   but yeah you buy you buy six to get one for free so that's a feature to that
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.140]   would be good
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.420]   let's do that
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.500]   so another rumor more rumors on the iphone i think i think at this point
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.660]   can we lock it down there will be two iphones
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.620]   probably september
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.980]   four point seven inch display on one
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.820]   since five point five inch on another
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.660]   you don't see is that we're really going to do a five-and-a-half inch iphone
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.900]   you know that's a departure
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.180]   that's a new album
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.220]   so new and it is you know
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.900]   i mean that you start you talk about not just the
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   sources of rumors but the velocity of them in the directions they come from
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:20.180]   and although i would not have predicted even four months ago that apple would
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:20.540]   have
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.260]   slagum gone with two different larger screen iphones now
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.140]   i'm really starting to believe that there's going to be you
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.060]   there's going to be a normal-sized phone that's large that on iphone and
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.660]   but all and also one that's kind of like a pop tart
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.060]   i would never guess that that is that is the ones that is the ones
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.820]   indication of the kind of like a pop the
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.420]   on the pop tart is that's the only way to put it and the great thing is like it
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.460]   means that i think you have to go down to the i've got on the store buy some
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.620]   chocolate pop tarts make the comparison
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.060]   it doesn't taste as good i'm
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.500]   willing with it is the first thing i noticed with the nokia fifteen twenty
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.900]   doesn't look very very familiar so i bought a box of pop tarts it is exactly
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:01.260]   the size of one and one half pop tarts you put one and one half pop tarts on
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.260]   top of it you completely cover the foots you've blown the ratio that can't be
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.180]   you can't you can't that's a long pop tart nobody wants that just do you have
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.100]   an iphone on you
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.140]   i do doesn't want more so let's do the comparison because i think this is
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.340]   not exactly an exact comparison because
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.740]   here's the this is an iphone five s you have the over the shoulder
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.420]   that's the four inch screen
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.700]   this is a uh... a uh... a a a a h_t_c_ m_h_ that's a five inch screen so it's
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.060]   bigger than
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.820]   the four point seven will be i don't have my uh... moto at the middle it's in
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:35.420]   the middle and this is a c_n_o_ three is five point seven inches this is fairly
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.140]   close to what an iphone
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.780]   uh... mite uh... six might look like as a jump of that
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.260]   jump of the job
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.860]   like a big question from
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.220]   for me there is that
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.340]   the note size of the phablets have not sold in north american any
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.380]   appreciable number they've sold like gangbusters in asia but
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.460]   they sold for at a rather low price point and i don't think apple's gonna do
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.540]   low give me that again cuz then this is a pop tart
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.340]   uh...
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.420]   and
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.620]   now wait a minute pop tart work there if you've got pop tart you have
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.740]   the top tarts
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.060]   on door by three though are you saying it'll be a
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.380]   no it'll be sixteen nine one of us
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.380]   i don't know if you had to pop tarts together with that be the
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:18.380]   six-inch that the i've had many that's that's the idea i've had many
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.940]   and here's an air
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.100]   so there
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.340]   all darn well i guess i'm gonna have to eat that one
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.780]   the years more certainly can you like a pop tart sure yeah
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.100]   won't get over
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.780]   yet we do have pop tart just part of the employee benefit program offer
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.100]   they have to have a lot of the
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.660]   not coming through
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.140]   what i can't hear you i've got a pop tart in my
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.660]   holding it upside down you're holding it wrong but it's working
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.700]   that's not a kind of problem on the pop tart
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:51.140]   i don't kind of flavor pop tart is this is that sparkles on a strawberry
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.060]   you need a bumper of icing before you get calls on that
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.860]   icing bumper they make uh... they may but the way okay this is not a helpful
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.780]   snack
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:02.700]   no i've seen the calories and that things is not a helpful practice as many
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.580]   calories like a big mac one of them for lunch
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.940]   make sure you know that in your health happily out
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.540]   i'm not even
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.020]   we just got the pop tart t_v_ desk
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.180]   everybody gets pop tart
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.900]   jason push one towards the t_v_ push one towards the t_v_
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.020]   who buys pop tarts for the staff that's right
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.700]   is that is that debbie is that uh... lisa's idea debbie
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.180]   i think we bought them like six months ago and they've just been
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.300]   and i have a well that's a good thing about a pop tart they keep for a long
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.980]   after ever
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.660]   yeah uh... anti theft technology
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.580]   built into phones in new york basically this you know
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.060]   kill switch
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:46.740]   uh... has uh... reduced theft fifteen at what is it five fifteen percent
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.580]   no even more yeah in the in the san francisco
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.340]   i-phone robberies dropped thirty eight percent after the apple put the uh...
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.940]   the lock feature in active in london
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.260]   they felt twenty four percent
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.620]   new york city
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.700]   robberies which are you know like
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:08.140]   gimme your you know the threat of violence nineteen percent grand larcenese
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.860]   drop twenty nine percent
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.060]   and the same sumpf's went up
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.540]   uh...
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.860]   and they're easier to see well as the word the word that is a m some products
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.620]   increased fifty one percent at that same time
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.100]   so this i'm going for the person to write the article showing that apple is
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.060]   doomed because it's that's a down in samsa
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.500]   that's a lot of the more popular
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.500]   uh... that's the kill switch he's a learned that they can't they can't sell
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.280]   stolen i funds anymore because of the lock i would have a lot i'm actually
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.940]   surprised because i usually think the thieves are pretty stupid
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.060]   and that they would be very slow to gather this but i guess they would be
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.960]   found out they stole a few and they said
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.340]   oh wait a minute these are these are the
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.900]   you want to be one by an i-phone well right samsa by those
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.780]   so i'm so so if there were any doubt the kill switches something totally works
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.820]   it works
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.340]   yep
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.380]   uh...
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.860]   now whether the government should mandated is another question i think
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.040]   probably we did it just an evidence that
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.540]   samsa should get on the bandwagon fact they are
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.140]   they are talking about it
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.760]   and uh... and i think the wireless carriers probably should do something
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.280]   about the this copy that the idea though
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.960]   that the wireless carriers don't want to kill switch because
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.600]   they want people to buy more phones
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.680]   i hope that's not true that's that really imputes some sort of evil
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.240]   uh...
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.040]   morality in the in the in the head offices of a rising in t which i doubt
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.200]   exists
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.820]   incompetence to send it to a large degree is indistinguishable from
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.440]   allis leo maybe it's in confidence anyway
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.080]   the kill switch is good
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.740]   activation lot is good it works it works big time
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:40.640]   significantly
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.120]   as a factor both the google and microsoft have both said that they're gonna be
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:48.120]   adding kill switches to windows phone and rights is how it should be
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.400]   it just makes sense of it by far we all all of us here
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.700]   have probably that library of those questions that people ask us because
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.520]   they know there's a logical answer to this but they think they just don't know
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.280]   what it is
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.640]   and one of the one of the highlights of that listed for me is well obviously
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.320]   if i obviously if i just simply tell them with a serial number is
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.480]   uh... that is going to be impossible for anybody use that phone or the if
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.040]   everyone takes that to apple store or something they're gonna be able to
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.240]   instant no there is no way to do that right they do that they don't track
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.960]   serial numbers they have no way of returning your phone to you even if
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.480]   someone says hi found us on a park bench of this is the most logical place for
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.520]   me to return an apple store can you please return this to its owner can
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.720]   help you don't have an i-phone or if your iphone is older doesn't have
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.640]   activation lock by all means
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.520]   uh... install every single phone platform has a kill switch software you can
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.840]   install on it
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.160]   uh... looking at this and read phone and it says when you when it's that you
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.680]   have ten chances to unlock it after that i'm a race myself is that the same as
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.280]   activation lock no because that's just wiping the phone they'll do that anyway
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.760]   with a not with a still still still still right now that's right they can
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.340]   resell it the idea with the modern i_o_s_ devices
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.440]   you can wipe it you can do whatever you want it will need you to enter in an
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   apple id and a password that was great that was just on their before
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.640]   before it will unlock and otherwise it's just a brick
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.480]   i noticed by the way maybe they're doing this on uh... your semity because i
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.160]   noticed that i need to use an apple id to log into my Yosemite
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.600]   you need to but it's an option it's encouraged at microsoft does this with
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.040]   the windows eight
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.320]   uh... and that would have the same benefit yet i'm maybe not
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.280]   it depends i mean i think that it's not as long as to be tied
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.400]   to be probably just pull out the drive but
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.920]   on the i_o_s_ devices they can do it
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.480]   i think this is a great response could go on apple and nobody by the way has
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.960]   uh...
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.360]   nobody else has that activation lock feature that's unique to apple
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.080]   but it could be a lot of time yeah to that extent
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.960]   t-mobile will lend you a five s if you want to now rise into this a while ago
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.000]   they discontinued the program but the you can have uh...
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.400]   starting june twenty-third which was
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.800]   yesterday right
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.120]   you can uh... go to a t-mobile store and say i'd like to try an i-phone five
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.560]   s for a week
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.680]   you get john lager's personal life on is it is
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.040]   now they're having it around
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.360]   one of his acting it's
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360]   what do you think it's on ledger
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.960]   he's entertaining i don't know how good a c_o_s_ but boy is he like you have not
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.000]   seen john lageria on you've not seen Shakespeare the ways meant to be
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.040]   uh... you have to go to t-mobiles website to sign up
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.120]   uh...
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   this test drive they think will be used by more than a million people in the
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.280]   first year that's what they're expecting so they've got quite a few
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.360]   iPhones in the back there
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.880]   uh... you get a week long trial period with unlimited text data and calls you
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.920]   have to stay in the u_s_ obviously
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.880]   if you damage the phone hundred bucks that's all that's not bad
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.640]   cost more than that to fix a regular iphone
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.200]   uh... and this is all free of charge but i think he's really
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.840]   knocking at the park with the t-mobile
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.400]   he wants to let people know people has the iphone which has been a big challenge
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.720]   for them because i was a carrier to get it and it's right a great way to do it
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   uh... you you if you do it
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.440]   this is i think not and uh... this incentive
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.080]   you do the test drive you have to give it back even if you're gonna buy an
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.400]   i-phone you're gonna be brand new i-phone refer that
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.320]   so if you spent time setting up that test drive i phone your you
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.760]   i thought i got back up to the club of course what i think i'm a fool
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.320]   uh... and they also announced in that same uh... event there uh...
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.040]   free uh... data for music streaming services
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.120]   so which services rhapsody
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.240]   uh... spot of radio
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.840]   and itunes
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.560]   is pretty cool
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.880]   which some people thought was anti-nut neutrality and some people thought
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.560]   was just freestuff was a well it's funny i cast a gate at a t_n_t_ when they did
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.680]   the same thing they had a pro they have a program
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.640]   uh...
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.760]   that really but i think if you play favorites it's a it's a bigger problem
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   if it's like well our services free but everyone else is you have to pay for here
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.800]   the mobile saying all these popular services not all of them but it's a lot
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.360]   of them
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.040]   are panda panda i-heart radio items radio rhapsody spot of ice lacquer those of the
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.480]   five and nobody likes freaking out about six measuring data
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.840]   you know it like bandwidth caps right nobody likes
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.640]   you like all i'd like to listen to that song but man is gonna stream and i'm
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.000]   here my limit
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.440]   so eliminating that not for everything but for your streaming music is going to
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.160]   encourage people to stream these classes experience yeah also if you can
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.320]   give if you can give something away for free giving away music is pretty cheap
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.400]   right it's not really it's almost nothing
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.920]   it's not it's not video and also i think studies say that uh... you'd be surprised
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.440]   at how little it costs to streams potify and stream all these other services
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   uh... even over uh... or even over lt so it's not as though they're saying here
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.480]   have netflix twenty four seven
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.120]   uh... but it's still still a generous offer still this it's it's it's why t
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.640]   mobile's a fun company to think about also also keep in mind that they scheduled
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.600]   this they scheduled this event
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.880]   for the night
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.040]   of amazon's big uh... yeah it was not funny
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.840]   yeah same town too
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.360]   that's you you you like you like that kind of gumption and moxie that's that's
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.560]   fun that spirit
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.200]   does eighteen t offer unlimited streaming for beats
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.240]   because that they have that deal with beats
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.320]   no i'm aware of no
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.080]   and wisely they're not offering streaming for the apple podcast app which is
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.040]   what cost me bandwidth every
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.600]   hey uh...
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.400]   speaking of beats what what is that gonna happen
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   well part of all well any part of it i mean uh... it happened it hasn't gone
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.480]   after showing up at four thirty in the morning to get there no
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   fact that i didn't
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.640]   in fact dr_drais is in hollywood producing an album which is what he
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.320]   wants to do and always does
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.280]   uh... i don't know what jimmy iaveen is but i think he's taken some of that money
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.560]   and he's buying an island someone i think we will see
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.360]   a uh...
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.560]   so itunes was
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.400]   extremely absent at w_w_d_c_
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.080]   and that leads me to believe uh... that there is a huge drop about music remake
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.720]   that may be a new i tunes it may be a new music app who knows what it is but i
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.600]   feel like this fall will see
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.480]   that's true story they're not ready to tell yet but that they will be able to
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.440]   tell and i'm really hoping that it's like a music app and itunes is dead
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.760]   and continuity music
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.080]   and continuity for music which we asked about because that seems logical that
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.800]   you'd be able to walk away from your mac and your i-phone would just start
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   playing the music where you left it off
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.040]   uh... that's a and when i talk to apple about it uh... at w_w_d_c_
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.520]   you know in the sessions they said music was an example and yet they didn't
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.160]   show anything about it and i think that's because
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.280]   they're not ready to tell us what music's gonna look like in the fall
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.520]   just yet but
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.240]   i think there are changes happening there and that would be the logical time to
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.600]   talk about beats a little bit more to because hopefully the beats uh...
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.360]   streaming service would be part of that story to we don't know but i are you
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.240]   guys assuming that september will be an iphone and october of the ipad that
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.320]   usual
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.760]   watching the watch will be in october
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.960]   maybe a lot and then music would go with probably the october announcement
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.760]   or with the iphone
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.840]   yes usually September at least in person is an iphone i
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.880]   i thought i pod
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.080]   i tunes and then i pad mac
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.000]   and october
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.200]   yeah a little watch kind of messes with things
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.360]   but i do think something there's there's gotta be something going on that they
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.160]   didn't really even show
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.080]   i tunes doing anything and they didn't focus on it i feel like
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.800]   there will either be a new
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.160]   approach to items or there will be
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.360]   since they're taking
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.440]   uh... they're doing this photos app we don't really know the ultimate
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.320]   disposition of i photo but they're doing this new photos app it would be
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.080]   perfectly logical that there'd be a music app just like there is on the
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.200]   uh... on on the ios in a home automation at maybe uh... that home kit could be
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.480]   expanded to include
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.280]   your apple t_v_ that's one room where it should be used
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.360]   your watcher i phone your ipad
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.160]   apple t_v_ go ahead
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.360]   well g_o_s_ eight is always two place the new i_o_s_ is always two parts there's
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.880]   the first half they show off in in june with w_d_c_ and there's a second
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.360]   half they show off within you hardware that has more specific services would
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.720]   be no surprise to several new i_o_s_ features that would tie into both
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.840]   maybe new music services and new hardware
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.040]   right in september will be a touch ideas and i_o_s_ seven feature but they
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.360]   didn't announce it until they announced the phone because it was pointless
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.960]   until they had a sensor
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.040]   he had just had a horrifying thought
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.000]   i'll do i_m_a_ is not is not replacing the minis the mini dead i don't think
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.560]   no
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.640]   that room has been out there for a long time and they they sell pretty well and
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.880]   there i think the margins are pretty good and yeah people buy a mile have
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.720]   i have to win my house right now we've got a busy time for apple coming up in
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.760]   the next year and it's going to be even more insane than previous years which
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.840]   were insane
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.400]   yeah this is what they do
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.760]   and just to just that just the final dog and pony show demo of i_o_s_ eight and
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.080]   uh... you'll somebody together the shipping versions of how they work
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.640]   together that in itself could be a forty-five minute keynote and that's that
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.760]   stuff that they were already shown us so
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.080]   this is a read this is a profoundly exciting time maybe we'll get like an
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.160]   invitation that looks like a college schedule or something that says that
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.000]   is a couple's campus
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.560]   every Tuesday at ten a.m_ for the next eight weeks and we will announce on that
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   i would love that i know that
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.360]   i really would strive for the tuesday thursday one p_m_ but instead i got
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.360]   money was right at nine a_m_ uh... can't even like it's condo or something
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.520]   for the for the fall
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.800]   because if i have to keep flying from from boston does everything i do
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.120]   every week
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   extended stay motel for you when i first started a watching this video i thought
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.400]   that a_b_c_ was going to announce they did well invented the the
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.920]   the teleportation device but now
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.720]   in fact it's just a new uh... apple t_v_ uh... channel channel
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.760]   why is he looking over there what's unlike the app's on your i phone they're
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.760]   only about fifty apps might be looking over there
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.000]   so star
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.760]   is more interesting people about the shay things up and get to get to have two
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.400]   cameras on the shoot and they will let you know that yeah and they're not going
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.320]   to do any retakes this is straight through a_b_c_ news is now on apple
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.240]   t_v_
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.080]   what a surprise a_b_c_ is owned by disney
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.560]   which is practically owned by apple i mean i don't know what the relationship
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.800]   is there but it's pretty paul jobs
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.000]   yeah laurine pal jobs owns disney and uh...
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.340]   so she is actually the biggest alcohol the job is the biggest i call their
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.000]   disney
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.240]   it's still like six percent of some yeah
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.920]   hey it's billions
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.760]   more than i got you will get live i think one percent four separate live video
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.840]   streams including i guess local news right video news updates on the hour
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.240]   four to five live reports per day or they really need better channel management
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.440]   on the apple t_v_ interface it's getting a little out of control you're gonna
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.400]   this is the a_b_c_ channel alone nine t_v_ stations w_b_c_ in new york a_b_c_
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.560]   los angeles
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.960]   chicago's w_l_s_ p_v_ i from philadelphia k_g_o_ from san francisco
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.440]   k_r_t_k_
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.480]   i'm sorry k_t_r_k_ from houston
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.880]   you need a cable subscription to use it was it open
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.880]   uh... that's a good question i guess not cuz these are broadcast network and
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.500]   news for matthew panzerino of tech crunch k_f_s_n_ in frisnow
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.680]   is on what the hell and why and why
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.360]   frisnow i have a matthew patarino those are all owned and operated by that
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.040]   there are no such rights that's what it is cajio is uh... yeah it's owned and
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.440]   operated by a_b_c_ that's right it's exactly what it is
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.360]   and milwaukee to be why i saw
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.560]   curated stories and videos fifty years of historical footage
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.200]   from a b_c_ news including this week in history
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.640]   and the day in pictures
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.780]   on a franklin on battle the network stars all in your apple to
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.760]   that was a good show i like body frank
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.680]   uh... also p_b_s_ kids a_o_l_ on and willow a sports channel dedicated to
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.240]   international cricket
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.000]   finally the cricket channel
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.440]   finally had martigan
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.640]   and afflicher channels also been updated so that updated that go out uh... i
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.520]   think it goes out today today
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.840]   turn on your apple t_v_ so what you have more channels to turn off
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.280]   right
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.960]   hey don't turn off willow
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.880]   cricket is big you you'd like uh... you know we're sports we're just i don't
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.360]   yeah cricketers
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.720]   crickets kind of impact for those of us who are not in uh...
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.480]   a commonwealth nation crickets kind of impenetrable
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.760]   yeah i'm in a commonwealth nation and still impenetrable
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.160]   but can i get premier league football on my apple t_v_
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.880]   i think you can but mostly that's through the n_b_c_ sports network and i
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.640]   think you have a channel
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.080]   the everybody's got a channel on the apple t_v_ now
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.920]   a_b_c_ owns uh... yes p_n_ but there's a separate yes p_n_
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.480]   there's there's also the watch a_b_c_ app which is not the a_b_c_ news app
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.680]   which is not the watch yes p_n_a_ that's confusing yeah
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.720]   he's to get better
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.080]   yeah all right let's take a break when we come back my friends my boys
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.520]   my guys
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.640]   your pics
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.040]   of the week but first a word
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.320]   from our good friends at shutter stock they've got a brand new
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.600]   site called offset

[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.360]   i was mentioning i don't know i think it didn't get into the show because it was
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.920]   during a uh... reboot of the equipment of the gear
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.160]   that uh... last week you mentioned the sous vide thing that you just said you
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.200]   wanted your rich friends to buy
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.800]   a mellow
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.680]   i want to i want someone to buy one so that i can see how well it works and
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.600]   enjoy the food they cook with it
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.440]   it won't be out
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.480]   to the fall
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.520]   but you remember i ordered one
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.280]   and i got a very nice email from the the mellow fellow
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.680]   uh... his name is a
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:44.840]   uh... saying hey i saw uh... a big spike in the orders
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.440]   for the mellow
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.120]   and i couldn't figure out where it came from until i uh...
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.080]   i looked through the logs and i realized it came from your you know mac break
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.360]   weekly and i watched it and i was so happy
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.400]   uh... to see uh... you ordered on the air because i did order one that won't be
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.040]   out till next year
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.560]   but this is a sous vide cooker that looks pretty darn cool so say hello
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.400]   and uh...
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   cool
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.040]   so thank you for that pick last week even though you it wasn't something you've
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.760]   bought
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.640]   cost of the point of it is to have you are one to you
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.560]   awesome
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.760]   and the open it is a little bit more than one of the spike came from the
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.600]   uh... the twit was just the hosts
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.080]   i saw three sales it was all of us i think probably alex lindsey ball went
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.400]   to it's a bump
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.440]   man
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.120]   so what do you got for the what can i buy this week
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.600]   uh... well this is it's not something new uh... adobe has been sort of dilly
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:44.520]   dallying and dithering about whether or not to make one of their best
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.960]   uh... creative cloud deals a permanent thing
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.600]   uh... for ten bucks a month you get the the the uh... the photo package
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.200]   which is instead of getting the entire uh... the entire adobe
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.800]   uh... creative cloud suite
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.760]   if you can subscribe to the photography plan which only includes
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.200]   photoshop and adobe lightroom and that was ten bucks a month
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.320]   and was going to first was going to expire on in march and then they decided
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.520]   to extend the offer like another couple months
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.920]   uh... but uh... few days ago they they announced that okay this is now going to
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.240]   be a permanent thing
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.680]   ten bucks a month for photoshop and lightroom and if you are at all
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.480]   interested in taking photography to
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.400]   seven slightly a higher level
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.160]   it's just so worth it because the lightroom is a really great app just for
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.240]   organizing and
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.920]   and some things uh... even complicated enhancements to your photos
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.920]   that involve just you know
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.080]   pushing is a slider society opposed to having the stylism
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.760]   saying oh i want a third head on this on this guy came here i don't want just
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.720]   two heads on it
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.480]   uh... it's a for it to really allows you to organize and
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:47.080]   turn a really a really good jay pegerer raw into a really a image as good as your
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.840]   camera is capable of generating
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.800]   photoshop it's really intimidating for so many people and it should be because
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.320]   it's a professional grade image tool
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.360]   but what if you think of it as
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.200]   ten bucks a month for uh... for lightroom which is still less expensive over the
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.120]   year than it would cost in shrink wrap
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.000]   and getting photoshop for free
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.640]   now the next time you rotate an image or you do a panorama and their empty
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:09.520]   spots
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.600]   instead of thinking about what do i do to those blank white spaces you just
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.920]   simply move it into photoshop for one second
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.720]   spent all of ten seconds doing a smart phil where it will duplicate exactly what
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.000]   needs to duplicate to make those things happen
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.800]   and it did you get this perfect image all these things you can do with like two
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.760]   or three clicks that would be damn near impossible to do
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.600]   uh... in any other
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.720]   uh... there's the other so i i really think it's a good value i didn't i i
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.120]   didn't go i didn't plug for creative suite until they made this ten dollar
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.600]   month offer because i did just it makes sense to me to you know
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.200]   but for ten uh... absolutely i was already a lightroom user and i thought
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.920]   wow actually that's a great deal so we get a photo and it's because i was
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.600]   plotting along with like
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.520]   uh... for version four i think and i really had an
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.680]   i i got the demos whenever i had a review of them but i didn't really stick
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.520]   into them and boy what a great improvement is
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.400]   the other the other advantage to that though is that
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.520]   adobe is really making this subscription very valuable by adding all kinds of
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.600]   really cool services and mobile tools they came up with the
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.520]   i_o_s_ version of lightroom that allows you to do that kind of editing right on
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.160]   your tablet it has a lot of rod
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:15.240]   rod decoder and then there's the third thing which is speculative i know but
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:20.000]   uh... i'm one of the many things i'm really hot about for i_o_s_ eight is all
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.160]   the controls that apple is given to developers in developing their own
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.680]   camera apps now
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.480]   pretty much anything that the camera can adjust you can now a developer can
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.000]   adjust through their hardware this is not a good
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.560]   this is not a photoshop mix i'm showing here
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.200]   this is one of the new free apps for uh... the uh... i think that i was very
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.560]   easy to leave the background of a something in a shirt
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.080]   together and on on on an ipad air it is so quick and so select fun but i am
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.440]   but i'm i'm really i'm really keen to see what adobe does if they decide to
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.360]   expand the iphone version of their lightroom app
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.520]   from just an app that will edit
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.520]   photos you've already taken and
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.760]   develop their own camera app
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.640]   you know make this a all-in-one solution that will say
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.840]   you take the picture
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.720]   lightroom will allow you to adjust the brightness the color the contrast or
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.820]   could simply say
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.560]   you know what i know exactly what was wrong with that image if you take the
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.840]   picture again i can make sure the tone curve is adjusted properly the
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.400]   exposures proper the white balance is proper
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.880]   uh... and i'm just excited by the potential of that
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.760]   uh... so there's so i think there'll be a lot of
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.720]   additional benefits over the next year but even just today
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.160]   there's a if you're at all disappointed with the pictures that your
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.120]   five hundred dollar eight hundred dollar two thousand dollar camera takes
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.280]   right out of the box
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.320]   it's probably because you didn't do five minutes to ten minutes worth of
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.600]   adjustments in lightroom or or or aperture
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.640]   uh... with it that's what really makes those images pop that's what makes them
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.240]   sharp and crisp and the colors really nice
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.080]   uh... and because i i do
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.640]   i have to admit that i prefer
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.440]   apertures methodology and interface
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.400]   but apple really needs to give us some sort of a sign that they're going to be
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.280]   improving this and coming up with updates to it because
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.360]   it's been a couple it's been a couple years and still kind of slow compared a
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.480]   lightroom and
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:04.920]   i'd you just need some crumb in your basket to maintain the faith that
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.800]   this is this is not an abandoned product
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.200]   is a sign any sign
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.120]   uh...
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.080]   yeah i i thought ten bucks is good the one thing and why is he's pointing this out
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.160]   in the chairman i experienced it to that the new photoshop that you install
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.240]   when you
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.680]   uh... do this is twenty fourteen does not uninstall or replace the old
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.000]   photoshop
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.080]   so all your plugins are left hanging
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.200]   on the old photoshop i just copied him over i don't know if that's gonna work
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.080]   or not yet uh...
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.040]   but that's a little annoying
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.880]   that's not the way it's just
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.840]   just the amazing things you do with photoshop where you come up your
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.640]   vacation and you see this
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.400]   drunken yahoo in the background of the background of the kid you're not the
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:47.280]   nice picture you took of your kids with the with the bible the apple tower
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.680]   instead of having to spend two hours fixing this is literally lasso
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.980]   smart phil
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.960]   of it
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.240]   so
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.320]   rene richie your pick of the week
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.440]   i was actually going to pick the photoshop stuff if and he hadn't and i saw
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.120]   the sheet that he picked it already so i rapidly went to my
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.640]   my backup plan which is
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:09.960]   i'm a complete sucker for the lego games from lego star wars to lego batman to
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.140]   all of them and the lego marvel one is now available for i_o_s_ as of last
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:14.920]   week
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.680]   so if you enjoy
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.040]   you know the avengers the x-men the fantastic for
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.800]   uh... i stuck the video in the in the document as well
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.040]   uh... it these i've played most of these games on consoles with my god
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.720]   children because they're multiplayer and they're a lot of fun but if you want
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.120]   something you can take with you
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.840]   some you can have a car that's just
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.920]   you know it's fun entertainment there's there's not there's not a lot of
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.560]   this cartoon violence but there's no brutality
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.600]   uh... i just cannot recommend a lego franchise
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   well high enough it's just easy it's terrific gameplay
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.080]   fun for the entire family
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.480]   jason stald you have a tip of recommendation i do i do i i was searching
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.280]   through the the comprehensive mac break weekly document and at no
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.200]   point does the phrase launch bar seem to appear in there well we did recommend
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.120]   but you can recognize i'd well i think renee did did you not recommend it
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.560]   when you get an uleo you guys you guys uh... you updated your documented episode
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.000]   four hundred so perhaps it's back there
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.400]   anyway the one is not we're not talking about the launch
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.880]   quick launch for the uh... i_o_s_ that no no that is launched in a process
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.520]   launch bar way back when the version six just came out
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.280]   is a nice place to use this for a new thing i cannot use a mac without it is
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.440]   this korea who does this is this is objective development i think that's
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.720]   right yeah
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.320]   and it is great i cannot use a mac without it and it isn't just a quick
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.040]   launcher some people say well spotlight in
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.240]   in uh... you somebody will do all the things that these launchers will do it's
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.240]   not true
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.600]   uh... it does incredible things including launching files fast
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.680]   uh... picking what up a file opens in
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.800]   uh... doing math
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.640]   uh... rearranging text
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.320]   uh... so this is a crowded uh... category you got of course quick silver
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.680]   yes you've got alfred yes which is kind of the quick silver and then launched
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.720]   bar which is the oldie but goodie and uh... three you like launch bar i've
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.920]   always loved launch bar that is my favorite it looks much better now they
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.000]   did a huge uh... interface upgrade to make it look a lot prettier
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.160]   and uh... it added uh... a ridiculous assortment of new features plus has
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.720]   a extension support now so people can add on
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.960]   third-party extensions but it's um...
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.640]   versions you can you can try it out for free and i really recommend it as a
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.360]   productivity utility i use it all the time
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.000]   that's how i do
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.480]   almost everything on my mac is by a launch bar
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:30.200]   i have a version five license so i guess i can upgrade upgrade yeah
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.280]   you're trying to five yeah
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.040]   good i've i haven't seen launch bar nature so it's a quick launcher and and it
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.320]   and it has this idea of almost understanding sentences where you can
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.640]   you can pick a file in press tab and then type the app you want to open it in
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.920]   press return and then it opens thirty dollars for a single one says you go i
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.200]   found that one of the things that frustrates me about uh... spotlight is
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.400]   spotlight one to string that is found in the
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.320]   in the file that you're looking for and of course launch bar if you take the
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.240]   first couple letters it'll get the first words of the file it finds it
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.440]   right it's and it learns as you go
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.560]   scram gone i'm sorry i apologize you're right we haven't recommended this is
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.000]   two thousand nine see there you go so we're here's a reminder five years pass
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.120]   and
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.640]   part
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.480]   it's a little while
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.600]   i uh... i found a kind of interesting a little program uh...
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   my hearing is not all it should be and i was wondering
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.080]   how much of i lost as i have aged
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.240]   and i found a little program uh... a hearing tester
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.240]   that's free for the i-phone call me
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.080]   now there are other ones i really like this one i was doing it uh... last night
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.840]   uh... and is very similar with the audiologist test you'd want to use a
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.960]   good pair of headphones they say you can use it
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.720]   with your uh... your apple earbuds but i think it'd be better use a really high
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.800]   quality
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.720]   a pair of headphones and has a couple of nice features once you do the test just
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.960]   like an audiologist
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.560]   you have two buttons left and right it plays a variety of tones as soon as you
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.160]   can hear the tone you press the ear that you're hearing it in you want to try to
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.440]   issue a little test
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.880]   we have to be quiet because it doesn't it does see how noisy the environment is
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880]   uh... let's continue
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.320]   she's very very quiet
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.520]   now let's see if you can hear this
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.080]   ready
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.720]   you hear it yet
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.240]   tell me when you hear it
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.400]   and which year you hear it in
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.240]   i heard it in the right here
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.720]   so it's just we've ever done audiology test is exactly what this is
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.040]   uh... and then it gives you a profile this is the thing i found most interesting
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.320]   for sure the
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.360]   the screen i don't have the profile here i had it on my uh...
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.680]   uh... i've had a home
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.920]   but it'll show you what frequencies each year is capable of where there's a dip
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.480]   in frequencies and then this is really cool
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.440]   it'll show you what it if we fix these frequencies it'll play back sounds that
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.120]   fix the frequencies and give you full sound
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.600]   and it really shows you
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.960]   what you're missing
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.640]   especially as you get older
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.480]   uh... it told me i was sixty one years old
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.720]   so uh... it actually shows your hearing age my hearing age is better than i thought
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.480]   because i have fifty seven i mean that's only four years off
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.240]   so uh... find out what you're hearing ages here what you're missing and then if
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.160]   you're one of them youngsters it has good hearing it can simulate what people
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.880]   like me are hearing
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.720]   you can actually try different ages and see why i keep saying start mumbling
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.200]   you why you should fear the future
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.000]   uh... it really is a nicely done app it's absolutely free it's called meaning
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.600]   hearing test and it's uh... i phone only
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.160]   uh... and my recommendation
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.720]   thank you everybody what a fun show this has been jason's not appreciate you're
