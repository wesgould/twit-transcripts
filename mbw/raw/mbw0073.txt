[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 72.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   We're going to wrap up what's been an amazing Macworld Expo.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.520]   And on the panel, once again, we've
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640]   got the usual suspects starting on my left.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.760]   You're right.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.600]   We are on the show floor at Macworld Expo, by the way.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.080]   Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, yes.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.300]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.400]   How are you this afternoon?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   43folders.com.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.360]   And next to him, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.760]   the pufant of all Mac knowledge, it is Chris Breen.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.200]   Hello.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.160]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.840]   The guy who gave you that name, the macalope, is here somewhere.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   Really?
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   Did you see the lope?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.600]   I actually-- I met the lope earlier.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   He had gotten entangled in some wires.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.880]   And I was--
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.640]   Well, those antlers.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Leo, is he able to help him out?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.720]   And now he owes me a wish.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.120]   That's good.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.040]   If you could see the macalope and you can pet him,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   you get a wish.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.320]   So he's here.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.000]   And we were trying to figure out how to get him on stage
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760]   without revealing his persona.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   We haven't figured that out yet.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.120]   Macalope, if you're here--
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.560]   oh, look, here comes Andy and Akko strolling up the aisle.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.760]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.840]   Are we out of microphones?
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.320]   We're out of good microphones.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.480]   So we have to give Andy a bad one.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.520]   Just come on in and eat.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.360]   So as I was saying, the Bufan of all knowledge, Chris
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.920]   Breen of Macworld Magazine.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   I did it again.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   It used to be Mac user.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   It used to be Mac users.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.600]   Now Macworld Magazine.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.120]   Who was it?
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.000]   And Mac Week 2.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.960]   He's been giving lessons in how to hack your iPhone all week.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.480]   And you're touch.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.520]   We've been doing iPhone stuff.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.760]   And that's cool.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.520]   The jailbreak.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.480]   It is cool.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720]   Leo had updated his phone to 113.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   And I--
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.000]   I can't do it because I updated, right?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.280]   Yeah, and it's too bad.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.240]   But you're out of luck.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.440]   However, I mean, I'll give you these--
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.760]   I don't want to do anything to my iPhone.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.080]   Having had the experience now of bricking,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   I don't want to do anything to my iPhone that's
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.240]   going to keep me from taking the next Apple Rev.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.200]   Right.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.280]   However, some people have found that when they have tried
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.600]   to update their iPhone, there is a scary moment.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.520]   I believe that Andy had one of these scary moments just
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.160]   the other day.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   Andy and Oco, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.520]   I had--
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.880]   --cago sun times.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.240]   Thank you.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   I had one of those moments when you
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560]   realize that at this very day you're
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.040]   not counted amongst God's most beloved, where I applied the update.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.240]   I was giving a talk promoting my iPhone books.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.840]   I was going to be needing my iPhone.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   All my appointments were also for the day on my iPhone.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.280]   I applied the update in the morning,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.160]   verified that it had taken, verified that the patch worked,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920]   that everything was working as it should.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.280]   Then and only then did I turn it off and leave my hotel.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760]   Then I jumped in a cab, flicked on my iPhone
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.360]   to find out when my next appointment was
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.480]   to find that I was being invited to connect a USB connector
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.280]   into a planet.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.360]   No.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.920]   So all that needed to do was, again, connect back into iTunes
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680]   to re-verify my account with iTunes.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.640]   But I would like to think that it would say, you know,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.800]   Andy, don't leave the hotel room just yet,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.040]   because there's still stuff left to do.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.800]   I felt as though I had been lied to and deceived.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.240]   I just love it that when you press and hold an icon--
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.880]   You get to dance.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.080]   --the icons jiggle and they keep jiggling until you press
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.440]   home.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.800]   They just go jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.280]   Scott, born, do you like that feature?
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.160]   Is that something you enjoy?
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   You're wearing a perfect shirt for it.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.480]   Actually, I have to say that I was the model for that.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.760]   Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.600]   Here we go.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.400]   I was talking to him.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.960]   Here we go.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.480]   Let's see.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   I don't need to--
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.360]   This is why we don't do video, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.640]   Oh, my god.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.280]   The human man.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.640]   And now you see why I have a career in radio.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.360]   Mac Brick Weekly, we've got mid-sections made for radio.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.600]   I have a friend who's in his 70s.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.520]   And he didn't realize that he'd got it jiggling.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.720]   And he thought his eyesight was going.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.040]   He said, oh, my god.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.360]   It started.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.720]   Because it kind of looks like that.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.080]   It's in Keith Moon mode.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.560]   I think it's a cool feature.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.200]   It's kind of neat.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   It is.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   I think-- I mean, you got to give him some credit.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   There could be other things it was doing.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.320]   The dance is kind of cool.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.920]   Also, here Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.040]   Hello.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   That's his usual greeting.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.360]   Hello.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.960]   Hello.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.840]   Hello.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.520]   Alex must be the most exhausted man
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.020]   here.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.440]   You have been keeping this podcast studio going
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.520]   for round the clock for five days, four days.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.680]   It seemed like a really good idea when I thought it up.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.600]   You know, that was my-- it seemed like a really good idea
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.840]   when I agreed to do it.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.520]   Yeah, it's been really fun.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.800]   I have to admit that this corner is all I've seen at Mac World.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.360]   But--
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.600]   You haven't been to the floor?
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.100]   No.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.800]   I keep on thinking I was going to get to the floor.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.480]   And then there would be something else that needed to get
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.880]   sorted out and something else that needed to get sorted.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.000]   My daughter, Abby, is here.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.640]   We went over to see the MacBook Air.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.720]   And did you-- Abby, where are you?
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.320]   Did you want it?
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.160]   Do you want it?
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.840]   No.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.640]   I'll take hers.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.840]   You know, I--
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.640]   Thanks, Uncle Leo.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.320]   After thinking about it, playing with it and looking at it,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.600]   it's beautiful.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.080]   Seems pricey, underpowered.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.720]   And mostly, I'm afraid I'm going to sit on it.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.880]   Two gigs of RAM that you cannot add to.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   No way to update the battery yourself.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.840]   It's $129 I found out to do the--
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.480]   I price it out with all the things that most of us
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.120]   would actually want, because you end up using all kinds--
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   like a dongle optical drive, a dongle ethernet port, a blabber.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.080]   It's around $2,400 after tax.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.920]   And that's roughly twice the price of a MacBook that's
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.440]   got stuff the Air does.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.840]   But let's defend at least Apple's logic.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.760]   When I had my briefing with Apple, yes, I questioned, gee,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.920]   how come there's no ethernet?
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.400]   I've never seen a laptop without the other--
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.840]   they don't say that they did this because they wanted
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.640]   to make it smaller or because they wanted to reduce the price
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.120]   pointer and increase the profit.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.240]   The answer to all those questions, as always,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.280]   we have a firm picture in our minds
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.400]   of the sort of person who wants to buy this.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.880]   And to them, they don't really need wired ethernet all
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.640]   that much.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.560]   And I have to frankly say, I have two power books with me,
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.120]   a MacBook in my older power book.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.400]   One of the reasons why the power book
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.120]   is the older power book is that the disk drive doesn't work
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.880]   anymore.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.600]   I have been living without an optical drive for the past
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.680]   like year.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.480]   And frankly, I haven't really missed it.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.040]   Even when I had to install iWork off of CD onto it,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.680]   I simply used a different machine to make a disk image of it.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.240]   Andy, you can get a more--
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.080]   what about Scott's point?
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.400]   You can get a more powerful computer for half the price.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.200]   Sometimes a more powerful computer
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.560]   means that the computer can count to a million
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.280]   instead of 100,000 between your keystrokes.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   Show me, brother, I can't use--
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.360]   Who is the MacBook Air designed for?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.320]   It's for a very, very rich man who
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.600]   wants a fourth computer.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.960]   Scott Born, then.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.160]   This is the perfect machine to sit and surf Wikipedia
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.760]   while you're watching TV.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.240]   That's it.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.840]   And I mean, I think I said this last time.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.400]   I don't remember.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.800]   I haven't slept much.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   But it seems to me that this would be--
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.240]   Turn him up.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.920]   We need more Merlin.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.880]   Robble, Robble, Robble.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.280]   It seems to me that this is hard to open in coach
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.720]   when the person in front of you is fully--
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.080]   Every laptop's hard to open.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.400]   Not the 12-inch Leo, not the 12-inch.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   He's still holding out for his 12-inch.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.160]   I buy everything, right, Leo?
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.200]   I'm not buying this.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.280]   Yeah, same with me.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.520]   I just can't.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.880]   Are you buying one, Andy?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.200]   I'm certainly not going to buy one
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   because I have a MacBook that works perfectly fine.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.000]   But I could certainly see somebody for whom--
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.520]   not-- if there are a lot of people for whom
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.960]   that slimness is actually a big feature.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   The MacBook is not as easy to carry around outside of a bag.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   If you look at this stage, your slimness is not a feature.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.040]   I don't know.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.760]   But I suppose I'm waiting for the MacBook fat.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   That is my computer.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.240]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.560]   I like to call it the Toughbook.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   So I can imagine.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   I can see Paris Hilton walking around with her little air.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   I can see Brittany using the--
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   Yeah, but it's covered with all crappy rhinestones.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.000]   No, but that's what it's for.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.400]   It's a purse notebook.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.040]   Let's face it.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.200]   It's a purse computer.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.600]   Yeah, but it's too big for that.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   Oh.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.720]   Well, it's a Minoa--
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.680]   All right, show of hands.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.920]   Here we got about 250 people in the audience.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.000]   How many of you have ordered a MacBook Air?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.280]   You sure are the richest man in the building?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.480]   How many of you think you might in the next month?
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.240]   Few more.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.520]   How many of you would pay the same amount of money
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.720]   for an Intel version of the 12-inch power book?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.560]   Yeah, baby.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.440]   There you go.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.920]   That's what people want, the 12-inch.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.040]   And we have a winner.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.440]   The 12-inch power book is one of the few Macintoshs
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.720]   that I actually hated.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   Oh, geez.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.840]   Here we go.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.960]   It's of no-- it's of no you.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.000]   Andy, I don't have a 12-inch lap.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.560]   I don't have a 12-inch lap.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.440]   Why do I want a 12-inch power book?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.080]   It's like the honeymooners.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.960]   It's like the first two big star records.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.520]   It was not appreciated properly during its time.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.840]   And we are finally realizing how good it is now
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.720]   that it's gone and you're crazy.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   12-inch Mac, we hardly knew you.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.840]   If I could have heard what you said,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.160]   I'd have a really witty rejoined.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.280]   I said, I said, "Robble, Robble, Robble, Robble, Robble."
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.120]   You said you are so right, Andy, I agree with every word
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.640]   you said.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840]   God bless you, Berlin man.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.520]   You did that.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.240]   You did that, children.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.120]   You were finished talking, I found that I--
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.000]   Now on our last episode, we didn't talk about one item,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   one new product, the capsule.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.880]   What is that, the time capsule?
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.600]   And you know what?
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.000]   What?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.760]   Nobody else is talking about it either.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.160]   Oh, well maybe that's the problem.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.120]   Oh, they're talking about it.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.800]   They're talking about how Steve Jobs personally walked up
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.400]   to you and kicked you in the butt and made fun of you
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.000]   for having bought the previous base station,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.440]   is what the people are saying.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.760]   I've never seen so many people take a product announcement
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.200]   so personally.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.000]   Really?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.240]   Now, but it's more expensive than an airport extreme.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.320]   It's certainly more expensive.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.560]   How much is the time capsule?
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.640]   500 megabytes was $2.99?
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.000]   Yeah, 400 gigabytes actually.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.240]   500 gigabytes, right.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000]   The one terabyte was $4.99.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   $4.99.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.560]   That seems like not an unreasonable amount.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   It's a full base station too, right?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.200]   I mean, it's not--
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.520]   Right.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.640]   I'm not saying it's a bad product.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.760]   I'm just saying I've noticed a complete lack of coverage
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.400]   in the Mac press on-- I mean, they're talking about everything
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   but that device.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.800]   I just-- can we do it quick?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.200]   Does anybody care about that out there?
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.360]   You care about it, but we're not hearing about it.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.560]   Well, one thing that I'm curious about
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   is what is the expandability?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.840]   And I didn't get that from the keynote of,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.200]   can we add more drives?
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.520]   I mean, I know that terabytes seems like a lot to a lot of people.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.840]   It's not a lot to me.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.520]   And I'm worried about it.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.880]   Can I add more?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.520]   That's what I want them to be able to add on top or below.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.120]   I mean, it seems to me that they've taken what was basically
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.360]   a flawed technology, which was air disk, which was supposed
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.000]   to be part of that--
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   Right.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.240]   Didn't happen.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.720]   Right.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.880]   And then they added a hard drive and said, ah, now it works.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.440]   But look at this.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.120]   Now it works.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.640]   And all we had to do was add a hard drive
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.200]   and charge you for another device.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.760]   A terabyte network attached storage device
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.440]   is going to cost you 800 or 900 bucks.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:43.920]   Right.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.160]   So it's much more expensive.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.000]   Now on the other hand, it's RAID 5.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.480]   So it's got redundancy.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.080]   It's going to be more reliable.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.960]   But I mean, I think $4.99 for a terabyte.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.040]   That's not a bad price.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.440]   And you're getting a backup and it's using time machine.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.320]   It's a good price.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.240]   I think it's a good price.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.520]   OK.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.480]   Now what happens when the hard drive craps out?
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   Well, you know, that's your backup.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.360]   How do you rotate offsite with that?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.680]   Oh, come on, you guys.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.480]   I think it's a good product.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.200]   I mean, I'm asking hard questions.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.480]   I know.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.560]   I'm very interested in it.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:12.760]   But like--
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.960]   No, it's the same problem you'd have with any other backup
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.320]   device.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.480]   If you want to do it offsite, use mosey.com or use iDisk.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.720]   You have other solutions.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.800]   But this is your time machine hard drive.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.400]   You could use Drobo with time machine too.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.200]   I use Drobo.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.120]   That's what I'm going to buy.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.200]   Yeah, I use Drobo.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.080]   Drobo is pricey, though.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.880]   Drobo is $4.99 without any drive.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.520]   I understand.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.600]   But I can add drives to it.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.840]   And I can swap drives from it.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.560]   And I can take those drives.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:32.760]   No, I did that.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.680]   In fact, I have two terabytes of my Drobo now,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.840]   because I put four, 500 gigabyte drives in there.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   Drobo's noisy as hell, though.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.920]   I got to warn you.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.360]   OK.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.480]   Sounds like Drobo's taking off when you're backing up.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.440]   It's quiet when it's not.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.120]   But we'll keep it out of the studio.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.280]   Yeah, that's what you do.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.840]   You just do--
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.480]   Has anybody played with it?
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.280]   Is it noisy?
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   Do we know this time capsule?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.840]   Do we know anything about it?
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.520]   Has anybody met it?
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.160]   Has anybody--
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.480]   No, we're just sliding it aside on steam.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:56.920]   I'm not going to touch it.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   I'm not going to touch it.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.320]   There was one there at the briefing.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.760]   I held it.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.360]   I touched it.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.200]   I called it George.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   But it was not pumped.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.400]   How big is it?
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.720]   It's as big as the airport extreme?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.400]   It's your basic Kitchenette Hot Plate size device that--
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.800]   --will put it back--
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.120]   --in the airport extreme with a drive in it.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.600]   And once again, you get back to Apple's
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.040]   saying the exact same thing.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.600]   I wanted to know, is it just for time machine backups,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.280]   or can I use it as standard network storage?
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.600]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.240]   Do I want to-- can I use--
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.680]   host my iTunes library on it?
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.160]   And they said explicitly, yes, it just appears
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.640]   in the Finder as a standard drive.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   As a standard drive, you can use it for wherever you want.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.400]   But-- and again, we get to that line again--
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.840]   that we feel as though we understand the person who's
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.440]   going to buy this.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.560]   And we think the most people who are going to buy this
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.640]   are people who just want a magical box on the network
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.720]   that handles all that--
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   I think I think--
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.120]   On that basis, it's a great product.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.920]   And I think there's people who should do that.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.840]   My mom.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.480]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.800]   Well, it's nice to say-- I'll tell you what.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.840]   OK, so let's-- I don't like to go down this route
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.520]   into the whole like these notional idiot parents people
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.000]   always talk about, or idiot grandparents.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.560]   But my parent is an idiot.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.000]   That's true.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.560]   Mine are too.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.760]   In effect, my daughter is--
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.400]   My daughter's going, I know about that, idiot.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.000]   Yeah, that's my dad.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.800]   So I mean, the thing is, if you really
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.440]   want to trick something out, you could go out.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.880]   And I've got a ready NAS that I like a lot for doing
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.240]   network backup stuff.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   And if you want to really trick out a router,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.520]   you'll get an old link set.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.160]   That's a different market.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.320]   And comma.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.840]   I think that's a different market.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.520]   I think what you're describing-- time machine
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.080]   is something I've had a little bit of a hard time
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.920]   getting my head around.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.840]   I don't like time machine now.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.240]   You know what I'm using time machine for?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.560]   Like if preferences get corrupted,
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   I'd give you a roll back and stuff like that.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.040]   I run Chrono Sync backing up to the Drobo.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.560]   And I don't want to do time machine.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.400]   I'm running our sync on two drives.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   Exactly.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.160]   I wrote a tape.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.840]   Smart, better, faster.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.960]   Time machine is overkill if you ask them.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   Believe it or not, I feel as the backup utility
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.640]   you get for free with .Mac, the problems
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.600]   I had with my hard drive crash on Monday,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.520]   I probably would not have been quite as deeply in the soup
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.960]   if I were using that free program for backup.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.000]   Because it makes it very, very easy to say, oh, you know,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.160]   this subset of files, put it on my .Mac at the same time,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.880]   and please make sure you do that every night.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   I love SuperDuke.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.680]   SuperDuke is, I think, the greatest backup program ever.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.240]   I heard somebody told me SuperDuke, when it comes out,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.600]   is going to be Leopard compatible,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.360]   is going to be Time Machine compatible,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.920]   and is going to make a bootable Time Machine backup.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.200]   Somebody told me that.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.520]   That's a product, isn't it?
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   That's the real problem with Time Machine.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.360]   You can't boot.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   I go out to dinner with the present.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   Well, you know better than I.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.080]   And they've been trying to get that version out the door.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.360]   They have real-- so much so that when I asked for screenshots
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   of the next version to put in my Leopard book,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.600]   they said, we're doing so much work on this
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.000]   that we can't even show you an alpha at this point.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.240]   There's a lot of work that's being done,
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.600]   but we want to really kick some butt with this release.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   Good.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.240]   So they're not showing it to me yet,
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.320]   and I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.400]   But I think the network storage, where
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.360]   the local network storage, or to .Mac,
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.400]   or some other random, other remote backup,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.760]   that really has to be part of any backup regime.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.200]   And I will lay my fealty to anyone
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   who comes up with a great backup system that
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.320]   allows me to just as transparently put something
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.680]   on box.net or .Mac.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.200]   Right.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.720]   I mean, or S3.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.240]   Now, there's jungle--
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.120]   I read the Amazon, right.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.040]   Have you tried Jungle Disc?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.800]   Because that's pretty cool.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.600]   Have not tried Jungle Disc?
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.720]   That's an inexpensive program that we'll use S3 as a web--
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.800]   it turns S3 to a web dev device.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.680]   So then you could use anything to back up to it.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.160]   Right.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.720]   I think that's a really neat program.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.480]   You should take a look at that.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.320]   I finally went to Costco and just bought two--
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.560]   I followed the J-- if you all see on his live journal,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   JWZ had a great piece of advice on how to do backup.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.160]   Yeah, the big trick.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.440]   You basically go out and buy two--
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.280]   have you seen that?
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.640]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.480]   Go out and buy two hard drives that
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.920]   are identical to the hard drive that's in your Mac
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.480]   for the day when your hard drive dies.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.080]   And he has this basic one line of R-Sync
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.840]   that every day will do diffs and do the backup for you
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.360]   without you having to think about it.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.680]   You run that as a cron job.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.440]   You never see it.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   And it's bootable, right?
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.640]   It's totally bootable.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.080]   You could do this with Superduper.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.880]   I'd freak you out a little bit.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.440]   Not what you can't, though, right?
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.160]   That's the problem.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.040]   Because it doesn't work with Leopard now, right?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.360]   I think Superduper is not totally Leopard friendly.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.320]   Yeah, it's time.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.240]   But here's what I think.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.600]   Backup to me, backup-- we go over this probably
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.680]   about every quarter.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.240]   But I think the thing to remember with backup
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.000]   is if it's not-- there's two things.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.960]   In order for backup to be real, it
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.680]   has to be completely automated.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.280]   And you can laugh about it, but you've also
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.040]   got to have off-site rotation, or your backup is worthless.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.960]   Because something will go wrong with what you've got there.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.880]   Again, that's the reason why I don't have my backup drive
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.520]   with me.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.600]   The idea of traveling with the--
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.920]   It's letting the vice president fly with the president.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.280]   I was supposed to see the exact same thing.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.040]   You just don't do that.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.120]   Maybe we should do more of that.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.200]   Just remember that no file.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.240]   Someone says someone who--
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   I didn't say that.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   I love this country.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   I am shocked and offended Mr. Scott
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.800]   Borne, who is the one who said that are not me, and you not go.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.040]   Hey, if Randy Newman can do a song, I can do a joke.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.560]   He's got an Oscar.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.000]   He is America.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.840]   He's our coach about the president.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   So what did we-- what else did we
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.600]   see outside of these things that were really that stood out
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   this week?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   I'm going to throw my lot in with the Mac speech people who
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.280]   make eye dictate.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.400]   I wanted to see that.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240]   It's good.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.800]   It works.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.840]   It works really well.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.400]   It works.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.000]   It works.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.080]   OK, tell us about-- a lot of people in the audience
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.040]   are going to miss.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.560]   Tell us about this.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.960]   It's using the dragon, naturally speaking,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.320]   which has always been the best engine.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.200]   Always the best engine.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.440]   They have been the gold stack.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.720]   And this is-- but this is not dragon, naturally speaking,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.800]   for the Mac.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.960]   They're just using their engine.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.560]   It's their technology on top of this thing.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.760]   And it works.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.680]   I mean, finally-- you know, it's--
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.280]   you go and see the demo of this thing,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.600]   and knowing the history of the company,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.720]   you try to find a polite way to say,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.960]   you know, what you're doing before was terrible compared
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.480]   to this.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.040]   But now that they have this coming out,
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.560]   you can say, this actually works.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.280]   In the past, when people would write into Mac 9-1-1
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.080]   and say, look, I really need to do speech dictation on my Mac.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.120]   How do I do it?
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.840]   Well, you get a PC.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.240]   And now, or you run bootcamp and you do this thing,
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.880]   or you do some convoluted thing through either Fusion or--
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.600]   or TeraLus.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.000]   And now you don't have to.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.120]   This works so nicely.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   And I think--
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.200]   I think it's 199, isn't it?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.520]   Oh, here's the trick.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.680]   Go down and buy a copy of I-Listened now,
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.640]   which is like going on sale for like $29 or $49.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.360]   There will be--
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.240]   That's the earlier product.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.800]   As long as you buy, I-- if you bought I-Listened with--
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.040]   and the product manager told me this--
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.760]   he said, if you buy this within 2008
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.200]   and you wait for I-dictate to come out,
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.720]   it's like a $29 or $49 upgrade.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.760]   So you're going to save like $100.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.720]   You've all learned something here today.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.200]   But notice that it is only for Intel Mac.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   So if you have a PowerPC Mac, you're out of luck.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.360]   But I-Listened will work on a PowerPC Mac, but it's not as good.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.680]   One of the things-- I think this is actually--
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.520]   it could be better than actually having
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.880]   Dragon software on the Mac.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.080]   Because what you have is someone using their engine
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   but able to develop it and customize it for the Mac.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.640]   It's not like, oh, we have a program that
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.960]   has to run on a Mac and a PC.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.680]   So we can't do this.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.640]   We can't do that.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.120]   It really is something that's running on the Mac.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.320]   It doesn't have to run on something else.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.160]   It probably will never run on something else
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.320]   from that point of view.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.160]   And I think it's--
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.280]   I was really excited.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.320]   That's the one thing I saw because I saw it before the show
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:02.680]   started.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.720]   I got to take a look at it.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.200]   And it was fantastic.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.800]   I mean, it was--
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.360]   Well, they're using a ton of Apple's APIs under there.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.120]   So they're using a lot of the assisted devices stuff.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   So no, it can't run on anything else.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.600]   So this really is, except for the engine.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   This is really a Mac-only kind of product.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.360]   It can do us some brilliant stuff.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   Let me just-- I wish I'd gone over and looked at it.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   Some mechanical questions.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.600]   So can I be sitting in Microsoft Word, for instance,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.680]   and use its engine and it will put the words into Word?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.120]   And then you can switch applications.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.080]   So you can be in-- say you're in text edit or you're in BD
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.320]   editor or something like that.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.280]   And you can dictate.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.600]   And then you can say copy, open Microsoft Word, paste.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.200]   You can issue formatting commands.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.040]   You can issue anything that's in the menu
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.760]   can be issued as a command.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.600]   Now, we got a guy in the audience who's apparently a big fan.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.760]   He says, five minutes set up.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.960]   He said it was very quick to set up.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.680]   Five minutes to train.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.560]   Did you try it?
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.600]   Has anybody actually tried it?
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.160]   And like-- because the problem with these
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.200]   is they demo gray.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.760]   But I've actually used Dragon Naturally Speaking
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.120]   on the YouTube--
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   Right.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.000]   --the latest version.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.880]   And that doesn't take much training either.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.080]   So--
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   I hate to say this.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.800]   But apparently Mr. Inako is bored.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.760]   He set up his iPhone is watching a movie here.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.240]   Oh, now that's ridiculous.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.120]   He's got a Gorilla pod.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.960]   And he's watching the Macado.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.720]   What are you doing?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.760]   It's not the Macado.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.840]   It's the celestial diatodabra.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.720]   It's the queen of the night.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.360]   It dies up.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   That's up for Pludie.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.480]   You're watching opera?
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   Of course.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:26.960]   He is--
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.440]   There's nothing but culture.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:28.960]   --it's called--
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.440]   --Culture.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:29.920]   --Culture.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.400]   Maybe culture.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.160]   Now, I want to know how you got the Gorilla pod
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.960]   to hold the iPhone like that.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.800]   I want to-- there are lots of really cool little things.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.680]   This is one of my favorite things I've gotten
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.920]   at the show so far.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.640]   The Gorilla pod is this really cool three-legged tripod
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.200]   that works like a regular tripod.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.760]   But the individual legs, if you can imagine,
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.960]   are like an alien finger with like five tight knuckles on it
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.360]   so that you can put it on your tabletop
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   like a regular tripod.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.600]   But if you've got a bar or a stand like that,
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.360]   you can actually bend these legs around to wrap around
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.400]   and grab it from any angle.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.440]   And so they've had these Gorilla pods for a long time now.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.360]   They added a very, very simple change to it though.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.720]   They made the head of it modular.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.320]   It used to just end in the regular sort of screw jack
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.400]   that you'd put into the bottom of any camera.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.280]   Now you can take that off.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.000]   You can put on a suction cup.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   So we'll hold on to your iPod, your iPod, just like this.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.600]   So I am so looking forward to my flight home.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.480]   I finally have something that I can put it on my tray table,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.640]   adjust it to any angle.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.680]   I can wrap it around the headrest in front of me,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.920]   wrap it around something in the overhead compartment
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.440]   and have it bending down into any angle.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.280]   This is just, it's such a simple, stupid thing,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.320]   but it is giving me a great deal of joy.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.000]   I don't do dictation.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.480]   I have never, I really respect the technology.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.880]   I know what a breakthrough it is,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.960]   but I'm not the sort of person who can say,
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.640]   I don't like reading my own stuff,
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.880]   much less having to speak it aloud.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.200]   - Yeah, but it's like this much bigger deal.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.040]   - So it's like this one, a tripod,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.120]   he gets all excited.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   (laughing)
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.240]   - Hey man, if you were watching Diana Damra,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.080]   I was the queen of the night,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.280]   you'd be getting excited too.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.120]   - Ooh.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.440]   - So this is probably what we're all on Skype.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   We're all, you know, we're actively engaged
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.320]   in deep conversation about the Macintosh.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.160]   - And we now know what he's doing.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.960]   - And we now know what Inako is doing in Boston.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.720]   - And nobody would have known about it
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.760]   unless you blew a cotun everybody about it.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.320]   - Oh, I thought Dunscap Studio was just a studio,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.600]   little did I know.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.800]   - It's a whole wing under my broadcast center.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600]   It is, it is, it is.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.120]   Any other finds at Macworld Expo
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.200]   that people want to share?
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.320]   I'm not gonna ask you Alex,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.560]   you haven't left the booth all day.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.760]   - Yeah, there's this really good booth with green screen
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.040]   and that's the only other booth I saw.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.400]   - So what Alex, what is your review
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.920]   of the concession stand in the back there?
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.000]   I bet you know all about what they're doing well,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.320]   what they're not doing well.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.120]   - Well, I have to say that the tea is very expensive.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.440]   (laughing)
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.280]   - Hey, I would have--
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.920]   - Unlike other items, sir.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.560]   - I want to talk about a deal I found.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.400]   - A deal.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.240]   - A deal.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.200]   - If you've got an iPhone, and of course I've got
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.720]   a couple of them, maybe more.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.160]   He's got a vest made of iPhones, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.360]   - Bend a lee, like a baby deal.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.520]   - There's a booth over in the other hall,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.600]   a company called SAG,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.480]   and they make a product called Invisible Shield.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.280]   And if you've got any kind of case on your iPhone
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.760]   and you walk over there,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.320]   they're gonna ask you,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.840]   "Would you like to go naked?"
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.560]   Now they didn't ask me that for obvious reasons,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   but if you would like to donate your case,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.640]   what they will do is hand you a free invisible shield
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.840]   on the spot. - Oh, that's nice.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.920]   - So if you've got a case,
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.240]   now for those of us that are speakers here,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.560]   we got like six free cases,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.960]   so you could just take-- - Like 106 cases, yeah.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.920]   - Yeah, so you could just take one of those free cases there
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.200]   and they'll put a free thing.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.520]   And I gotta tell you, here's a true story.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.880]   At Christmas time, I have a relative
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.160]   who's developmentally disabled
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.800]   who thought it might be a great idea to take a key
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.560]   and try to gouge all the way diagonally across my iPhone.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.680]   - I think, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.120]   - And successfully put a pretty nice gouge
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.800]   in the invisible shield,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.440]   upon removing the invisible shield, not one scratch.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.920]   - You're kidding. - Not one scratch.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.440]   - That's a testimony.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.560]   - That's the sweetest Christmas story I've ever heard.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.440]   - Isn't that touching?
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.080]   - It's the way my family works, you know.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.920]   - And that's what Christmas means.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.000]   - But anyway, look for that.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.120]   - What do I have to do to get invited?
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.480]   - I'm not telling you to buy one.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.360]   I'm telling you, you can get a free one
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.720]   because I had to kind of piggyback on Chris's,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.440]   Chris had to deal with his thing.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.280]   So my thing-- - Yeah.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.840]   - I love these fine art,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.760]   did you see these fine art covers that they had?
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.840]   They were beautiful.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.200]   - Yeah, that's a different company.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.040]   - It's a different company.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.200]   I get, what was the name of the company, Abby?
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.400]   I can't, I can't.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.720]   Jelkins, was that it?
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.040]   I love, there you go.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.400]   Look at those, they're just beautiful
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.240]   and a lot of people got them.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.200]   - Oh yeah, those are in the bag.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.040]   - Oh yeah, wait a minute.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   - Wait a minute, what,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.400]   the one kid up front, his dog?
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.240]   - But they have a variety.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.520]   - Can we ask that young man, that's my friend Grant.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.040]   Can you come up here and maybe show that to us?
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.600]   Grant, could you come up and show us?
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.280]   - Grant's also got something on his forehead.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.120]   I don't know what that is.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   - That's the other good deal, Linda Docon.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   - Oh, Linda Docon, yeah, it's Linda Docon.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.840]   - It's a Linda Docon, Wednesday.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.120]   - So Greg, show us your Jelkins.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   - Go for it.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.120]   - Well, it's, well, the Girls Gone Geek thing just came up
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   before you were here and we are sitting there waiting for you
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   guys to come up and I was there.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   They were giving up prizes and I got this.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   - So we won this from the Girls Gone Geek.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   - All right, thank you, really.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   Girls Gone Geek, hi girls.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   GirlsGoneGeeks.tv.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   Yeah, we got that one for Abby, but I look,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   if you go on the back, they have like this Mario.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   That's like this surreal Mario.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   He's got a black eye and a Jel number in front of him.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.120]   It's like Mario and Jel.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   It's great art.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   It's beautiful and it would go on your laptop or your phone
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   or your iPod touch.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   I think they're really, I thought it was one of my favorite things
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   at the show.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   - Can I ask Grant, Grant, what was your favorite thing
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   you saw today?
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   - I don't really know.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   There are so many really cool things.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   I liked the invisible shield.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   I liked the I have record thing.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120]   - I record.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   What's that?
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   Tell us about that.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   - It was this little box that you hook up to like a DVD player
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   or something and then you plug in your USB device.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   It doesn't currently work the iPhone, but it works with your iPod
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.120]   or PSP stuff like that and it will convert whatever is playing
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   on that DVD player straight to your USB device.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   - So it puts it right on the iPod?
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   - Yeah, and it's not like handbrake where it takes so long and it--
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   - It's pretty quick.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   - Yeah, it's pretty quick.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   - How old are you?
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   - Handbrake.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   - You're using handbrake already?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   - I think he's going to be on a laptop wearing a number pretty soon.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   - I think four very good.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   What kind of bit rate are you getting with that?
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   - I have no clue.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   - Kid, just make up a number like we do.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   - It doesn't matter.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   They go buy it.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   - Say 256 bit per second bit rate.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   - 256 bit per second bit rate?
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.120]   - Holy crap, that's impressive.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   - That's really amazing.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   - That's a heck of a bit rate.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   - Wow, I record.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   That's a-- that's a--
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   - It's a very lossy algorithm.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   - We should be on this show.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   How do you know this?
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   - However, it's a very lossy algorithm.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   - It's a lossy algorithm?
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   - Oh, well, no, no, no.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   - Well, there you go.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   - You'll go far, kid.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   - So Grant, how old are you?
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   - 10.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   - 10, I'm actually not.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   - I'm actually not from San Francisco.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   I'm from Seattle.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   - Yeah?
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   - I have a house in Gig Harbor.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   - Cool.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   - And by the way, I have shoes on with you too.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   - Cool.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   - And he has a serious wheel.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.120]   - And go ahead, I'll let you do the joke.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   - No, no, I don't.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   - A ferris wheel in a pony ride too.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   - Yes.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   - Come to my house in Gig Harbor.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   He's been trying to get us all to go there.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   Greg, I would stay away, well away.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   - Yeah, Leo, I knew what you were talking about with the
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.120]   jiggly icons, because I just upgraded last night.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   - Yeah, so.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.120]   - All right, everybody, jiggle.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   - I do this.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   Jiggly icons.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   - Ooh, yeah, Greg's jiggly icons.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   I thought you were waving at me.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   Five minutes.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   Is Dane golden in the audience?
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   Is Dane, are you here?
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   Because he's got the ad copy that I need to read.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   Oh, great.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   He stole my ad copy.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   Dane, anywhere?
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   Huh?
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   Yeah, well, we got to do an audible spot.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   We also have to do an iStock photo spot, and he has my ad copy.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   - Oh, wait a minute.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   Here comes the pod track to the rescue.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   - Oh, good.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   Here comes Mr. Montgomery, who represents the all the
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   Twitter podcast, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.120]   exist if it were for Mark McCrory.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   - We bring our own ad guys, everybody.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   - We're gonna have his ones off getting those ad sales, and
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   he's the guy who brought an iStock photo.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.120]   What is it, Mark?
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   - 20% off.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   - 20% off, all right.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   He's also bringing us a better deal.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   Now, you do know about iStock photo.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   I first found out about iStock photo when I was using Vox, the
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   blogging platform, and you could start adding pictures to your
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   blogs from iStock photos, stock photos.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   And I really think if you're doing a blog, having an image in
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   there really makes a big difference.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   iStock photo is the world's highest volume image market, both
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   for people who need images, designers, bloggers, managers,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   looking for great images, not just images video too on a
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   budget, but also for photographers or video artists who want to
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   share their work and are looking for a community and getting paid.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.120]   Did you know that buyers download an image from iStock photo every
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   1.4 seconds?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   iStock photos, an amazing marketplace with great image
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   quality, more than a two and a half million images, 60,000
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   videos, and there are 30,000 more added every week.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   So if you're a photographer and you've thought about doing
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.120]   stock photos, this is the way to go.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.120]   It's a profitable social network.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120]   You get paid.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   There's a great revenue share.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   You make up to 40% from every image that you put up on the
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   website.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   In fact, there are people who make a living off iStock photo do
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   very well on iStock photo.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   If you want to find out more about iStock photo, if you either
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   want to get an image or you want to find out more about putting
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   your images up there, may I suggest a visit to iStock photo.com/twitstock
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   who created a special page, iStock photo.com/twitstock.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   If you register there using the promo code TWITSTOCK 20% off
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   your first purchase, which could sound like a lot, if you're
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   going to do that by a bunch of images, because the image is
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   actually the lowest dollar for web use, video clips as low as
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   $10, so buy a bunch so that you'll get more out of your 20%.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   I have to say, when we do for our podcast, for some of the
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   opens for our podcast, for almost everything that we do, the
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.120]   first place we look for content is iStock photo.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.120]   It is a great resource that we actually use over and over
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.120]   and over because we're cheap.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.120]   I use the crap out of iStock photo.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   Do you? I have a blog or what?
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   I did a presentation yesterday that I was able to finish
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   creating yesterday, and I spent from 4am until about 11 o'clock
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.120]   yesterday, I was on iStock photo almost the whole time.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   My tip to you is to do this, if you do a lot of stuff with iStock photo,
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   create light boxes for all of your different projects, and
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   whenever you're surfing around on the site and you find stuff you
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   like, even if you don't need it yet, it's park it somewhere so you'll
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   get it later, and you end up saving time.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.120]   iStock photo, I'm not compensated, but I really do like.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   You are compensated.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.120]   My productivity.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   iStock photo.com/twitsdoc, we thank them for their
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   support. They made Mac break weekly possible this week at
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   a Mac world expo, so we thank them very much for their support.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.120]   And thank you Mark McCrory for this fine PC laptop.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   We'll be burning this a little later on on the show.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   Acer, huh? You like that.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   Looks like Windows XP. It's called a Mac world, Mark.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   Mac world.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   I got one Leo.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   It's my--
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.120]   Yes, sir.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Now, I know about every month or so one of us chooses one
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   password as our application of the week.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   I really like one password a lot, and I'm kind of covering something
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   that will also be on Mac break video, but I want to share something that's kind of cool.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   They're adding-- so you've got your iPhone, right?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   You got your one password account on your Mac.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   You've got your 28 character mixed case symbols plus numbers password, and if you're like me
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   and you're holding an 11 week old child while you try to enter your 28 character--
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   You can't do it.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   --where you can't do it.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   The good news is that they're now announcing-- I thought this was really cool.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   They're going to have a service where they will actually host your files for you.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   Over HTTPS, you get a JavaScript that is going to enable you to, while you're on a site,
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   click a button.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.120]   It's going to go out and securely grab your passwords per site and enter it in on your iPhone,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   and it all gets synced up without having to worry about it.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   They're really doing a great job.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   Which is-- I mean, if you start using this app, you get out of that stupid habit of always using the same
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   passwords, your hamburger helper passwords.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   This will help you generate a ridiculously complicated password and then remember it for you.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   I think it's a terrific product.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   They're good people, and having the ability to deal on an iPhone is just huge for me.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   Let's hear from the audience.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.120]   You shouted out.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   What was your pick?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   Anything that you saw?
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   Shout it out.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   What is it?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   Nido?
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   Vino.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   What is Bino?
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   I think Bino helps you--
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   I've used Bino extensively in the past.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.120]   That's a trusted product, I believe.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   You eat that before you go to Mexican.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.120]   Oh, Bento.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   Not Bino.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   Bento.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   Oh, they do different things with food.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   Yes.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   It's a new FireMaker program.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   It's really just a simple database.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.120]   I was very impressed that it immediately picks up iKow.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   It's very iWorky.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.120]   Yeah, and I thought you might like it, Merlin, because it does look like a kind of organizational
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120]   tool.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   You know, I haven't spent much time with it.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.120]   We got one in our speaker bag that Scott keeps talking about, and it looks like a really neat
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.120]   kind of like, what the database for the rest of us.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   Yeah, very simple.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   I like that.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   I used to be a huge FileMaker pro fan back in the day.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   Oh, God, I used FileMaker pro all the time.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   I made some really unpleasant looking database.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   Me too, FileMaker pro.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   Lime green gorgeous.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   Very complicated.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   Chris Breen, you look like you got something on your mind.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   Just my hair.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   Just that's normal.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   Just my hair.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   Any other picks?
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   Let's hear it.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.120]   Shout it out.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   Apple TV.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.120]   Everybody likes the new Apple TV too.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   Are we happy about that?
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   That's great.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.120]   I want to see that.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.120]   I really want to see that take off because I love Apple TV.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   It's just the same Apple TV.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.120]   But better.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.120]   But better.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.120]   Just a software update.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.120]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   Free software.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   Free software.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   You can't say no to that.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.120]   It's too weak because I tried it last night.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   I know.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   I've been sitting there reloading.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   Yeah, me too.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   Update, update, update.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.040]   The best copy you can give it is that so many people who bought like some sort of brand
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   new HD hardware who unplugged their Apple TV to make room for it might finally after
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.840]   five or six months plug their Apple TVs back in.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   That's excitement.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   Andy, besides watching bad Italian opera on your iPhone.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.520]   It's Diana Domrau for God's sake.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.320]   Is he a man or you not a man?
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.480]   I don't watch opera on my iPhone.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.440]   Do you have any, do you have any audible books on there that you'd like to recommend?
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.080]   Anything you've been listening to lately.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.480]   What are you listening to now?
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   Right.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   Okay.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   I don't have any audible picks.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.080]   I'm going to say go to Amazon.com.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.480]   Look for, do a search for Diana Domrau.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   The AMRAU.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   How long?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   The broil opera house production of the magic flute.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   You will.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   That's an magic flute.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   It will change your entire attitude towards opera.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   I got one.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   I got one.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.400]   Scott was telling us, Scott saw production of the magic flute recently.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   That was a different one.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   Oh, no.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   I think they on the ood fla.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   I have a pick.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.200]   My daughter's in the audience.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   Yes, sir.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   I have a pick.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Yes, sir.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   I have a pick.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   You have a pick.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.160]   I downloaded a great science fiction book because I'm a science fiction fan.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   Me too, yeah.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.000]   That I read years ago, I won't say how long ago because it was certainly a longer ago
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.680]   than our young friend has been around who was up on this date.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.040]   I wanted to hear it as an audible book because I wanted something just to keep my mind busy.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.520]   It's a book by Frank Herbert.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.800]   It's a great thing called "Dune."
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.720]   They have a dramatization, isn't it?
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   It is.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   It's one of the best, in my opinion, audible books I've heard.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.600]   It makes Dune come to life.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.800]   Even if you've read Frank's work, if you've read the trilogy, whatever, if you're going
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.520]   to use your free Macbreak weekly audible pick, this might be one to apply it to because I
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.120]   have to tell you, I can still hear it.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   It is that good.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.440]   Dune is a wonderful choice.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.720]   Scott, would you like to clarify for those of us who are adult survivors of the Dune
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.160]   movie "Sing It As A Kid?"
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   Oh, God, no.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.880]   See, that's the only reason why I have not read those books.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   Put that out of your mind.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.720]   That's got nothing to do with the book.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   It was awful.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   That's the best recommendation to give the book.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.880]   But does it still have the big floaty guy in the tank?
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   No, no.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Forget him.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   He's good.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   What about Linda Hunt?
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   Is Linda Hunt a month?
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   Not in this.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   It is about the spice.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   The spice.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   The spice.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   The spice is the feature.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   You did it.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   You had to get him early, that was good.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   He's the kid.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   That's the kid.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   I went to school with some Benny Jeseritz.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   Did you?
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   Yeah, it was a Catholic school.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   They're tough.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   They're God's Marines.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   They're tough, but they're fair.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   And they'll just read your mind and just slap that.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   So our Audible Pick of the Week is Dune.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   I highly agree with you.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   That's my favorite.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.240]   Really well done dramatization.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.480]   Not just a straight read.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.200]   It is one of 45,000 plus titles you can get at audible.com.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.680]   And you can get it for free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   I know we've turned.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.880]   How many of you have we turned on audiobooks from audible.com?
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   Do you love them?
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   Aren't they great?
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   Isn't it?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.880]   It's amazing.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.360]   If you like podcasts, you will love audiobooks.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.560]   It's a great way to pass time.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.160]   Please keep listening to the podcast, but you might want to add audiobooks to your repat
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   wow.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   And it's audible.com/macbreak.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.080]   All right.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.000]   Any other business we want to take care of before we wrap this up?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.200]   This is actually just a reminder for people here that we're doing more tomorrow.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   There's lots more going on.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.120]   In fact, if you're listening to this now, come to Macworld Expo tomorrow.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.920]   We're going to be doing Twitter 2PM.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.560]   Twitter 2PM, I think there's the-- we are doing more training about podcasting in the
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   morning.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560]   So we're going to be talking about audio production.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   Lots of stuff.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.200]   And the first thing in the morning, like 10 AM, so you have to kind of jiggle your head
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.800]   a little bit and then get there.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:04.960]   And then at 11 o'clock till about 12.30, we'll be doing-- talking about video production.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.320]   And then at 2 o'clock we have Twitch.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.000]   And then we have something else right after that.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   So there's two more podcasts.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.720]   And don't forget that we've got a great conference.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.320]   If you have a conference badge, Scott Born has put together an amazing conference.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.640]   If you guys want to hear more of Leo at 11 o'clock, 11 o'clock tomorrow morning in room
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   2014.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   Would you guys relax?
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.520]   He's taking pictures of Chris's hair from behind.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   Okay.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   And I don't think--
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.560]   This is-- I think it's like a beetle nut.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.920]   You guys out there-- I don't know if you can see how luxurious it is.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.800]   It's a textured kind of-- It looks like they might have to fortify the pen to keep this
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   thing in.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   And Chris's hair grotto.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.280]   No, no, I've got the Purell in the hair.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.240]   So afterwards you'd like to come up and touch it.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   It's also antibiotic.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   That's excellent.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.440]   Anyway, room 2014 from 9 to 5 tomorrow all about podcasting.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.280]   Leo is speaking with the keynote at 11.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:59.040]   I also want to mention that all of you are welcome to follow Lee and I who have to leave
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.560]   in just a minute because we're on stage over at Gillian's 6 to 8 PM.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.000]   The Mac podcaster meet up.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.280]   It's free if you got a badge.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   Lee, come on.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   Patrick Norton's going to be there.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   He told me he's going to come by.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   8 to midnight.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   I will walk over with you.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   8 to midnight.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   He'll probably be there.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   So we got him.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.120]   Chris, you're back.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   Is he going?
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.320]   Annie, would you come with us?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.480]   I will come with you.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.360]   If you're not going to watch the Macado, you could come with us.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   It's not the Macado.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   It's not the Macado.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   I believe it.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   I believe it.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.200]   Jack on plus or inspection if you're familiar with the works of Gilbert in Sullivan, you'll
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   fly them.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   Exactly.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   Liven.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.520]   Guys, guys, I'm on 93 minutes.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.120]   It's asleep, but I will stop by then.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   Oh, that's good.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   My name is Anthony.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   Knock on.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   I watch the not bar.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.040]   Do you get new hats all the time, or is this just the same hat over and over again?
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.880]   It's like Schroeder's bus of Beethoven.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.560]   He's got nine of the clauses, so when it gets broken, he gets better.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.200]   I have about seven or eight of these in the closet.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   They're all the same.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.360]   If I ever have to shop for another hat, I'll be three months out of my life.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.360]   I'll never get back.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.720]   I want to thank very much, Annie and Aco, for coming by a 93 minutes asleep.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.360]   Did your game show go well?
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   Game show went well.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.040]   We got rid of lots and lots of expensive stuff.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.080]   Yes, I love it.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.360]   You can catch them in the Chicago Sun times or in the colossal ways to bandwidth soon
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.680]   to become the brand new.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   It's out, baby.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.720]   It's the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   Yes.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   It's Annie and Aco.com.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.440]   It's a mission from God now.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.920]   It's not wasting your time and the written resources is now a holy thing.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.160]   The Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Thank you, Annie and Aco.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   It's great to see you in person.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   Always a slice.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.600]   Thanks to Alex Lindsey who put this all together.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.800]   Wouldn't be here without him.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.360]   He did the podcast studio and the great Pixelcore.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.000]   He's a wonderful fella.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.600]   Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.tv for the podcasts.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   That's it.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   Thank you.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   He's probably exhausted.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.040]   Scott, you're just beginning your day because tomorrow we've got that whole day long conference
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   on podcasting.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.240]   Scott Born is of course from Padango.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.200]   He's the guy behind ApplephoneShow.com, the great girls gone geek.tv.tv and a lot of other
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   wonderful podcasts.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.080]   He's really the podcast king now, the daddy of podcasts.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.800]   The Mac Daddy, Chris Breen, the Buffant of all knowledge, there's a halo around his head
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.200]   and it's his hair.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.680]   He is a catch him in Macworld Magazine and of course look for him in bookstores everywhere.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.000]   He's written some great books, including his newest iPhone.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.840]   We've got two iPhone books here.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   That's great.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.240]   One from Chris, one from Andy.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   Yes we do.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.880]   And finally, Merlin Mann from 43folders.com who is a daddy in his own right with his new
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.880]   baby Eleanor.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.640]   You have pictures on the iPhone you can share with.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   He was on the iPhone.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   She came to my talk yesterday.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   Oh, I heard that.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.400]   Somebody said they saw her.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.720]   She slept a lot in Pinch the Loaf but she looked pretty happy for most of it.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   Was that before or after the Loaf?
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.840]   I think she might have made a couple.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   Alright.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.440]   Hey, we thank you all for being here.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.640]   We hope we'll see you online at Twit.tv.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   Thanks for coming.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.640]   Another Mac break is broke.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   Bye-bye everybody.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   [Applause]
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   [Music]
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   [Music]
