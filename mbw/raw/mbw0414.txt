[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.680]   Macs, iOS, that kind of thing.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.640]   Here he is, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.760]   How long have you been doing this show, Andy?
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.760]   Years.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.880]   -ly, 2006? -Wow.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   Since before Justin TV.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840]   Yes, when Justin TV was just like an eight track
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.520]   that you plugged in and every show would start in the middle
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240]   and then end like 10 minutes into the next show.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.600]   Renee Richie on their hand is a new beef, virtual new baby.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   You've only been here a year.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   Yeah, it'll be two years in October, I think.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   Two years in October.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.480]   Nice to have you from imore.com.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.560]   And the reason I'm feeling a little nostalgic
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   is because we got just as I came in the door.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.040]   We got word that Justin.tv has shuttered.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.320]   Justin had renamed itself.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.240]   I didn't even know this in February to twitch.tv.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.640]   They found a twitch, the gaming network.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.960]   And of course, the rumor is, I don't know if Google's
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.640]   confirmed it or not, that Google's going to buy twitch.tv
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   for a billion dollars.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.680]   -You mean billion dollars?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.480]   And so--
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.360]   And that includes all the people and assets of Justin.tv,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.120]   so I guess the feeling is, well, screw it.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.440]   Why should we go to work tomorrow?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.080]   It's like that.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.840]   I like Dave Chappelle's show where he kicks the shelf
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   onto his old boss.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   Why should we come in?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.640]   We're brilliant.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.560]   We're rich.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   I'm rich.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.120]   I love that attitude.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   I only wish there'd been some sort of letter or press
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.280]   conference that said, as you have heard,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.360]   another other online journals, I was just bought out
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   by Google for $920 million, leaving me personally
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.960]   with a figure wealth of $12 million.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.920]   Guess if I--
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.720]   This is the point which I would say I look forward
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.200]   to working closely with the new Google team, but--
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.160]   [SINGING]
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   And they say, if you want to continue to broadcast,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.800]   of course, you can create a twitch.tv account,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.040]   but be warned, not Mac break weekly.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.880]   Anybody doesn't do video game content is not welcome here.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   That's fine.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   I mean, we used Justin-- we used in the past as Justin TV,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.760]   but we currently are also on Ustream and BitGravity
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.840]   and FlowSoft.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.800]   And there are others, so there's choices.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   That's good.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   The internet goes on.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.000]   But they really did just drop the mic
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.160]   and they just walked off stage.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.800]   Because usually, there's a period of, OK,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.840]   we're going to give you a week to get your stuff or something.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   This is like, bam, we're out of here.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.760]   They literally didn't come to work this morning.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.520]   I always wonder about what we don't know about the news,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.200]   whether it was-- no, you can't give people time to do X
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.800]   because we have to put in Y.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.520]   Yeah, it may be.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.600]   But right.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.240]   But you do worry about all the people who
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.760]   might still have content there that is now OK.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.480]   I actually deleted the government of that hard drive
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   because I thought that I'd always have an archive of everything
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.680]   I did, but guess not.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.880]   We used it for live streaming.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.440]   We did not use it for archiving.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.240]   So it's just one of the three or four things
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.800]   we used to stream live.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.240]   So it's not a huge deal for us.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.520]   But it's still-- I have to feel like people who used it
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.920]   as their archive, I guess Chad did.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.440]   It's kind of like, whoa.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.000]   See ya.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.440]   Kind of a shocker.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.240]   Anyway, thought I'd just mention that
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.440]   since we-- the first bit of news when I came in today.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.600]   There is another bit of news that just broke an hour ago.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   Apple's event for the iPhone, according to code red,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.480]   John Patchekowski, is September 9th.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.760]   Incredible rumor, Renee Ritt?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.800]   You're our rumor, uh, veteran.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.440]   So back in January, I wrote a piece called Apple
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.960]   Release Day Roulette, where I said the most likely date
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.440]   for the iPhone would be September 9th.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.000]   You named it!
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.360]   So I mean, that is just because for the third year in a row,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.160]   Apple has used the exact same week for this event.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.480]   So I think that-- everything looks like it is lined up for that.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.360]   And John has an excellent reputation,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.000]   and it makes a lot of sense to do it that week
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.920]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.960]   Sure.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.120]   The real question is how soon after that
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   will the putative new iPhone be available?
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.040]   In 10 days, if they hold a pattern.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.480]   So in the 19--
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.720]   Yeah, if they hold a pattern.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.040]   And then we've heard some rumors that they might not.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.440]   Incredible.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.800]   4.7 sounds done.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   The 5.5 sounds much more iffy.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.000]   I think that limiting factor is going to be iOS 8.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.960]   When do they feel confident about shipping it?
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.080]   And remember that we haven't-- we've seen--
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.320]   we've seen a nice velocity of developer betas,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.800]   but we-- but still, as soon as we start
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.640]   seeing more velocity about finished stuff,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.760]   where a lot of infrastructure is going to be back in place,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.240]   that's when that's going to look about more
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.800]   like a day and date release than a--
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.920]   hi, we're announcing it.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.000]   And it's going to be shipping with iOS 7,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.800]   because it's so good.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.200]   We want to give people another six weeks to enjoy it.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.560]   beta 5 of iOS 8 did come out a couple of days ago.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   Yep.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.400]   And are there big differences?
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   Is it-- I am not using it.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.960]   And I--
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's got a few UI tweaks.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.400]   It does some things-- it's not a major difference.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.240]   It fixed a lot of issues that I had with the previous beta.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.480]   One of the most interesting things
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.280]   is all that security stuff that we were talking about,
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   all the back door stuff.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   Apple has begun to close that down in iOS 8 beta 5.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.240]   OK.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.320]   So like peak app and stuff is no longer as easily accessible.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.480]   All the wireless accessible, at least stuff, has been--
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.800]   Yeah, Jonathan Shudarski, who of course
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.840]   was the base player who revealed this information
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.360]   in his Hopex, a talk identifying back door attack points
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.520]   and surveillance mechanisms in iOS devices,
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.800]   blogged at a number of high value forensic services
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.240]   I'd outlined have now been disabled,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.760]   including that packet sniffer that he was saying,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   why 600 million iOS devices have a packet sniffer built in?
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.680]   Well, maybe Apple listened.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.480]   Apple's fixes are still a work in progress, Shudarski writes,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.240]   not all of my security concerns have been addressed yet,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.360]   but it does show Apple cares about the security of their product
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   and likely wants to prevent their APIs from being abused
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   by malicious hackers or government.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   Which goes to the intent stuff, because there was some debate
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.400]   about whether Apple did it on purpose or not.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.000]   And this shows that they're fixing it when they learn about it.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.200]   Wait a minute now though, it's not like they didn't learn about it.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   They're fixing it when we learned about it.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   They knew about it.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.280]   They didn't realize it was as accessible as it was to people outside
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.800]   of the intended purpose.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   Right.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.120]   They hadn't really thought about it,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.600]   and they didn't realize it could be used in malicious ways.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.920]   And it is a really complex system,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.600]   and it's actually possible for things to have been put in years ago
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.360]   and then sort of forgotten about, not abandoned,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.960]   but for people to not think, "Oh, that's right.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   We were supposed to do something about that a few years ago."
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.760]   The fact that they turned this around so quickly indicates
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.040]   that it was more of...
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.400]   They didn't have to go up and down.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.920]   It didn't...
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.640]   Removing these things didn't cause anything else to break,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.320]   either inside the phone or in Apple's process.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.280]   So that tends to indicate that this is something
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.440]   they probably would have gotten around to removing
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.560]   if they had ever gotten down to that low on the to-do list
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.880]   before launching an operating system.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.240]   And a little bit of inside baseball,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.480]   but there's a couple of teams at Apple
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.360]   that have the ability to take your code away from you
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.880]   and fix it, and the security audit team is one of those teams.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   So they could have gone over,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   gone across to one infinite loop and said, "Hey, give me that.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   Give me that.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Bam!"
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.360]   "Hey, that's cool.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.280]   You know what? That's a good..."
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.320]   Is that a typical thing?
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.760]   Is that how companies often operate?
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.840]   That sounds like a...
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.320]   They have several teams that do different things,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.160]   and security and performance are both teams that can come in
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.840]   and make sure stuff is fixed.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.240]   Love that.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.080]   So battery life, security, all that kind of stuff
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.400]   is super high priority.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.120]   They have the ban hammer.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.000]   They can go in there and they got the rule, the right,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.080]   to do anything they want.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.920]   I like that.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   I think more companies should have that.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.520]   That's one of the reasons why the new campus is a big ring
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.400]   so that when people screw up like that, they can say,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   "All right, take a lap.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.960]   Take a lap.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.560]   Drop and give me 20."
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.760]   I thought it was so they couldn't run away.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.960]   You go that way, you go that way.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   We'll get him in the middle.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   That's a good.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.200]   All right.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.680]   So really not a big surprise that September 9th,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.720]   that's exactly the date you thought in January.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.520]   So credible, that's a credible rumor.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.320]   And you both feel that if iOS 8 is ready,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.280]   we'll see those phones within 10 days.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.600]   Typically, what the events Tuesday,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.160]   and then they release it a week from Friday.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   Is that how it works?
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.120]   Yeah, iOS comes out, I think usually the Wednesday before,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.960]   and then the phone comes out the Friday.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.680]   iOS 8 will work on all iPhones down to what?
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   Or S.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.800]   It will work on the 4S.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   Okay.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.640]   So if you have a 4 or lower, you're out.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.880]   And that's the thing that's so damaging to Apple right now,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.520]   and you can see it in recent articles about Apple deliberately sabotaging devices,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.920]   is that if they don't make it backwards compatible,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   people think that they're withholding features,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   so you have to upgrade.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   And if they do, and it's designed for faster running devices,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.960]   and you don't have a great experience,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.760]   they think they're sabotaging your phone so that your 4S, the blind.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   It can't win.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   No.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   It's not sabotage.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   It does.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   iOS 7 and iOS 8, though, do produce real stumbling blocks
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.240]   that previous versions didn't have,
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.080]   because now there are so many apps that I rely on every day on my iPad
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.240]   and on my iPhone, where they are now just iOS 7 only.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.440]   They're never going to run properly on iOS 6.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.560]   I have to keep the old ones.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   And now there's new infrastructure that iOS 8 takes advantage of.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.960]   That if I've upgraded my Mac to Yosemite,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.480]   that I'm going to have to have this new phone with this new operating system.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.200]   So I can understand the pain point.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.760]   I mean, I really think that Apple's only social contract with its users
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   is to make a useful phone for the life of the contract you're under for that phone.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.360]   And so if you bought a 4S new while it was the hot phone, you got two years.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.160]   OK.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.520]   There's an article in Digital Trends
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.720]   to that effect.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.800]   Dear conspiracy nuts, Apple doesn't cripple your old iPhone.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.120]   Time does.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.800]   And perception.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   I mean, when you see a new iPhone and it's so powerful and moving,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.400]   that your sense of velocity is like when you get off a highway
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.160]   and suddenly the streets seem very slow, it's the same kind of feeling.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.040]   But nonetheless, let's give some credit to people
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.600]   for wanting to get more than a couple of years out of a fight.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.080]   I mean, it would be really terrible if Apple were to do this sort of thing
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.960]   with desktop operating system releases, where I really think you have a right
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.760]   to expect a new Mac to be good for at least five or six years.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.160]   And even if when you're out of service for the most recent operating system,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   you should also have the ability to at least have a current patched version
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.080]   available for download wherever you want to get it.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   So if this becomes a trend of Apple's only supporting phones from two years out,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.360]   that would be a very bad trend.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.120]   But there's so much going on, especially with iOS 7 and iOS 8,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.040]   that they can't really be backwards compatible as far back as anybody would like.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.960]   It's not surprising that people think that Apple may also have some commercial
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.000]   interest in getting you to buy a new phone.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.200]   It's possible.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.280]   They are the contrast.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.120]   There's Android to the same.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.560]   I mean, I think it's the contrast is anti.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.320]   Let me flip a coin here.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.560]   OK, go ahead, Renee Rich.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.800]   I would say, what would you say?
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920]   No, I was going to say that the actual contrast is a lot of people complain
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.240]   that Android doesn't get updates as fast,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.720]   depending on the level of manufacturer customization.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.160]   But you still have exactly the phone you bought for two or three years.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   And perceptively, that phone still works for you the way it was when you bought it.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.120]   So it's funny that Apple provides these updates, but at the same time,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.640]   some people would rather maybe they didn't.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.240]   Oh, I was going to say, I think there's something to the idea that part of Apple's success
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.120]   is in making you want the next thing.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.920]   This is not for they don't sell candy bar phones to people who are going to say,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.160]   I have five things I need to do with this phone.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.200]   It does eight things.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.640]   I'm three up on the deal.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.800]   I feel as though I've come away from this a winner.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.640]   They are people who are going to say, even though the difference between the four and the four
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.280]   S and the five, we're not really epic shattering changes.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.080]   You really have to go to the five S when you talk about hardware that almost redefined
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.280]   what an iPhone is.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.640]   So if you're going from the four to the four S to the five, a lot of Apple's ability to move
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.400]   those phones is ability to convince someone.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.000]   I know that you have the four S.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I know that you're really happy with the four S, but oh my God, the five.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.880]   You are going to think that that phone that is this much not as tall that you got your pocket
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.520]   right now.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.320]   Oh, what a piece of crap because when you get the screen, that's this tall.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.880]   Wow, you know that you're living in the 24.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.600]   I mean, it's a lot of it is trying to get people to think that let me tell you about the chamfered
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.520]   edges. Let me tell you about the process of assembly and how we've created this brand
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.560]   new architecture to slim down. It's part of the it's part of the seduction of, oh, but this one is new
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.320]   and it is lovely. I think that's maybe an advantage of like other models of phone.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.160]   They're a little bit ugly, so you kind of only appreciate them for what they actually do for your
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.720]   life. You never get into a get into a golem relationship with any Samsung phone.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.280]   That's for sure.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.400]   I'll recuse myself in this conversation since I put I probably change funds every few months.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.600]   So I don't know what it's like to have an old phone.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.160]   See, you didn't keep your phone in your shirt pocket, but you use the bathroom.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.920]   You wouldn't have to go through phones every three months.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.520]   No, I go through funds every three months because I always want to be trying them out so I can
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.680]   talk about them. So I have to. But it is the case that if iPhone four is five years old now,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.560]   on the other hand, a five year old computer, it would, I think a lot of people would be
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.800]   pissed off if they felt like they couldn't use a five year old computer.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   And Apple kept selling the iPhone four until last year and they still sell it in China, India.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.440]   So it doesn't have to be five years old. It could be brand new.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.120]   Yeah. And it's with very low amounts of memory, which is further compounds the problem.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.160]   And some people in the chatroom are saying, just let people run older versions of the software.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.840]   And that again is a trade off because Apple touts how uniform their platform is that I think
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.960]   some ridiculous number over 90% of people are on iOS seven and their security, music and security
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.440]   patch everybody all at once. So yes, they could let people run older versions of software or they
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.360]   could prioritize updates and security. But there's always a tension between those things as well.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.120]   I mean, not only that, but developers will tell you exactly how expensive it is to maintain old
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   software. It's not just simply, we'll leave it up on the server. Maintaining it and supporting it
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.480]   is just such a time suck for such little benefit. You're basically telling Apple we want to devote
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   besides your time and labor force to maintaining people who really should just go to a phone store
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.840]   and buy a new phone at this point, or as far as their concern. Is this also a testament to the fact
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:18.720]   that unlike PCs, phone cell phones are in rapid development cycles. I mean, even in the early
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.160]   days of PCs, you wouldn't have to buy a PC every two years. I think it also reflects how well made
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.600]   the iPhone is. I mean, there are very few day to day carry plastic phones that I have that will last
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.280]   a couple of years. Whereas, I mean, I still have my original iPhone and I've carried it every day
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.960]   for three years, dropped it a few times, no problem. And even today it fires up just fine, running that
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:49.840]   Fisher price version of iOS. But I think by the time of Samsung or some of the other HTC phones
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:57.600]   become two or three years old, it's starting to look like something that you might have Ebola in
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.240]   and you might actually not want to be using on a day to day basis.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   Can Apple solve this problem by offering low price or cheap old, you know, one year old or two year
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   old phones make a five be zero dollars and then people will upgrade. Wouldn't that solve it?
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.360]   They sort of do it. I mean, the five C is their $100 phone and the four S is their $0 phone and
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.040]   this year, the five whatever the five C version is, they'll have a $0 $100 $200 phone. So you could
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   be using a more you could trade up to a less expensive phone. In more things, if you don't mind,
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.920]   if you don't mind being a surf for another two years.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.160]   I wonder if Apple's even kind of given up on trying to attack those other markets the way that
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.720]   other manufacturers can do because the reason people we make fun of cheap phones, but that's
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   really what a lot of people really want to buy in certain parts of the world. And Apple just is
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.240]   Apple is about as well set up to make a $49 $39 phone as GM is to design a car that they're going to
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.800]   sell 20,000 copies of that's just not the way they run their business. And so it's just going to
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.320]   be a little elitist though. I mean, well, not elitist. It's what they it's what they do really well.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.200]   I really do like the the the auto maker comparison that there are shops that are really good at hand
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.840]   they can they can hand make a thousand cars a year. And that's what they're optimized for.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.880]   That's what they make really, really well. And that's one of the reasons why they have to sell
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   these cars for half a million dollars, even a million dollars, because that's the only way you
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.440]   can hand make a car and make a profit of it. And part of it is selling or overselling the style,
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.600]   selling or overselling the engineering and giving people whole experience. But then there's needs
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.360]   to be GM, there needs to be Toyota, these these people who can punch out $22,000 cars at the rate
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:43.520]   of one every five seconds. And it's not so much that Toyota is more pro-letarian than Bugatti.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.760]   It's just that this is the business that this is the machinery that they set up to produce something
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.240]   that they want to make. I just think that if Apple were to ever make a $49 phone, I mean,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.880]   a legitimate sticker price is $49 all over the world brand new phone. That would be such a
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.600]   revolution for Apple that they the hover car has to be about a week coming after that.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   I wonder if the cost of high-end phones is dropping though. I mean, I look at this.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.360]   This is the OnePlus one, which is in every respect to high-end phone, three gigs of RAM. It's the
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:20.240]   Snapdragon 801, the fastest Qualcomm processor. It's a 1080p five and a half inch screen.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.560]   It's 20 hours battery life, 13 megapixel camera. I mean, it's got all the specs and it sells for
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:35.760]   $300 for 16 gigs and $350 for 64 gigs unlocked out the door. Couldn't Apple do something like?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.440]   I mean, it seems to me this if they can if Apple, OnePlus one can do this,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.520]   we're going to start seeing more of these, right? It's a different business. Apple is
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.040]   entirely based on hardware sales, everything that they do, there's one profit and loss across
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.200]   the entire company. When you buy an iPhone, you're not just paying for the atoms, the way that you
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.160]   are for other manufacturers who maybe use Android or don't have their own retail store or don't
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   provide something like AppleCare or don't provide their own operating system. When you're buying
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.840]   an iPhone, you're paying for iOS, you're paying for AppleCare, you're paying for Apple Retail,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.520]   you're paying for all the free apps that Apple makes that go along with that. It's an entire,
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.600]   it really sounds stupid, but it really is the entire ecosystem that you're paying for.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.400]   You're providing Apple with enough money that they can keep maintaining and building that ecosystem
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.480]   and buying other companies and doing all these things. That's why it's really hard. You can't
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   just take one element of a company like Xiaomi or OnePlus one and try to fit it to an Apple model
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.520]   or vice versa. Those companies are specifically designed almost like the way network companies
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   were to make a commodity product that really is in crisis. It's not commodity hardware.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:42.720]   Maybe they save a little bit on Android, but I mean, is that is the $350 difference? iOS 8?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   iOS 8 and everything else that Apple does. So you don't have a fingerprint reader on here?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.680]   And Apple also doesn't, it's not that they don't believe people should have cheap phones,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.400]   it's just they don't believe that they can do it well, so they stay out of that market. The
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.080]   same way BMW or Mercedes doesn't think that they can make the Honda Accord or the Toyota.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.680]   These are phones, these are not, this is not a Chevy. Yeah, but you got to admit that the iPhone
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.400]   5S was not the first phone that had a built-in fingerprint reader. It was just the first one that
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.320]   really did it well. And that's what you're paying for as for part of the sticker prize.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   Not the ability to source a component and write software and drivers to make it work,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.440]   but the three or four or five years it took to reject ones that didn't work to figure out,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.320]   to give the consumers version six of a piece of hardware, even though this is the first time
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.560]   it's appearing on a new phone. I feel like just the way there's been pressure on Apple,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.000]   by bigger and bigger screens and bigger screen choices, there's going to be downward pressure
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.040]   on prices too, because of, look at the Moto X and the Moto G and the, I mean,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.680]   they weren't in computers though really. I mean, everyone kept saying that about the
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.160]   two. That's true. Apple didn't have to respond to that, did they?
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.200]   And there was a lot of a different difference between a Mac, you know, in quality of hardware
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.160]   as well as in software. Well, one of the things with those phones too is a lot of the phones
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.680]   coming out of China right now, and this is part of the reason Lenovo bought Motorola, are not,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.880]   are not up to speed with intellectual property rights, and those phones will become more expensive
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.800]   when they have to start paying the licensing fees that are required to sell into North American
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.200]   to sell. I mean, the next is properly into North American.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.680]   Five is cheap. That's a high end phone. That's not,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.520]   it's subsidized by Google to be that cheap.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.440]   Ah, okay. Yeah. And the other thing is that Apple is not now and never has been and never will be
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.200]   the hog butcher to the world. They can do, they can pursue their style of making high quality
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.960]   hardware because they know that there is a market of people, of people in businesses that
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.880]   can't afford their products, can't afford, don't really appreciate that level of fit and fun
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.680]   or finish, neither do they need it. And that 80% of the market is being covered by other laptop
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.600]   makers. So they can basically skim off the top, the 20% of people or the 15% of people that can
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.760]   afford it, that believe that they're going to be getting that money back in the long run,
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.880]   who do appreciate the way that a MacBook Air is put together versus the way that Windows Ultra
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.840]   Book is put together. So if someone, if an Apple major, major, major fan were to get the
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.640]   uses last Magic Genie wish to say, and I wish that Apple has no more competition and they're the
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.040]   only maker of computers, I really think that five years from now, they would stay, would be making
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.560]   a $500 laptop and they would be making a $39 phone because if they are the only market out there,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.440]   they would finally, they would quickly realize that they can't sell $1,000 laptops to the entire
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.240]   world. They really have to address that part of the market that up to now they just never have
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.760]   needed to bother with. It's kind of funny because Apple has this reputation of being
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.920]   kind of a populist company for the people. Well, they are. I mean, they are no more than the BMW
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.480]   as the company's popular luxury. Well, popular luxury. But there's one really important thing
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.080]   to remember and that is that this is not a new strategy. We've seen the strategy of low margin
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.160]   products of commodity products, even with good specs, play out across the history of consumer
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.120]   electronics. Unfortunately, it's not always sustainable. Sometimes the profit margins get so low that
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.280]   the company's suffering. If you look at who made VCRs or who made DVD players, a lot of those
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.080]   companies don't exist anymore. As a consumer, it's easy to think that the lowest price is in my
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.800]   best interest, but it's really the most sustainable price. Maybe Apple profit margins are ridiculously
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.480]   high. You can go buy Apple stock and get some of that money back if you really believe that.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.760]   But it also allows them to have an incredibly sustainable business over decades. I would like
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.400]   there to be more competition. I think Samsung is doing some of it at the mid tier to high tier
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   brands because it gives me faith that that company will be here to honor my warranties and to make
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.640]   me more great products next year, five years later, 10 years later. I don't know what to make of this,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.040]   but there's a Harvard graduate student, Laura Trucco, who did some research and she found that
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.680]   more people search for iPhone slow on Google right around the same time as Apple launches a new model.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.240]   They explain that at the bottom of the article. They say that it's a lot of it has to do with
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.760]   perception and then people misquote that article to say Apple sabotages phone.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.320]   Right. I don't think that's evidence that Apple sabotages phones, but I think it is accurate. I
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.360]   believe that that's accurate. Who knows what they're looking for? Are they looking for solutions to a
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.280]   slow iPhone or are they trying to see if their iPhone is slow so they can have an excuse to buy
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.160]   the new one? I'm not sure. Or when you notice that when you update software, things will change
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.960]   and then you're more loud. It's like when you buy a certain color car suddenly everybody has
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.400]   a color car. There's a lot of perceptions. It really comes down to motivation. I don't think
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.320]   that Apple sabotages anything, but no, where do they make their money from? They make their money
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.080]   from selling new hardware and therefore they're going to steer everything towards that. I mean,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:39.120]   if you want a service people that are more motivated towards keeping your hardware alive,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:46.000]   that's why you switch from Android to Sanogen mod, which is no free Android of people that
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.560]   have no interest in selling you phones whatsoever. That's how you can get a four year old Android
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.200]   phone running something very, very modern. That's how you can get a laptop that's 10 years old,
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.760]   running not Mac OS and not Windows, but an operating system that's very, very modern. You go you
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.480]   you switch to Linux to people who just want to give you a free operating system and kind of take
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.720]   joy in keeping your stuff alive. But it's it's it's it's it's not correct to try to expect that
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.920]   10 years later you are still going to get you're still going to get the new version of
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.200]   of Mac OS with the new version of iOS on anything. I'm sure they have this discussion in the board room
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.640]   in the at the executive level, right? Because they have to make this decision. I mean,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.680]   they're consciously making an decision not to sell on an expensive phone, for instance.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:39.840]   Go ahead. I was gonna say that usually it's it's their experience that it's it's it really is
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.160]   a bunch of guys who put it on the device and they say this is not an experience an apple level
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   experience. It's the same thing with a focus on price or they're focused on the you the end
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.720]   users experience and they want it they have a certain standard of quality they want the end
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.600]   user to have and it must be like that and that's and that's and that's really I mean I believe that
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.720]   that's kind of what Steve's focus was right like 15 frames per second video is like you can jailbreak
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.240]   and do that but apple is not going to put their name on 15 frames per second video. We're only
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.840]   going to provide it to 30 frames and above and that's what they do for the features and when
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.800]   there's enough features like that I believe that's what they do with the operating system. It just
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.600]   happens that that's convenient for good good convenient like good for business as well like a lot of
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.000]   the new iPhone stuff requires Bluetooth low energy like all the continuity stuff just requires
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.280]   Bluetooth low energy and if you don't have that on the phone you're not going to get all those
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.320]   features you know and then you start making decisions based on how much you're actually going to be
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.520]   able to use it. And I was I was going to ask a question that I'd like both of your opinions on
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:41.440]   do you think that apple has the option of not releasing a new phone in any given calendar year
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.640]   if they were to take this to the resting with with a with a with a we all we all quote this so many
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.200]   times that it seems like it's canon that well apple is not afraid to delay something and not
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.440]   ship a feature until they think it's perfect could they simply say you know what we have a phone
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.760]   that's a little bit better but same case the processors a little bit faster it'll run the new
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   operating system as fast as well as the current model we thought that we just blow your socks off
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.280]   next year and continue to support the five S for another year do they have the option of saying
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.480]   no new iPhone no that would really upset people it upset them when they move the the launch from
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:21.120]   from from June to September. You know I think that people get upset if you know they expect a new
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.920]   phone apple has now locked itself into a yearly release and by the way that's a slower release
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.520]   cycle than any other smartphone manufacturer really right now I would say so well HTC is every
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.800]   year right but Samsung is one every month that's different from like the galaxy yes yeah I'm saying
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.000]   given that the apple really has one phone if they they release one phone a year if you could say
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.720]   the Samsung releases an update to the galaxy s integer once a year but they also do like three
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.280]   or four five or six or seven other so they're certainly way way productive so yearly is about
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.720]   right. I think it's it's actually not a hardware question because when the iPhone 4s took 16 months
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.480]   to come out that wasn't because of the hardware they had the hardware ready that was because iCloud
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.040]   and Siri took them that long to get done and I think you know they could they could probably
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.880]   almost always bump the hardware in some ways even even if it's just a small incremental update they
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.360]   could do they could have that hardware event but if they commit themselves something as big as iCloud
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.680]   again or something as big as Siri and it takes 16 months they no longer have the luxury of
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.800]   pushing it to fall they've already pushed it to fall so that would push it to the next year and
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.160]   not selling something means missing their biggest quarter their holiday quarter where people do
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.120]   want new things which is why they had like new colors on on iPods you know you could have a
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.200]   red iPhone maybe it could be anything that they could do to make that seem like a holiday product
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.880]   but I think it's the hot the software that will that will be the constraint they're not the hot
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:49.520]   but at the same time don't anybody who bought an iPad 3 only to say if I had waited four months
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:54.800]   I would have gotten a retina iPad that was so much better some better memory better everything
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.600]   those people had to have felt pretty minus that apple felt the need to push out a second iPad
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.240]   this year yeah they did it what six or eight months later yeah made and then to September yeah
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:10.960]   not even that long yeah yeah May October uh April October six months sorry any more changes
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.480]   but no that was uh once that was interesting I just dropped a box of toothpicks on the floor
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.680]   I want you to tell me how many toothpicks there are without looking at 137
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   or 30 so definitely 400 or so uh no but I mean that was a case where the the the
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.080]   the chipset in that was just not good enough to sustain that product and you can talk to
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.920]   game developers and everyone about it it was it was harder to use than the iPad 2
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.760]   which you know because their retinus play pulled so much resources out of it it didn't have the
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.400]   lightning connector they could have probably waited and just not released the iPhone the iPad 3
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.280]   but with the iPad 3 on the market I think it was the best of bad decisions to put out the iPad 4
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.960]   faster hmm but why now that I've never heard I've never heard that express before why did they
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.920]   have to put out the iPad 3 as opposed to waiting and making just the use people are expecting one
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.120]   more iPad at one point during the year they knew we all knew that retina was certainly coming and
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   certainly ready given the panelers that we'd seen why did they had they why did they maybe not have
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.920]   an option but not to but to ship a reasonably underpowered version of a much better thing that
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.680]   was going to be happening six months later oh I think they did I think you know if they knew then
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.000]   what they knew now they probably would have just waited and done it in the fall with the
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.160]   iPhone iPad 4 I don't know if they understood the full extent of of the retina tax that they would
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.600]   be paying with that device when they shipped it because you know it's internal testing is way
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   different than a million people hitting that device and if I learned a good lesson from that
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.840]   yeah okay I would agree with learned a good lesson I'd be surprised if they weren't aware
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.800]   that they didn't have the they didn't have a game plan that told them here is when we can we know
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.160]   that we know that this is going to produce some problems we're going to ship this because we do
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.840]   feel this is a very strong solid product but we know when the iPad 4 is going to be ready it's
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.920]   it's it's interesting I'm not I'm not I don't have any conclusions to draw I think that the iPad 3
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.800]   is when we look back 10 years later is going to be an interesting case study in how Apple makes
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.680]   us decisions I did not the antenna to write like the 4s has a the Verizon iPhone 4 at a way better
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.760]   antenna than the iPhone 4 that was just a learned lesson that that cost only and the iPhone 4 I
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.000]   mean I think that that was colored itself that I think that was colored with some of the old
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.960]   Apple arrogance because there's no way that couldn't have known what was good what was going to happen
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.760]   with these things released but it's it's a new Apple and it's as I said I don't I don't draw any
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.640]   conclusions but I do think that when we have access to more information 10 years from now I think
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.360]   that the we will have we'll be able to point to the iPad 3 and learn a lot about how Apple developed
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.200]   hardware at that point only the most hardcore fanboy would ever say Apple doesn't make mistakes
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.760]   they make lots of mistakes oh yeah and I think that that it's fair to say that the three probably
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.040]   well see I have a three I skipped the four because I unlike many did not have a problem did not feel
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.600]   like the free was three was slow it was fine for every day you see we're hard for a game
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   or you did other there was great fine for me so I literally did not upgrade but that was because
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:13.440]   it was a six month time frame it just I think that this is a great given the the multitude of
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.200]   changes that we've seen in Apple over the past year and a half two years I think it's time to
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.000]   make sure that we revisit revisit everything that we think is canonical about how Apple operates
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.640]   and I do think that the oh well Apple will definitely delay so the Apple will not ship something until
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.600]   it's perfect until it fits into their scheme that is certainly a goal I think but I think
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.520]   there's enough counter examples over the past three years to say that at some that at some
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.040]   that they don't ship crap but they're willing to say okay well you know what let's let's ship it
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.120]   let's all get the first good night's sleep we've gotten in eight months and then come back to work
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.320]   on Monday and really attack the the final points of this problem we have in the brick house two
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.920]   exactly diametric views Patrick Delahandy like me said I didn't upgrade from a three to a four
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.600]   because I didn't have the money to spend on yet another iPad so soon Jeff Needle said I went from
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.960]   and oh by the way I'll add another reason I didn't upgrade because I didn't want to get I wanted
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.120]   to keep my 30 pin cables so I didn't want to have to buy all new cables Jeff Needle said I went from
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.800]   the three to the four so I could get lightning that's a fanboy I was so excited about lightning
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.640]   I am immediately six months later I'm getting out I would say fanboys some of us some of us have
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:26.560]   more resources than others well I mean I well it's so it's and that's not an insult whatsoever
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.760]   I mean I I could afford it and I didn't do it on principle for the first for the first time in my
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   life I bought a new Mac book even though I had a perfectly good Mac book uh from the 15th from
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:45.440]   the 15 inch to from 2011 to the 20 to the 13 inch retina and certainly if I did not have some I could
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   justify it by saying oh well there's so many hardware features are tied to the operating system
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.280]   now that I can't test out and I can't benefit from okay well I know that normally I wait for me to
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   spill a bit a beverage into the keyboard and cause sparks to shoot out but yes I will have to work for
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.520]   the first time in my life I'll have two perfectly good working Mac books so I don't I don't insult
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.760]   that but yeah it's it's there are a lot of people that really do have to make that decision that
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.840]   the iPad 3 is for is is a lot of people upgraded from the iPad 1 to the iPad 3 they felt a little
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.560]   bit minus when the iPad 4 came out for five or six months for now but certainly not so minus
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.120]   that they were going to spend another five six seven eight hundred dollars to replace a piece of
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.520]   hardware that was perfectly good that's that was unless you needed better GPU or you needed the
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.000]   extra LTE bands you were fine I bought Sarah the four because we were doing we're doing iPad
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.840]   the day and somebody should have the four and then I wanted to represent those of us who were
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.360]   pissed and I stuck with my brain darn it you'd much rather have the iPad 3 and a spiteful attitude
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.320]   exactly iPad 4 I'd be perfectly happy with Apple holding on to my resistance here we're gonna get a
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.000]   an iPad Air with touch ID and people who bought the iPad Air last year without touch ID you're
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.560]   gonna go I do I want touch ID that badly yeah they're gonna have to they're gonna have to prove
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.480]   they're gonna have to prove that touch IDs well you start using one password with iOS 8 and touch
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.680]   ID and it's I mean Steve Gibson was talking about this last week when you start having the touch
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.560]   ID API and it hooks into everything and right suddenly all your apps are just one thumbprint
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.640]   away I mean do we know yet which apps will do that it does one password announced they're going
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   to do one password is shown the demo and if you're on their beta and you have iOS 8 you can you
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.640]   can use it now and it's it's transformative so yeah my bank does it or or I use last pass but
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.400]   yeah no they're right up that's what I kind of mean it's not really up to Apple demonstrate it
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.680]   it's up to all the developers to demonstrate use besides just unlocking the screen faster
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.040]   and that that is something that demonstrates exactly why when you invest in Apple boy does it pay off
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:43.200]   over the life of that product because touch ID as released in with the iPhone 5s with iOS 7
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.080]   it's nice unlocking the phone it's paying the butt having be able to do it with a touch that's nice
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.680]   but Apple themselves knew that well we're working on extensibility we're working on iOS 8 once we
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.240]   have the ability to let people write third-party software that simply says every time you design
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:05.040]   into anything touch this and it will work that's what gets people to say why to do any other companies
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.240]   make tablets again do they have this feature no so why are they shipping a phone or tablet I don't
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:18.560]   know why let's take a break when we come back the Beats acquisition is final so we'll talk about
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   that Andy and I'll go see her from the Chicago Sun times Renee Richie from imore.com or Talking
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:32.800]   Apple Mac and more. Our show today brought to you by the good people at IT Pro T V an easy
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.920]   entertaining approach to online IT training if you're an IT professional or you want to be an IT
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.840]   professional I'm sure you know the certifications are a big part of getting a job I interviewed Kevin
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.960]   Rose yesterday in triangulation with stun to learn that in high school he got his A+ certification
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.640]   and of course he started working as an IT guy because of it he also has no valid certifications
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.680]   I was I was blown away this you know this is a smart guy and of course there are ways and ways
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.240]   to get your cert you're gonna have to take a test but you're also gonna have to study for it and
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.600]   you can go to a technical college at you know sometimes very great expense you can buy expensive
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:17.280]   study materials but I like the fun easy affordable way it's IT Pro TV if you visit it pro dot tv slash
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.840]   Mac break you can take a look at what they've got they've got free courses so you can get a guided
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.160]   tour sample episodes then you might want to look at all the classes they do have apple classes now
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:36.880]   integration basics for 10.9 management basics 10.9 max service certification OS 10 troubleshooting
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:42.080]   both coming in the fourth quarter so they're they're really expanding their offerings they have of
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:49.200]   course A plus net plus security plus CASP strata they've got the Microsoft certification Cisco
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:54.880]   these new security certs are really cool the ISC square the sscp and the cissp
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:01.200]   they've really I mean and what they do is they do it very much like we did tech tv or we do

[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   showed him how to do it and now they use the same they use a tricaster say microphones in fact if
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.960]   you look at the set it really looks very similar to what we do and that makes it very enjoyable

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:07.920]   apple welcomes beats to the fold the act the approval first was in the EU of the
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.880]   they got us approval last week and they closed the deal beats music and beats electronics now part
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.040]   of the family see when you when you said i never thought i'd see this day i thought you meant
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.000]   a apple official web page with white text on a black background that too because that that
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.480]   shook me to my core that's the beats color scheme right red on black
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.360]   you know one of the things is most interesting i think is the een
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:40.480]   whoa uh something went wrong this is the beats by drape page css error css error let's reload that
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:48.080]   page akemai fail um one of the things that uh has happened already Ian Rogers the ceo of beats
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.920]   has taken over i radio ixens radio which is good because i think it's it's actually a
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.120]   very good thing and it seems like nobody knows about it although apple does claim a fairly large
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.840]   like six million or four million some some big number for a user base because it's part of
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.680]   iTunes it gets it's a blessing in the curse that people who are heavy into iTunes will use it but
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.040]   people who don't use it won't even notice that it's there yeah i wish i wish i could see it broken
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.200]   down between people who actually actively use it the way that they would use spotify and the
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.680]   people who take a look at it launch at once and say why do i want this i've got spotify right like
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.720]   gmail and google plus yeah they're going to keep the beats brand right but they'll start selling
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:33.040]   beats headphones in the apple store and online they'll uh presume start offering beats music
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.960]   in some form or fashion will at some point fold that into what they're doing make it happen because
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.680]   i mean they've been selling beats in apple stores for a while and the beats app is on ios and android
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.040]   and windows phone and i think they said they're going to continue that which means it probably
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.240]   needs to be kept at least somewhat separate at least for those platforms yeah it's possible that
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:57.680]   they might treat the beats name the same way they used to treat ipod where they there's such this
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.080]   close association with uh with music with this brand that they know what they don't want to dilute
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.640]   it they don't want to change it they don't want to try to make the quote bold unhip square hard drive
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.920]   box ipod make that name into the thing that we that we try to get young people interested in
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.160]   and it's possible they're just going to keep the beats name and make that so make that so intrinsically
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:22.480]   connected to apple that we assume that consumer music gadgets is always beats and the consumer
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   consumer music gadgets that run apps are always apple brand there were 95 mac reported uh there
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:35.920]   would be layoffs beats and apple said no uh the there have been no layoffs except for about five
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.680]   performance based terminations um however and all employees have been offered full-time jobs at
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   at apple however uh a number of beats employees were informed their positions could be subject
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:53.520]   to elimination in three months to a year i would guess that's like the hr department you know we're
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:59.680]   done in business yeah absolutely um but everybody has apparently got a job at least for now which is
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.560]   unusual you'll have enough time to get the discount at the apple store but you use that in the first
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.680]   use that by the end of the year it's your company store purchase is done now yeah get those teachers
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.760]   why you can but jimmy and andra are taking care of at least they've got an office uh i i wonder
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.520]   how much you're going to see them around uh the campus really um they've got other stuff to do
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.320]   i think i find a particular i do a lot of his stuff by fawn
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:31.120]   full negotiation stuff like yeah yeah he's down in l.a. you want somebody down like like i've been
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.960]   down in l.a. doing the good doing the contracts and stuff right i think i'm curious to see i think
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.680]   i i mean it seems like as though he's basically jumped off his the horses he was on last year and
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.120]   jumped on apple horses even if he's running them in l.a. i'm wondering how much day to day drey is
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.160]   going to be doing because he's still he's got a he's a ready still producer he's a music guy
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.920]   and apple doesn't yeah apple sells music but apple doesn't make me is it not yet
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:05.200]   wow i don't think i i just have the same we decide the absorbing beats is not going to change
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.960]   at we've fixed we fixed melodic interference and created a better musical experience wow
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:17.920]   we've cleaned up the marketplace to reduce confusion of so many options down to two
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.080]   good one good song one better song and one best song and of course they'll sound best and beat
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:33.600]   ten phones um oh part part of this was also buying i didn't realize is the vendy i think that's
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:40.000]   the universal music it's one of the big record companies owned 14 percent staking beats so apple
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.360]   had to fork over another four hundred four million chump change to buy them out so um
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.080]   that's all your your phone profits right there again no he don't see you know is he
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.720]   show me buying beats and well the nice thing about this they're uh paris based so this is four
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:03.040]   hundred four million dollars in funny money european money tax free who from ireland to
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:10.080]   france right no big deal um do you guys see really any change in the way apple does music or anything
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.920]   because of beats i'd say so uh certainly in the way they handle streaming uh they they
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:22.960]   beats was a very very small product but it had a reason to exist as opposed to uh
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.560]   iTunes radio which is a fine product but it doesn't really distinguish itself other than simply being
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.080]   something that's pre-installed on every single life phone that comes out there
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.680]   i'm also interested to see what changes come to the iTunes store we have just a powerhouse
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.040]   executive in the music industry that can cut these super super deals uh so there's he has
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.280]   business firepower but he also has creative fire firepower so i'm curious to see if he's
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.920]   has the ability to dangle some carrots in front of superstar acts to say guess what here's here's
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   the terms we can offer you if you if you agree to be iTunes exclusive for the first year of your
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.360]   of your act so they've just did really i mean he went to the rolling stones in person
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.800]   he uh you know he went to the hold the holdouts in person and he had after the beetles for years
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   yeah yeah he had star power they did that beyond Sadie i think it was last year where they
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.920]   basically took over every the entire store for a while and expect over if we look could we
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.400]   looking forward to a year from now suddenly a new channel appears in your apple tv that is
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.480]   the biancy channel that's only there for two weeks but it's there so that promotion of this
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   album and all the videos associated with it is just front and center on an equal footing with hulu
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.720]   plus for that two week period i think that we could see some really interesting things happening
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.800]   because of that i'd rather see a weird owl channel but that's just i would i would pay for a weird
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:45.600]   owl channel just eat it people think that weird owl stole that idea from biancy because she
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.440]   released all her you know suddenly an album is out in eight videos and blum blum blum blum
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:56.240]   but but but weird owl did it in 2011 i just want to remind everybody he invented the massive
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.640]   marketing push apple speaking of uh Akamai uh apple has been using Akamai for media delivery
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:10.080]   apparently um they've created and it's you know uh their own cdn and this is based on detective
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:15.680]   worth work dan rayburn we've had him on twit uh before he's uh an expert in streaming media he
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.360]   writes the streaming media blog and is an analyst at frost and selvin said by looking at the trace
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:29.680]   routes uh on os 10 downloads you can see they now come in from instead of from akamai from apple's
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:41.040]   own content delivery network a a p l i m g dot com apple image apple image dot com from uh isp
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   i've spoken with dan writes they tell me apples put a massive amount of capacity in place
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.920]   with many saying apple has more than ten times the capacity they're using today already to go
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.600]   is this a business for apple or is this merely about improving the consumer experience
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:01.840]   yes consumer experience i think yes uh they're business dan yeah right so it is business dan says
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:10.720]   apple still uses akamai for iTunes and level three for i radio uh an app downloads but he
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.440]   expects over time that'll all be moved over to apple zone content delivery network so for those
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.240]   who don't know what a cdn is we use cdn's everybody does ours is cash fly you've heard us talk about
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:25.440]   that at the beginning of every show the idea of a content distribution network is instead of
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.920]   having one server in kupertino or north carolina or petaloma that all the stuff comes from
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.640]   they have many many servers there there's one so they can be geographically nearby that does
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.200]   make a difference on the internet believe it or not closer is better uh and those servers have a
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.560]   special caching system that makes sure that they all carry the same content so for us when we upload
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.760]   audio or video of a show to cash fly then they replicate it to servers all over the world and
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.600]   when you download it you're downloading it from a cash fly server that's geographically
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.640]   proximate to you um and apples i presume gonna do the same thing it's not just no it does not
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.760]   just north carolina they have to have servers in a lot of places yeah they're building it out but
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:09.840]   this is again this is part of controlling your stack and we've seen them do this with uh you know
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.440]   they own the kernel on on the stuff they're making their own chipsets they're making their own
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.600]   programming language now and as much and i've said this before as much as we complain about apple
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.000]   being way too controlling often our biggest complaints are you know my my carrier network
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.880]   sucks or that ups delivery took too long or why is my iTunes timing out why isn't that for
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.080]   stuttering that's important yeah they want to make sure that when they deliver and we've had
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.920]   that to be by people would complain oh it's taking forever to download the ios 8 update they want
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.840]   to make sure that you have a great experience it's the same as opening a box to them it's part of
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:49.360]   the unboxing of their software and content experience um it's expensive and it's not and of course
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:55.280]   they pay a aacomai a lot so it's been expensive all along uh one one of the reasons apple always
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.960]   said we don't we don't make money on itunes even with 30 is most that money goes to aacomai and again
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.160]   you know one plus one is not doing a content delivery network you know because they're not
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.120]   building that into the price of their devices it was dan who told me that uh when the best place
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:16.160]   to watch netflix until they made deals with all the isp's and your isp's was on apple tv because
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:22.080]   apple served the netflix movies and video from its own content delivery network not over the
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:28.720]   public internet so apple tv always had better netflix yeah or they paid specifically for it in
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.640]   areas that they didn't serve it right yeah they made all they spent a lot of time on that experience
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.920]   have is that noticeable have you noticed that apple tv is better for some of this stuff
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.320]   he absolutely yeah yeah i i i switch between roku and apple tv pretty much on a daily basis
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:50.720]   depending on what i want to run and i will say that there are few i i spend less time on the roku
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.560]   looking at moving for one app to another looking at the spinning waiting or invalidating or stuff
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:01.440]   like that but i almost never see a stutter in playback or cashing sort of delay on the apple tv and
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.680]   that's it's that routing you talk about that that sells that that's feature and by the way you know
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.760]   we in the net neutrality conversation we've talked a lot about these interconnects between
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:15.440]   Comcast for instance and level three uh back in may dan wrote that apple was negotiating paid
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.400]   interconnects with some of the biggest isp's in the us he said he wouldn't say which isp's but i
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.760]   think you probably in your head can name them uh and that's that's also really good it means you're
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:32.080]   not going to see these wars between you know uh Comcast and apple for instance saying well you're
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.680]   not giving us enough bandwidth uh they've got the interconnects set up throw money at their problems
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   yeah boy you know at some point you start to eat up all your profits so i mean you really
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.640]   yeah i agree wonderful make a great experience for your users i guess they must have a lot of margin
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.000]   that's what again that their entire their entire business is predicated on having that extra money
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.800]   to do all these extra things which is why i say you can't look exactly at the cost and margin
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   ratio on two different phones because that's only part of what apple's providing okay you that
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.440]   was right yet and the call back to an earlier conversation yeah and the dance for apple is always
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   going to be making sure that you're spending their money improving the experience in ways that users
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.320]   can really touch and appreciate as opposed to conceptual things that just get them to buy the
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.880]   next thing or upgrade to the next service uh so things like making sure that Netflix is the
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.360]   their Netflix version of Netflix is the one that never stutters that's money well spent
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.080]   presumably i would guess amazon's doing the same thing somebody the charam said his fire tv is
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:37.920]   beats uh his apple tv um i i i agree with that in a lot of in a lot of ways uh roku is the only one
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.240]   that's i've actually got four different streaming devices on the big tv in my livery room because i
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.680]   keep having to i keep having to try different things with everyone no one of them does everything
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   well also yeah i mean the the fire tv the fire tv is is probably the nicest experience over all
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:03.280]   the apple tv is the most consistent and fastest experience the roku is the most broad experience
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   where things that i have in my house i'd love to be enhanced through the use of this thing uh
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.200]   that's mostly true i look at it pro tv is an example they're not they right they're on roku
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:16.080]   we're on roku we're not and the and the crone cast over the past year has man it's like every
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.120]   this i i'm continually amazed by how much this little thirty five dollar thing that is completely
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.520]   invisible can do they keep making improvement they keep broadening broadening the number of apps
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.560]   on mobile devices that can exploit it they all they've also in greatly improved the way that
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:38.640]   youtube interacts with it so much so that uh i use the crone cast's link for almost all my youtube
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.280]   viewing even if i'm on apple tv it's the reason why i don't leave it on apple tv is because
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.560]   it's so much easier through the youtube app on on the roku or crone cast to simply be looking at a
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:53.280]   link on my laptop and then saying oh this is nice okay so they actually are gonna be spending 10
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:58.720]   hours building star wars lego models in real time i don't think i want that to be on my on my
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:05.440]   on my laptop but i'm kind of great to have on your big screen exactly you know that at hour eight
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.000]   they're gonna start hitting each other inviting each other i want i want that in the full HD
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.880]   experience but that's but in terms of i've got something on my on my on youtube on this screen
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.560]   i want it to happen on that screen it still happens on the youtube apps that are on these
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:24.320]   other machines and on apple tv i was watching chat i was watching you on my 70 inch panasonic
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.400]   viera last night what yeah through a crone cast was watching reddit up oh yeah yeah and it did and
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.600]   it did a great i have to say it really looked good and thanks to mark hanson who does this is a
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:40.960]   third party developer who does it's quick cast for for and read i don't know if he does it for ios
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.480]   but it's sure great you launch it and you can watch i watch you can watch storage shows like red
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:51.840]   up you can watch live stream too um and that really where it works nice and we don't use an s c d n
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:57.120]   it works pretty good because there's only there's only 12 people watching so
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.120]   isn't that a big challenge to apple and everybody else that tries to perfect the experience by
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.920]   giving us channels and giving us original programming i thought i had a weird experience the other day
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.960]   because for the first time i sat down and i actually found myself thinking as i picked up the roku
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:17.440]   remote i wonder what's on youtube now wow just the same way i used to think though i wonder what's on
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.720]   turn classic movies right now because there's so much great content coming through for a long
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.600]   time roku did not have youtube yeah i was late and coming and i think that they have one of the
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   best experiences possible now really yeah it just it works so well it's so intuitive yeah it's it's
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:38.400]   i'm part of it is that i i have such respect for people have to have to have to have to design
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:45.760]   such a caveman level consumer object because i find the reason why i usually keep my input
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:51.040]   pointed to the roku is that the roku has the best remote it's it fills the hand nicely the buttons
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:56.560]   are easy to find there's never any ambiguity about what these buttons do with apple tv it's a stick
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.720]   a gum that step one to to pause something is too five to ten remote i lose that remote yeah
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:05.040]   every and they're and they're so and there's so few buttons on it that oh man so do i long press
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:11.360]   this and oh no by just stop that damn it uh we're just the same thing and and you have to aim it at
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:17.520]   the ir port as opposed to uh low power wifi on on the roku and and you could you could definitely make
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.360]   the case that the apple tv is better engineered you can definitely make the case that the software is
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   a little bit that that holds on a little bit more on the ball and integrating stuff it's certainly a
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.640]   lot easier to throw stuff off of my my phone or my iPad onto it but the fact that this is really
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.840]   nice remote and this really nice youtube app and what i'm really connecting to is not a store or
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   anything like that but the same resource that every other thing wants to connect to that's what
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.240]   makes this my favorite nine and nine dollar streaming what's it it's also the case that
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.760]   you just forget that you have one i mean there's so many ways to watch youtube is an example
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.560]   that it probably goes in transiting you know you know it you know it breaks my heart every single
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:01.840]   time and like and i i i it has to kill people inside apple that i if i if i have someone who works at
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.400]   apple like over at my house i i could not resist pick up the apple tv remote silently like clicking
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.600]   on to youtube then walking over and pointing at that little menu option and the youtube app that says
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.960]   show me the most recently uploaded videos to youtube which made sense like five years ago when
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.640]   maybe 18 were being uploaded every single day but which of the 8.1 million every second do i want
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.200]   to see right now i i'm not i put it to you that perhaps this is not the most useful thing to have
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.120]   as the top level feature especially given that i have to click the button five times to get into
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:39.680]   my own personal subscriptions i'm saying i'm saying that this overdue for a major update it is and do
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.480]   you think we'll see one you do a great job it's a great product September 9th no this spring probably
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:51.520]   not spring yeah but that's hardware can we have a software update please well the with the ios 8
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.400]   beta the new version of the software was shown off but i think so far it's mostly just the new look
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.520]   like the ios 7 look to the icons right they're putting so much effort into the new the new device
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:08.560]   software stack that i think we'll have to wait for that okay within a8 well right now it's a single
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:14.800]   core a5 so i mean almost anything would be better the the bottleneck isn't the process or the bottleneck
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:20.480]   is still software oh it's Comcast or you know i i mean you got you got to have that good connection
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.920]   and that's right glimmers the best experience right now but yeah i do i do agree the interface
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.480]   is a little bit sluggish yeah our show today brought to you by our good friends at school
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.160]   where space when i was talking to kevin rose yesterday he said he did a foundation with a
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.800]   founder of square space anthony anthony uh castellina and he gave a tip of the hat to twit it's true
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:43.760]   twit and square space to go together uh like this if you you know if you are a square space user
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.240]   you probably first heard about it on twit we've been talking about them for several years what's
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:54.160]   great about square spaces to watch them not only do such a great job but never let up continually
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:59.280]   get better and better and better and this is good for you because it's not only is it web hosting
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.720]   and web hosting i i guess doesn't seem like it changes much it does there's a all well it's very
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   different now than it was just a few years ago but it's also the software on top of it and that
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.200]   i'm sure everybody knows it's changed the way websites work and look and feel for a long time
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.080]   you had a mobile site and a desktop site not anymore with square space all the sites look great on all

[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.320]   i did leo just as an aside i decided to build some lego live well and he watched wow the death

[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.200]   enough on his personal twitter account he tweeted first day of school hope the other kids like me
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.520]   from kupertino california that's cute eight thirty eight a.m to reek little bit a little bit of a hint
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.880]   you might want to get there earlier apple apple famously has an incredibly small marketing team
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.640]   like people have said for years that philish alert has never opened up the piggy bank for the marketing
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.480]   team and it looks like they are getting more progressive with that but you know in terms of
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.560]   social media they have a few twitter accounts they have a few facebook pages but nothing to the
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:18.000]   level of a lot of other you know major brands nevermind consumer electronics so someone with
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.040]   berbering knowledge someone with um nikey knowledge probably could be a huge help with them especially
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.160]   as things like celebrity selfies or what not become more important one hundred the twitter
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.480]   i wonder if the twitter accounts that are like belong to like shiller and tim coke i wonder if
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.680]   those are now not necessarily subservient to his office but at least part of the effort that he's
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.280]   launching uh in in social media tim don't press then yet wait tim tim tahaha apparently he's had
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.920]   great success german to the words anthony weiner nowhere nowhere
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.720]   but but his title is technically is a digital marketing director
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:00.480]   i don't think i can go a lot of different ways i mean you could do what comcast did and create
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:07.280]   uh you know accounts to monitor and respond to unhappy customers you have cares apple carriers
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.120]   and part of it is just simply using every single online service out there just as a
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.760]   new data stream of customer feedback not just people to her tweeting directly at apple but to see
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.840]   where the conversations are going what the velocity of those conversations are
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.160]   and what if there's a if uh there are a whole there are a whole bunch of people that are having
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:32.000]   problems with uh the iphone five camera ever since the ios ever since ios 7 came out so it's a long
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.760]   long long thread of the support form just just as an example and right now it is a hands it is
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.320]   apple can think of it as a handful people that are having a very unusual problem but a social
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.400]   media director who is able to look at what's happening on facebook and twitter and instagram
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.640]   about people complaining about it notice that velocity is really picking up it was a trickle
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.360]   when ios 7 first came out now there's just lots and lots of constantly new people adding to this
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.280]   thread that is information that they can then feed engineers saying that this is not something
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.200]   that will handle on a user by user basis this is now a problem that we're really going to have
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:09.360]   to attack and address right now sentiment analysis yeah i mean there's a lot of ways he also he's
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:15.760]   very famous for the uh he using twitter to preview uh it was called the campaign was called tweet
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.360]   walk back in 2011 to preview outfits to soon from uh berberay soon to hit the
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.920]   London fashion show runway uh there's a couple of things from this i mean
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.320]   famously customer retention is much cheaper than customer acquisition so anyone you can keep
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.800]   engaged and happy through social media is one more person you don't have to convert but also for
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.720]   a while now apple's getting much more savvy in the old days you could rely on people going to apple
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.440]   dot com or itunes dot com to find the stuff that they want it was a poll-based system but increasingly
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.960]   for example flip board is sort of putting i books in there because that's where their customers were
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.800]   so starting to push out their products and social media is a huge surface area that they
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.360]   probably feel that they can better cover for example if they had deals on on twitter or they
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.000]   had collections on Pinterest or whatever he figures out it's a way to get more eyeballs on
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.280]   your your brand and your product they certainly could do a lot better i mean they really don't
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.680]   seem like they're very involved in social media do almost nothing they do almost nothing
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.760]   tim cook tweets right tim cook angel aran's eddy q and phil shiller occasionally they have a podcast
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.760]   account they have a the the nice thing is that i i think i'll compare my impressions with rene so
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.640]   that everything i've heard is that these are real genuine tweets as opposed to that's true
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.400]   decided that this we've decided that now that this the second week in august is a good time for
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.120]   tim to say something about how nice the weather is that this they're not they're not voracious
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.320]   tweeters but they that is actually that person expressing that sentiment big win they could
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:44.960]   tweet about ford has ditched its blackberries for iPhones that's because i mean when leo or is it
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:51.120]   just mean at this point i mean i think that 3300 iPhones by the end of the year that's uh i mean
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.080]   it's not insignificant over the next two years six thousand more employees will replace
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:05.200]   according to bloomberg blackberry flip phones so it was about time well i think i think it's more
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.480]   blackberry news than apple news because man i think i think i think so i think the last last time that
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.080]   blackberries uh senior staff said what it was talking about where they want to go broadly speaking
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.000]   they were going more towards we're not gonna we're never gonna have the sort of saturation we had
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.120]   before the iphone came out but we're going to be the best possible support and the best possible
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:31.520]   hardware for a class of users that aren't being supported well by android or by by ios and man
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:38.000]   for them to lose the most businessy business there is in all the world of business the dear
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:49.600]   blackberry passport didn't hold them down no big big story uh break in a way breaking
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:58.560]   story and some hand ringing going on about ios i'm sorry os 10 um your 70 10.9.5 they're changing
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:06.240]   the gatekeeper app signing rules yeah and will you explain this rene richy so there's currently
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:11.200]   there's three ways that you can get apps uh on on os 10 and it changed over the last couple
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.880]   years previously you just installed them willy nilly any way you want it now you have the option
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.080]   of locking it to the app store if you want to make sure that only apple approved apps ever
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.800]   touch your precious machine or you can insist that they're at least signed by a by a certified
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.560]   apple developer so that you don't have to get them from the app store but they come with the
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.560]   knowledge that you know that person is accountable for that app and that's the default setting that's
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:37.360]   what i use so i can't install unsigned apps but i without overriding it yeah you have to do an
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.160]   explicit user actually not it's not a big deal but you can but yeah you right click say open and
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.080]   it opens it but it stops you unintentionally downloading right malicious so and i think that's
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.480]   a i think this is a good thing in a very good setting it's kind of a perfect way of keeping
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.800]   people safe and it is i believe the default that you can either get it from the app store or it has
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.200]   to be signed the new rule is that it has to be signed by a version of os 10 10.9 or greater
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.280]   now i don't know this for sure but the scuttle but i heard yesterday when this came out is that
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.680]   maybe the the signage previously wasn't as good or they found a better way to do it or there might
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.280]   have been some vulnerability and i don't want to start rumors based on that but it it sounds
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.200]   like this is just a better more solid way of signing it and they've been encouraging people
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.160]   to go to it for a while now and it doesn't seem that onerous if developers have stopped developing
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.240]   an app maybe it's annoying to have to go back and do it but it looks like it's a very small
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.160]   amount of work and it provides better a better protection. Sarah and i were talking about this
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.560]   and i've had today yesterday that the vast number of kind of abandoned apps in the store not so much
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.520]   on the Mac but on certainly on iOS maybe this is one way of kind of cleaning out the craft you know
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   you can't you can't use it if it's not signed recently. You have that's gonna have version two
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.160]   signature so yeah they must have changed the signatures and that's gonna happen as people
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.080]   discover more vulnerabilities as cryptography improves as the system changes significantly
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.800]   enough to require maybe there's more there's more permissions available now and those weren't
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.080]   accounted for in the original model. You're right this doesn't seem onerous i'm looking at apples
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.200]   that note to developers if your team is using an older version of OS 10 pre 10.9 to build your code
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:22.560]   just re-sign the app using OS 10 version 10.9 or later and you just use the code sign tool and
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.640]   you'll have a version two signature apps signed with the version two signatures will still work on
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.560]   older versions of OS 10 so it's downward compatible and if you are on the app store you have to
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.440]   resubmit your re-signed app as an update and you probably have to update things anyway if you're
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.920]   still on the app store. Are there people like so oh my god it's breaking everything it's only in
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.800]   the it's only in the developer previews right? Yeah the developer preview for mavericks and for
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.160]   Yosemite. Oh mavericks as well. Well at mavericks they always see the new the next iterative update
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.040]   to developers before they see it to the general public. So 10.9 point what is it four or five now?
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.560]   Five I think. We'll include this as well as Yosemite. Yeah 10.9 point.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   That's my understanding. Okay no no cause for concern yet.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.880]   No I mean like this is part of the cost of doing business as maintain like if there was a for
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.720]   example a big security exploit an apple had to perhaps something as a developer you might have
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.360]   to do something to your app as well this is part of the normal process. This is a really good solution
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:36.480]   this gatekeeper. We should just be happy about it. Popcorn time adds apple tv support I don't even
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.720]   know what that means. This is this is that app that everybody that's kind of illegal kind of quasi.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.760]   It lets you watch Torrance. Is that right? I don't know. Unless you stream Torrance.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:53.040]   Oh Chad you know. It's a fine I won't tell you. It lets you stream Torrance.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   Stream Torrance just like you would Netflix or something like that. And it was pulled off of the
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.200]   app store right? Well it's been it's kind of a weird project because the main developers I believe
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.480]   have left it and so the only things that have popped back up or other they made a sort of
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:15.360]   open source forked. It's super difficult to find a legitimate. I mean and maybe all the ones out
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.800]   there are but every time I have to use a jailbroken iPhone to use it or can I just can I get it from
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.640]   the apps? No I haven't used it. Apple would not allow this. I haven't tried it on iOS.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.920]   Airplay support is being added to the Windows release.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.680]   Mac version app do next week Linux version will fall shortly thereafter.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.480]   That's not I mean apple is closed in a lot of ways but if you can generate an airplay you can
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.360]   play it to all apple stuff. I mean there you know it's like you could if you make a web page you
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.640]   can play it on any version you can open it in any version of Safari. This is a cool one. Many of us
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:54.080]   have broken our iPhone screens. My kids break them every every few weeks and usually you go to a
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.960]   third party down the street. There's a little iPhone repair kiosk. They're everywhere now.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Apple says we're going to do it too. They're going to begin. In fact they probably will do
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.080]   it better because the five season five S's I think because of the way the glasses glued are
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:15.040]   they don't seem to be good repairs. They're easier. The four and the four S you could the back was
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.840]   really easy to replace because everything was for mounted. The five and the five S are front
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.320]   mounted so the screen is actually much easier to replace. Oh it is. Yeah well Apple's going to do
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.000]   it itself. It'll be a little more for Apple. So I've been paying like 90 bucks for a new screen.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.640]   Apple's going to charge about 150 dollars per repair. That's less than the 269 to completely
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.080]   replace the phone. If you have Apple care plus that price goes down. Ah good reason to get Apple
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.960]   can you get three. Yeah I think you get three repairs at a lower price. Okay.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:50.640]   This will happen August 4th next Monday. And they have that special machine. We had a couple of
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.240]   Apple geniuses in the studio audience on Twitter a couple of weeks ago and they were there for
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.360]   training. And I said the training how to use the machines I said yeah. So the Apple stores have
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.600]   these like weird gadgety machines that do these specific things like you put a phone in and goes
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:15.200]   dude put a new screen on it. Flexion cups the iMac screen off of it. Yeah. So that's good. So
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.480]   if you want to pay 50 bucks more I would because you know you're going to get it's probably
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.120]   warranty and all of that right. And you're first you're absolutely certain is the genuine part.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.800]   Right. And they have been issues with parts not being that good when they're done. Some
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.160]   third party manufacturers use fantastic parts but you you have to be knowledgeable enough to know
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.480]   the difference. So I went we talked last week or maybe the week before about the new MacBook Air
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.880]   ad with the stickers. And apparently it has generated huge sales surges in Apple's stickers.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:49.360]   Now I we used to get them from the first place I saw.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.280]   Jealouskin? Jealouskins. I mean I used to seem a Mac world every year. They had a beautiful booth.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.040]   Apparently they're not really doing that anymore.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:04.640]   Yeah. Matter of fact when I saw that was it on was it Dave Hamilton? Who was it who
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.480]   basically decided to track down every single one of those stickers. I think it was too. Apple
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.960]   runner maybe. Okay. Right. I was and I couldn't help but notice that most of the links went to Etsy
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   which to me indicates that perhaps these aren't actually licensed from from the DC comics and
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:28.960]   Fox and that sort of thing. And so I was trying to it really it really did put me in a reflective
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:36.640]   mode of thinking would Apple not care that they are showing like rip off non IP registered versions
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:42.400]   of trademark stuff. I think they have to register them. So much so much Apple made a lot of those
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.520]   themselves for that ad those aren't the ones that people those aren't the exact ones if people
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.120]   are finding Apple built a lot of those in house for the Apple.com slash MacBook dash air slash
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:58.080]   stickers they have them all one by one. So you can go there and see them. And but you know we've
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.240]   all seen people with these stickers right. Especially versions of them versions of them.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.280]   Yeah. But it's weird. I mean the snow white one is as far as I could tell legit and it's licensed
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.600]   by Disney I was able to find that page. But I was trying to find like the more obvious ones like
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:17.680]   the Snoopy and Woodstock one like the Wonder Woman one. And it's not that's that suspicious. It's
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.720]   just that it was harder. I couldn't find the Scrat. I couldn't find so many of these which
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.120]   really surprised me because I thought that something like the Homer Simpson one that must be
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.240]   you go to Simpsons.com you go to Fox.com whatever store page that's got to be a licensed thing.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.240]   It's so nicely done and so specifically done if they did it themselves. Okay.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:44.800]   So apparently jealous skins is now new Van Gogh. Okay. Why would you change your name? I don't know.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:51.920]   They're now new Van Gogh and really there it says more like build your art collection art gallery
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.760]   and find goods. It's a community for people passionate about great art. It's not what it used to be.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:02.480]   I guess I it's a lot easier just to have you commit the copyright violation than for us.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.280]   Ah, I understand. Well you can get there's a little clink at the top for skins and cases.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.120]   This seems to have all the gallery art plastered on your iPhones. Oh, okay. But they don't but they
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.680]   don't have at least when I checked a week ago or so I didn't see many that had like the actual cut
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.640]   outs for the Apple logo. So they don't. Oh, they don't. Yeah, they're not the same.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.680]   But you're right. I found them on Etsy. Oh man, did I find them? And to be clear,
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.000]   I don't I don't find this is I don't think this is a scandal of any kind. I just think it's
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.640]   there's so much about how businesses transacted on a national international ad like this. But it
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.960]   makes me wonder at what point did lawyers get involved to say that, okay, I know that you've put
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.840]   together this this this storyboard of what you would like to have. Here is what here's how you
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.880]   would have to do it if you want to really put the Walter White hat and and eyeglasses on it.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.520]   That's the one I want. Just just like I was surprised and really pleased to find that
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.320]   whenever you have like a commercial that uses like a Barbie or GI Joe type of doll,
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.000]   it's clearly supposed to be a Barbie clearly supposed to be a GI Joe.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.560]   Not only is it a unique art, but usually what they do is they actually will hire a specific model
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:13.360]   and make a model that is even at least nominally looks like this model that they hired so that
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.520]   they're that's the only way to make it bulletproof from from a Mattel or anybody else. They can say,
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.520]   no, no, it's not a model that the GI Joe look, here's Dave. It's model left or day. If you see,
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.440]   Dave has the eyebrows, Dave has the nose. Enjoy enjoy enjoy a piece of a bottle of water on the
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.360]   one your way out sir because we are bulletproof. I do want to I do want to I was thinking I just
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.960]   buy like a hundred of these and every week I should have a different one because interesting too.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.880]   If you go to the MacBook Airside unlike the iPhone ad sites where it tells you the apps with
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.920]   links and the no links to buy. Yeah, links. Yeah. I love to hear.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.520]   I didn't get too far with this, but I would love to for somebody to do like a definitive
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.880]   history of the Snow White and the Apple sticker because this is our version of Calvin peeing on
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.680]   the Chevy logo. Yes. It's like it didn't exist and then it was everywhere and not just the
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:08.720]   licensed one but knockoffs forever. I would love to and that might be the sort of idea that was
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.920]   so clear that several people had it pretty much as soon as the Apple logo started glowing.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.680]   But I would love to see someone do a definitive history of that because that there's somebody
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:22.480]   out there who first managed to get that into people's hands and I think that person I want to buy
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:26.400]   about cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee or at least send them a $5 Dunkin Donuts gift card. That was a
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.680]   cool idea. I wonder if there's a variation in quality on these. I mean you want the jealous
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.520]   skins were on a three or a special kind of 3M material you could remove and all of that.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:45.440]   Here's one of the Etsy stores. This is oh yeah decal on Etsy and you know I doubt that they
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:52.400]   registered Ariel on their made. The master Disney license. Yeah. But these are easy to make if with
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.280]   cut out vinyl. So I think I would guess that the black ones are just vinyl cutouts right?
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.080]   Which means they might be a little tricksy to apply because a lot of those things are just
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.520]   individual pieces like this one if you bought this you'd be spending a little bit of time.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:15.520]   That's after after sales. That's your problem. That's your but it's only 10 bucks. They're a
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.560]   lot cheaper than the jealous skins. Jealousy skins used to be very expensive. That business has
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:28.720]   changed since I since I have looked. I want to get the Walter White hat though. I really like that.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.040]   Yeah. Do you think John Paul, George and Ringo are getting a buck 50 for every one of these?
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:41.280]   Yoko. Oh, notice it doesn't say Beatles. It says beat ease. It's the beat ease.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:48.720]   That'll hold up in any court along. The beat is a parody. Who are the beat ease?
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:59.520]   Orange and his wife. Whoops. Oh, I've been on the shick on the sticker sheet. It's B E E I T S.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.680]   If someone wants to put those letter letters in out of order, you're horrified as you are
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.400]   Beatles. But what can we do to stop that ships worldwide from Beijing and the.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:16.720]   It's the Apple Apple computer and the Omega watch. Yeah. It says by the way, the materials are 3M
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:23.280]   Avery, vinyl, decal and sticker. Well, let's say let's something's happened since I last checked.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.680]   I don't think 3M and Avery are the same company. If it was 3N, it'd be funnier. 3N.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.840]   [laughter]
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.320]   So buyer beware. But you know what? I think this is actually I'm glad Apple supported this
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:41.920]   by doing this ad. It certainly helped the sales of all these phony stickers.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.880]   Now, Apple had their act together. They'd have a whole section of the store. If Angela had gotten
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.760]   their earlier, they'd have a whole section of the store with stickers ready to go for ads.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:54.640]   I wish I wish. The decal guru is apparently the world's largest collection of MacBook
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:03.120]   decal stickers and they have a lot of these. And I guess this is not Etsy and they're not
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.440]   ex some of them are cheap. Five bucks, some of them are 12 bucks, all of them are less. Oh,
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:13.600]   look, you could turn this and confuse everybody if I use this one. Turn your Apple into the Google
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:20.640]   logo. Is it a Chromebook? Is it a MacBook? What is it? It's a cat book. It's a cat book. Let's take
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.880]   a break when we come back. Your pics of the week, my friends. Actually, a couple of real quicky
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:33.360]   things before we know. I guess that's it. I guess that's it. No, we'll save the quickies for
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.720]   another time. Our show today brought to you by hovered.com, the place to go to register your
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:43.600]   domain names. When we first started using hover, I transferred everything from all, I used several
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.960]   different registers, registrars, transferred them all over. Hover makes that easy to do, by the way,
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.160]   with their concierge transfer service and no charge to you. The transfers are great too because
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:00.640]   for most domain names, you keep the time left on your registration, plus you get an additional
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:09.120]   year for $10. Hover is also great because that includes who is domain privacy. All their registrations
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:15.760]   do. They know you want that. There isn't a 50 click upsell thing going on here. You go there,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:24.160]   you get the domain name, you register it, you can add email to any of your domains. The domain
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:29.360]   management system is beautiful. Every domain includes unlimited domain forwarding, the who is
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:35.440]   privacy, the fantastic domain management and DNS management tools that are very easy to use.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.440]   They're not obscure. You can go in there, make the changes, including bulk management,
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.680]   which is great. They have such a good support team. In fact, hover takes pride in the fact that
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:51.280]   when you call their support team during business hours, a representative will answer from hover
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.760]   who is empowered to help you to solve your problem. You will not get put on hold. You will not be
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.600]   transferred. You will not wait. There's a real person there waiting to help you.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:06.640]   Wait a minute. We can get MacbreakWeekly.net.org.info. Quickly.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:12.080]   Real quickly. Yeah. I got over that. I have hundreds of useless domain names now.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.720]   That's $15. You're not going to get back again.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.400]   Never use. Take advantage of the Valley Transfer Service. If you're on another domain
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.440]   registrar, let them do this for you for free. They'll even handle the DNS settings and all
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.560]   of that. Unlock the domains. A lot of registrars are kind of the lock it down the minute you say,
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.080]   "I'm going to jump in and move it." Hover's honest. They don't believe in heavy handed up
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.720]   selling. They include everything you need with your domain. No more, no less. Also include custom
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.360]   email. You get a smart control panel. Who is privacy and the best customer support around?
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:49.680]   If I sold you on it, go to Hover. Hover Heroes. The Canadian Heroes. They're Canadian heroes.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:56.400]   They're the two cast folks. Go to hover.com and use the offer code MBW8 because we're in August now.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.840]   MBW8 and you will get 10% off your first domain purchase. Buy all those domain names you've
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.000]   been waiting to buy and get 10% off. Hover.com, MBW and the number eight.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:17.360]   Another nice thing about Hover is that unlike other registrars, if you're just sort of thinking
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.440]   about something and you're curious, "Gee, is this taken or not?" There's other services I've used
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:29.440]   where I'll look at, you know, orange screen of deathjustice.com. And I'll tell me, "Oh, orange
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.200]   screen of deathjustice.com is available." Then, "Okay, I'll think about it." Then I come back the next day
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.640]   and it turns out that it's been parked by probably the service that now wants to charge
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:43.680]   $180 for it. Yeah, I won't say anything about that, but this is a known practice that's bit me too
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:49.600]   on some of those other guys, not Hover. Hover is great. Yeah, we love Hover. We love our Canadian
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.920]   friends, speaking of which from Morial, from Quebec. Rene Rishi. Rene Rishi.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:02.880]   Ah, merci lio. His pick of zu week. So, my pick of the week is actually an Australian app, so I'm
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.440]   going to circumnavigate the globe for a minute. And it's an old favorite that has just been updated
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.880]   this morning and that's iStat menus. Oh, I love it. It's terrific. It's gone to iStat menus,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.120]   five full disclosure. Mark Edwards, who runs Bajango and makes this app is a good friend of mine.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.000]   So, we had Peter Cohen do the post for iMOR just to make sure that Peter gave it a thorough testing.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.280]   I've always used it. I know so many people use it. We all love it. It's got new features now for
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.200]   Mavericks and Yosemite, so it can do things like keep track of the battery shaming. You can use
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.480]   the dark mode in Yosemite to blend in with the menu. Oh, that's nice. It is just there's a list
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.040]   of improvements. There are some of them subtle, some of them profound. Bajango does a great job.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.480]   You can't get it from the Mac App Store because this is not the kind of app that Apple wants in
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.680]   the Mac App Store, sadly, but you can get it directly from Bajango and their customer service is
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.240]   excellent. Their apps are excellent. The design is beautiful. The functionality is just what you
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.280]   want. They have an iOS app that you can use to remotely monitor stuff as well. And I just,
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.360]   I have this running because I want to be able to sit in my living room and see what's happening
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.800]   to my Macs in the other rooms. Didn't they used to, was this a dashboard widget originally?
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.120]   They were originally iSlayer and they made the iSlayer widgets which included the
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:19.280]   iStat widgets and then it moved to the menu. It became the Jango. Yeah, better in the menu.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.280]   And I imagine they'll start doing some notification stuff. I really hope so, but Leo, I can only
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.480]   imagine what would happen if you hook this up to your new Mac Pro and you drop that list down
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.600]   because I think it would look like NASA or NORAD. I'll send you a screenshot. I'll tweet it. I'll
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.760]   tweet it when I get home. That'd be fun. Yeah, by the way, just to update on that Mac Pro,
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:47.680]   somebody called it the Mac Tube. I love it. It's working flawlessly. 4K screen, beautiful. I put
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.320]   Yosemite on it, loves it. Everybody's happy. Haven't had one problem, not one.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.920]   Except that it has no CD burner. So I've used the old Mac Pro to burn CDs.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.640]   What's the CD Leo? CDs. I make mix tapes for all the girls I meet. Like the
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.680]   Guardians of the Galaxy mix tapes? I mean, yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean it's tape for you.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:18.000]   I hope you like it. Things have 347 mix tapes now. Thing with me when you listen to it.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.160]   And you're not co, you're picking the week. I bought myself a toy last week that I've been
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.560]   wanting to buy for a while. I bought myself a Raspberry Pi. Oh, and oh boy, are these things fun.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.880]   A lot of people are probably familiar with Arduino, which are these little like
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.840]   single board controllers so that you hook up to your Mac via USB and you load code onto them
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.160]   and they can do things like throw lights, flip switches, control motors, stuff like this.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:52.160]   This is sort of like the, that to the second or third power. So this is a $35 computer.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.600]   And it's not just the hobbyist thing for for twirling motors. It is a $35 computer. And if
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.640]   you want to just put code on it and put your own hardware on here so it's controlling lights
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:08.080]   or controlling a robot or doing wiring up, making your toys do really fun and interesting things.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:13.520]   You can do that. But this also has four USB ports. It also has an Ethernet
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:20.480]   connector built into it. It has a full sized HDMI connector over here. It has a full size stereo
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:28.960]   audio connector that also does composite video and it has a micro SD slot for storage. So really,
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.120]   if you want to, if you want to use it as a hardware hacking platform, you can do that.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.840]   However, if you want to simply plug this plug in a mouse and a keyboard and a screen on this
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.400]   and use it as a Linux computer that can run LibreOffice or in a browser and stuff like that,
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.160]   you can also do that. If you want to use it as a prototyping board, you can do that. If you want
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:54.640]   to put it into a $8 plastic case that's designed for it and turn it into a standalone XMBC,
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:02.000]   media player, the software that runs that is as good as almost anything else that I've got
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.920]   plugged into any HDMI port that I've got on my big screen TV. I love it because it's,
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.800]   you can program it with Python and a couple other different languages. It really is the first
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:19.360]   computer I've bought. I've had since I was a teen that really brought back what I loved about
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.560]   computers as a kid, where I feel like I own this computer. I know everything there is to know about
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:29.680]   it. I can build things for it. I can write things for it as opposed to I can sort of write an app
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.160]   for it with lots of really wonderful APIs, but with the permission of the company that makes this
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.400]   thing, I can do that. No, no, no, this is there are many computers like this, but this computer is
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:44.320]   mine. The other thing is that I love the fact that it really is so versatile. I also have a couple
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:49.680]   of, I've been using Arduino's for a good long time, but it's only good for certain types of hobby
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.800]   projects. This, again, if I want it to be a word process, if I want a word process on it all week,
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:59.840]   I can use it as a computer. If I can put it into my Darth Vader electronic bank to have it
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:05.440]   respond to things via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, once I put the right transponders into those USB ports,
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:10.720]   I can do that. Then when I travel, I can pull it out of the Darth Vader bank,
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:15.360]   put it into this little case and then take it with me. When I travel so that when I hit my hotel
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:21.760]   room, I can just plug this thing into the HDMI port of whatever TVs in my hotel room. Because,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.240]   again, standard USB ports, I've got my 64 gigabyte little data traveler thing that has lots of movies
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.040]   and TV shows on it. Now, I can simply, without having to bother with carrying an Apple TV and
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.400]   linking it up with Wi-Fi and this, that, and the other, I can just simply have a VCR
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.520]   traveling with me that just simply has about 20 hours worth of high definition video on it.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.200]   And then when I come back home again, I pull out the Wi-Fi, pull out the data storage thing,
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.480]   and then put it right back and have it controlling my Darth Vader bank via Wi-Fi and the internet.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:58.320]   So it's so much fun. It's 35 bucks. 35's damn stinking bucks. You're not going to get a better
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.800]   bargain than that. And once you have this around, every time you think about, "Gee,
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.160]   I'd love to tinker with electronics." Well, guess what? You can probably do it with this.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.040]   Or anytime we've got a programming project, guess what? You can probably do it with this.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.800]   And the last thing to encourage you to actually buy one of these things is that there is such a
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:19.280]   powerful and potent community of people who've been messing around with these for the past year
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.840]   or two. And so pretty much you don't, you almost never have to build anything yourself.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:30.080]   If you want to figure out how do I flip on the switch of this electronic toy with this device,
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.280]   there will be a tutorial that tells you, "Well, here's, you'll probably want to do this with a
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.040]   power MOSFET. Here's how to wire that up into these little pins. And here's the script you want
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.600]   to write in order to do that. Here's how to write a script so that it will automatically tweet
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:47.040]   out the temperature to your Twitter account based on its built-in sensor. You can just simply go
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.120]   out and purchase the, excuse me, go out and get the Lego bits of all the different pieces of code
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.400]   and pieces of electronics that you want, and then build whatever you want. So much fun and 35
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:02.560]   damn dollars. Just go and get it. It's really cool. Which one did you get? I got the B+ which just
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.320]   came out a few weeks ago. And I think that's what really pulled the trigger because the first version
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.120]   was sort of a proof of concept. It was really, it was originally designed so that probably the,
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:16.560]   the marquee thing for people, the reason why this was open source design was we need a really cheap
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.320]   computer for kids in classrooms, whether they want to learn how to program, learn how to develop
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.880]   electronics or just serve the electronic courseware over the web or stuff like that.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:29.920]   And so it was good, but you needed to add a whole bunch of stuff to it to make it really useful.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.640]   Then they have the second version which had only two USB ports so that you couldn't do,
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.400]   you know, keyboard, mouse, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, you know, storage all in one thing. It was also,
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.240]   this one is not only has those extra ports, but also it draws a lot less power. You can power it.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:52.960]   It's powered from this standard micro USB port right over here. That's not data. That's,
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.120]   that's just power. But this thing sips so little power that you can, I can drive it from the little
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.040]   battery charger that I have for my phone. So if I want to, you know, do something and make it
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.680]   completely portable, if I don't want to do something as complicated as develop like a whole power
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.360]   bus for all of my electronics, I can just again grab my, grab my phone charger, grab USB cable,
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.880]   put that in the box. Great. It's portable. You can get them at Radio Shack. So help Radio Shack out
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.600]   because you're about to go on. But you can also see, I just, I just feel like it's kind of mean
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.640]   to come in there and say, no, I really only want to buy this $35 thing that doesn't require to.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:34.800]   I'm, I'm so sorry. Really, I am. But I did bring this can of only recently expired canned food.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:40.400]   It's all pretty good. And once chili, did you get it? Adafruit? Did you get it at Amazon? Where'd
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:45.280]   you get yours? I got it from a, I bought it from, I actually bought it from, from, from Amazon. And
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.200]   they've all kinds of, you can buy them as parts of kits too. So even if you don't want to even
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.520]   monkey with making any components whatsoever, you can buy add-on boards that deliver like the motor
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.000]   controllers and the server controllers. But mine was, it's, it's manufactured by a bunch of
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.840]   different places and mine was manufactured by element for me. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah, which
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.840]   is, which is also a great source for more information on how to program for it, how to do things for
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.080]   it. It's, it's, I can't recommend it highly enough. And the other great thing is that there is,
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.920]   it's the acknowledge that this is going to be the first time people have used a computer that
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:22.160]   needs to be set up before you can use it. And so there is this, you download a 1.2 gigabyte file
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:28.880]   called noobs and OBS. And you simply, you unzip it, you copy the files onto a comp,
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.840]   onto a micro SD card, put it in there, connect it to a monitor and boot it up. And it will show
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.360]   you because the noobs installation has, if you want, if you want this to be a Linux computer,
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.520]   here it is. If you want it to be a media server, click on this. Four, five or six different distros
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.480]   are on that, are on that file. And you click it, you select what language you select your time zone,
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.800]   click another button, and it will just simply configure this card for, to make this into whatever
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.640]   you want it to be. And I'm sorry, I'll stop, you can tell when I get enthusiastic about things,
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.240]   I tend to br- brble on. But the last thing I will say is that there's nothing I like is that
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.360]   this is all of the storage for it. So if I want, I can actually have like one card that is,
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.000]   makes this into a Linux computer, another card that is a media server, another card that's something
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.800]   else entirely goodness gracious, the fun that you're having with this. This really is like digital
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.600]   legos. You just, it's just a box with stuff on it. And then it responds to your imagination.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.920]   I feel like someday I'll retire and then I can just retire with my Raspberry Pi and
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.040]   Andy live streaming on the three Python.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.640]   AidaFruit is a really good place resource for this aidafruit, a D A fruit.com. They have not
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.880]   only the Raspberry Pi, but a lot of add on boards, cameras, all sorts of stuff. Plus they do very
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:44.160]   good podcasts that describe this. We have a podcast all about, this is the aidafruit page just for
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:49.520]   people watching the video. And you can see all of the modules you can add to this. It's really
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.400]   quite amazing. And by the way, it's not XBMC anymore. You know, they renamed it. Yeah, they
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:01.760]   changed it to terrible name. Cody, the Cody Entertainment Center, just so you know. And another plug,
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.840]   we interviewed even up in the founder of Raspberry Pi. This was a couple of years ago. So it's a
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:12.720]   little out of date on triangulation, triangulation 61. But he talks about the motivation for doing
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.840]   this and how it got together. And we have, I think, several know how episodes on the Raspberry Pi
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.040]   with Father Robert. So lots of Raspberry Pi information here and elsewhere. It's really cool,
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.480]   really, really simple. My pick of the week is not yet out, but it has been announced for iPhone and
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:36.320]   iPad Bioshock one. This is going to be a port from 2K games. They haven't announced a price,
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:41.360]   but they do say it will be a premium product, not a freemium product. Thank you. Yay. Yay.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:46.160]   And you'll be in Free Zone. Kardashian Free Zone. By the way, Kardashian is available on the
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:54.320]   desktop as well as iOS in case you're not available. Bioshock was one of the great PC games of all
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:00.960]   time. I mean, love the whole ethos, you're underwater. And it's it's so it celebrates
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.960]   and ran's objectivism. And it's just very interesting. And it really a lot of fun to play. I look forward
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:14.320]   to this because this is this is pretty exciting. And this is this is a port from the creators at
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.400]   2K UK. Don't know when don't know where don't know why don't know how don't know how much,
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:26.800]   but we do know it'll be a iPad iPhone and coming when it comes you will see me playing it.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.080]   You won't see him here. You'll see him play. Yeah, you won't see me here. I'll have disappeared.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:37.040]   Thank you so much for being here. Renee Richie is at imore.com. That's where you catch all his
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.320]   great stuff, including the debug podcast. Always a good listen. Thank you. Give us a plug. What
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.440]   do you got coming up on the bug on the next two debug's we have a giant space cat who did revolution
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.280]   60. And then we have Jim Ray, who was formerly of Mule Design vector tomorrow, though, which is a
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.000]   different show where have Don Melton talking about team building and how he built the Safari
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.200]   team at Apple and why it's better to have people who are trustworthy and teachable than people who
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.400]   are necessarily just smart or experienced. Awesome. And I do recommend the Marco Armant
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:14.560]   debug. He talks about overcast his podcast app. You have great. You're doing great stuff.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:22.720]   Really, really love your podcast. I am ORE.com. Great stuff also from Andy Inako. He is a writer.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.560]   What are you the tech guy? I am the tech columnist tech. The hub of all technology.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.920]   The Chicago Sun times with the mighty Chicago Sun. The mighty Chicago Sun times. He also
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.520]   has a little blog, C w O B the celestial waste of bandwidth. You can catch his great stuff. Andy
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.360]   I on the flicker and D Y I. And there's a couple of shows for the five by five network, including
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.400]   a not goes all Manac where he gets to talk about all the stuff he doesn't get to talk about here,
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:55.440]   including Guardians of the galaxy. You guys liked it? Yeah. I have not seen it yet. I'm
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:02.960]   Groot. That's the saying of the month. I am Groot. It applies to everything. It apparently does.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.000]   Yeah, we enjoyed it. Yeah. But I read the comics. So I don't know.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.320]   I don't I haven't seen it yet. Now, Renee, is there a is there a small compact luminescent
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.360]   glowing thing that they refuse to explain what the deal is with? There are any gems everywhere,
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.080]   Andy. Okay, I'm just I'm just saying that in every Marvel movie, there's the glowing thing
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.600]   that everyone seems to think is important, but no one seems to be able to explain it to the
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.000]   movie is built around that they're built they're building towards the infinity gauntlet, Andy.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.920]   They have to get those stones and you know, and oh, and you know this because they explain this to
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:41.760]   you in the movie. They do. Well, they don't mention the gauntlet. No, but well, I know those
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:48.160]   spoilers here, but I think there is a glowing lump of something. Oh, it's a Marvel movie. So
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.000]   I know it's a glowing lump of something. I just don't know. And I actually love the
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.720]   required walk at appearance of the rocket's great. But the required appearance of Stan Lee in this
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.440]   which he plays a lecherous old man with a young girl on his arm. Huge stretch.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.520]   He's a sweetheart. I've met him several times and he is the sweetest man you could ever want.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.400]   You could tell he's sweet, but he's kind of laughing at their lap. He's laughing at himself a
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.680]   little bit now, which is why he's forget the movie, but he was in a Heffner jacket, I think,
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.680]   in one of these. Yeah, they're really playing up the the lecherous old Stan Lee.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.880]   What is the line for him? Is it a man for all seasons? Like, oh,
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.280]   to be to be to be 91 Stanley and alive. All the same.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:39.440]   Thanks for joining us. We do Mac break weekly each and every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.600]   Eastern time, 1800 UTC. If you watch live, you will see things that you never saw before. But
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:51.520]   if you can't watch live, don't worry. Fear not because we make on demand audio and video available
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:43:01.440]   after the fact of twit.tv/mbw and also on Stitcher and on our apps by our generous third party developers,
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:08.640]   everywhere podcasts are aggregated and performed. And today I'm going to let the close out be handled
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.600]   by the great folks from the Clone Wars show. Are you getting my audio?
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:21.440]   Okay, right time is over. Get back to work. Get back to work. We'll see you next time on Mac
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.720]   break weekly. Bye bye.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.740]   (drum roll)
