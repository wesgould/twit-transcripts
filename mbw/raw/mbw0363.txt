[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.560]   So you want to seal it you don't want to paint it or stain it
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.000]   What do you do is you take care of it? So it's a good tongue oil or even a vegetable oil for maintenance is going to I thought we're just
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.960]   There's not a whole lot of your interest people

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.200]   And in fact, I know more about tongue oil than any human should be allowed to know
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.680]   Or vise queen. I'm a big vise queen guy. I know about how do you prepare your walls?
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.240]   You know to keep them old out a mille decides and all my expert. What are your thoughts on milk stains?
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.880]   We'll get to that above but first I
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080]   You're right. We're right. We don't want to blow all the good stuff
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.560]   Save that as in as de Vorex said you're wasting material
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.360]   Also here from Matt cast Adam Christians and haven't seen you in an age. Hey Adam
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.800]   Yeah, it's been way too long and I had to follow Andy. I'm not I'm not as clever nearly
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.760]   Oh, you're more than you're more than clever enough. Just don't bring up tongue oil and you'll be all right oil. Mm-hmm
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.880]   Where are you working these days because you were at Nick's software
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.560]   And I want to ask a little bit about what what's happening Nick and how you how the Nick folks feel
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   But what are you doing these days? I?

[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.920]   75% I do a little programming on the side here and there I love that web developer and you know
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   That's what I was doing at Nick. I was their web developer and so that's what I'm up to these days

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.360]   We're gonna get Renee to tell us the scoop about this event coming up
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.680]   Hey, Renee, it's kind of Google how to polish silver to follow up
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.560]   You know I find that lemon juice makes a wonderful silver polish
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.240]   Vinegar the thing I've the thing I've learned about home improvement is really you just make this stuff up
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.320]   Really I went through home depot Leo. I finally realized what my mom feels like in an apple store
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   terrified
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.560]   What's a wrench?
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   And ladies and gentlemen live in studio mr. Alex Lindsey back from his global travels once again nice to have you
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   It's good to be here. I always it's always a good day when I come in and I see an extra chair. I know
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.560]   Alex is here. How exciting. I made it. How exciting
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.880]   Um, I really want you to donate blood because one of the things they ask you like in the form is like have you traveled outside the country in the past three years?
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.320]   And then they make you list every country you've been in and they look
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.800]   Which one has malaria warnings?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.960]   And I think that that would be that would be two hours in which well we're closed right now and none of the people who know how to work a needle
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.040]   Have know how to do anything
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.560]   And we'll go to we'll go to north of the last continent actually, you know what they may have a malaria vaccine
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   Did you see that maybe big breakthrough?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.440]   I just like we killed them all kill all those mosquitoes pf spz
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.240]   Blocked the disease in early clinical trials
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.640]   That would be huge. Wouldn't it? I mean malaria still is a plague. Oh, no, it's it's a big deal. Yeah, I've had it
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.240]   What no one time you never lose it right? It's always in your blood
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   Like you have our own name right now
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.440]   Just thinking about it. Malarial flashbacks. No, I wonder that really yeah, it was bad
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.160]   Is it it's a parasitic disease right from mosquitoes? Yeah? Yeah, it's I mean it's it's um
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   I don't know. I'm not a malaria expert
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   I just know that it feels like the flu except it's like 10 times worse and you get a bad
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.400]   Fever it's been a lot of time. Yeah, really bad fever. He's been a lot of time bed
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.640]   a lot of I'm glad you know I'm glad you feel better
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.800]   Well, the thing is the big thing is is that it's you don't
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.040]   Uh, there's three I think really three types of mosquitoes that carry malaria and two two of the strands are not
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.320]   You know as dangerous. That's what most people get what I got. Oh, you got a mile in malaria
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   I don't want to know about the other killer malaria
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.040]   But the other one is much more lethal
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.200]   But you know, here's a good thing is you have the excuse to drink as many genotonics as you know
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.800]   I I have used that excuse in africa quite often more coin. I'm please
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.760]   Get me a g&d. I know i'm taking malarone
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.560]   jian tonic
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   so september 10th
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.160]   And uh
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.240]   Now the fact that ena freed at all things d was the first to break this usually to me when I see the journal or all things d
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.320]   Break something even though it's still a rumor and we should say still a rumor
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.160]   Uh, I always feel like katie cotton called and said hey, uh, you know, don't don't say anything
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   Don't tell you I told you but uh, some temper tense
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.280]   Uh, and then, um, rene you got a confirmation from an equally reliable source not katie cotton
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.240]   Yeah, just a couple hours after her, um after ena freed and then I think dalrymple
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   Yeped it after that. So I would make my reservations at this point
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.120]   So what this you know, you I understand you cannot reveal your source
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.440]   You don't want to lose them as uh, but and but you do set you trust this source
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.000]   But really when I when I see it come out all the same time from the the you know three of the big
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.160]   viable
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160]   Apple uh reporters
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.640]   I feel like apple musta leaked this
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.120]   So I mean at least from my point of view, um, I I was getting closer
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.000]   I didn't get it before Ena did but I was getting closer depending it down and then once you know published
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.320]   It was easy for me to say well is this correct and then it was much easier to you know get a final
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   Because I don't talk your ear if we've got the right date kind of thing right?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.280]   Well, I mean like I'd heard rumors previous to this but something as important as the date of an iphone event
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.600]   I do never I never not ever want to get that wrong
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.840]   So I make sure I have at least two or three people who are in a position to know telling me the same date
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.240]   And I wasn't able to do that before her but after she published it was easier for me
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.040]   And I was actually with jim dalrymple in montreal he was here for the heavy metal concerts
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.080]   And sitting next to him while his phone was exploding with twitter demanding that he yet but immediately
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.560]   It's like an only imagine what he goes to that funny Jim. You're the uh, you're the arbiter
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.680]   I don't know how he got that title that role that mantle
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.720]   He's been around for a year. But a yep from the loop
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.360]   apparently
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   Seals it
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.280]   Um, or at least is another point of date
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.520]   I mean if you it's another day people who are usually pretty good at the dates and they're all saying the same date to me
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.880]   It raises and here's my you know me. I'm conspiracy-minded
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.240]   Here's my thinking apples looking at all of the phones coming out moto x comes out later this month september
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.920]   fourth
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.000]   The galaxy note three comes out you've got the 10 20 from nokia
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.640]   Now shipping on atnt in the us you've got some of the best phones easily the best phones we've ever seen
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.240]   Um from top marketers and apple really
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   Needs to kind of stem the flow and don't we think that they're jockeying for positions specifically because of apples announce
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.520]   I mean it seems like they're trying to make sure that they're all on on the you that they want to make sure that you choose
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   You're on the calendar. Yeah, they got to be on the calendar and um and my experience with end users is they're
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.280]   Surprisingly aware of all of this and I don't know. I mean I think our friends are very no no
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.880]   I'm talking from the radio show. These are normal people and you'd be I know we think oh my
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.600]   She has no idea when these things are coming
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.240]   There's a strong awareness of
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:15.440]   What's going on and and there's a decision going on right now among consumers about whether to wait
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.480]   I really think so and they want to know should I wait should I wait for the iphone?
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   I see some pretty good phones out there
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.440]   Um a lot of them are in the position of their two years. That's who people really are paying attention people whose two years is up
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.080]   I'm due for a new phone
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.840]   And we got calls like that all weekend from people on the radio show and so so they're very aware I think
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.040]   Just for the record leo, I mean I got the date first last year and I think the year before and that was not at all
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.360]   By apple pr that was just traditional
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   Sourcing and it might just be that at a certain point more people within apple or more people within the industry learn the date
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.640]   And it becomes easier to find out but i've never had something you know
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.360]   I've never had apple pr on the phone telling me oh this is ready to go
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:04.960]   But the fact that the date has been scooped so many times indicates that even if it's not part of apple's plan to make this a conduit for releasing information
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.760]   If someone touched that third rail and died you would never hear anybody leak that date ever again
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.320]   So I think that there's at least a quiet philosophy that this is not something that we are going to work very very hard to lock
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.760]   If if if someone has as leaked out
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.680]   The date of an announcement like that with less than a month away
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.880]   We are going to find out who where i try to find out who did it
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.000]   But we're not going to move having having a north to do that and I think that's the reason why it's not a bad thing for people
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.600]   No, it's a bad thing for people to know what apple's gonna announce september 10th
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   But it's not a bad thing for them to have a date
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.640]   Yeah, it's one of the reasons apple does it pretty consistently the same time every year, right? Yeah, right?
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.280]   Well, yeah, but it's here right well
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.000]   But when they make the change they you know in other words, it was known to be june june june june june
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.800]   Okay, now it's known to be i think it's well known september september
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.200]   This was the ipod event absolutely placed it with the iphone of it right
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.680]   And because i think i think in a lot of ways the june date was really driven by the original
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.480]   iPhone date so they had to give six months
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.920]   And so you before they released it because of the FCC and so then the june date became that but it makes a lot more
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.040]   Sense from a christmas perspective to be releasing in september
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   I understand what you're saying rene that you know
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.560]   For instance the the hall's been booked and this one thing apple will love about their new campuses
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.680]   They have their own hall. Yes, so there's less so the hall's been booked, but that's been booked probably for a year
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.600]   But well i'm sure it's musculating we don't know yet, but i would bet it's musculating
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.920]   It's not usually not usually musculating. I mean, i'm not you're a boy across the street here buboyna. Yeah
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.240]   That's not the last movie theater. I think oh really that's right
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   So they don't do it anymore at uh
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.600]   So san francisco has the herbaboyna center for the arts which is across the street from where mac world
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.960]   Is right next to it really and next to and mccone west was where the big steve jobs keynote's always were including the first iphone
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.120]   And is that's where the ipod events were always at the herbaboyna center
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.040]   Yeah, they used the theater that they did the rip burn music event way back when was that what they used last year
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.280]   They used to move one of those
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.800]   Yeah
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.400]   The sometimes move around there's a sent there's a theater in san hose they've used a couple times
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.720]   Well, where did they do it last year?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.080]   Did it one at your buboyna and one at the movie theater if i recall okay
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.840]   Well, and the ipad was at herbaboyna so um
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   That leaks out because of the event, but i think what you're saying and i think it's probably true rene
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.080]   Is that more and more people have to know we have to well and eventually the theater the event we have to put up kurt
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.400]   Right, we have a great banners and you get within a month. I mean you're there. There's print card
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.440]   There's things being printed and people go in places and eventually you know it goes
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.400]   10 people knowing about it to a thousand people knowing about it because it takes so much to get a live event off the ground
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.440]   So that's but at the same time like what you're saying about them probably not worrying about it as much anymore either
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.440]   There's a lot of incentive for them to
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.480]   Have this date out there because of all those factors you mentioned
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   Yeah, these other phones on the market they want they sort of want the information coming out for all those people who are on the fence and
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.560]   Wins the iphone coming so now they've got you know that time
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.840]   They're not going to rush out to the store and and pick up that new android device or something potentially
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.400]   Which begs the question why isn't apple just announce it?
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   Because they're apple
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.040]   I mean seriously people like Andy have to buy tickets usually a week ahead of time at the worst
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.920]   The most expensive air tickets because i
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.000]   But remember that we don't know what the iphone with a new iphone is going to entail there's always going to be a brand new features
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   That they can't they certainly can't eat that thing can't keep secret and they should in fact
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.320]   The moto x the moto x releases a perfect example of why you don't want people to know what you're doing
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   Because everything had been leaked out by the time they announced it. It was a disappointment
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.040]   Even Verizon's droid phones leaked all the yeah
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.320]   If rizin leaked leaked it out earlier
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.960]   So how okay this is the real question should buy your tickets yet
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.560]   Renee I did Renee did yes, andi
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.640]   Uh, I am why i'm working on it buy your ticket will I will reimburse you of course
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:11.440]   I I do agree that especially with Renee adding to the scrum. That's that's a good lock date. Yeah
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.400]   Um
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.440]   Adam you don't come out for these do you no i'm just a podcaster. I don't get
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.360]   Me too. I can't afford to fly to san francisco
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.400]   Well, pretty much. I mean you have to you have to be printer have a blogger
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.280]   I mean as far as I know they don't generally just invite just podcasters as far as i
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   I don't get invited so I might just do alt dot iphone event across the street at starbucks
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.440]   Well, we'll of course be covering it and we've we you know, we already
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.680]   I got the email from tony right away. Okay. You want to move tnt? I said tony
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.280]   It's a month off and it's a rumor
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.400]   But I think we'll probably start planning it and anybody who is not in the room is invited to be here for our live coverage
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.920]   I might go down. I got a new toy that we should play with down there
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.360]   So maybe you could be part of rene's of drone. Yes, Alex has a drone drone
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   quadcopter
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.840]   No, we're gonna satellite dish
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.520]   Really?
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.640]   Like how big it's little one. It's like this and it's supposed to come in this week
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.000]   So it's it's like just and uh is it two way?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.960]   It's uh, yeah, it gives me eight eight megs up and down anywhere in the country. Can we rent it?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.480]   Of course you can rent it. All right september 10 but i'm for this. I want you to wear it on your back
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.760]   I want a backpack satellite dish. This is Alex lindsey. I'm standing
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.760]   in the ground. I
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.160]   Don't do a hangout. That's what i'm gonna. Oh, let's do a hang. All right
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.800]   So if you and rene want to be down there, you know the sam of rt room or whatever it is across the street
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.680]   Yep
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.200]   Uh and and Andy you could be here or the I think you're going in today
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   This we're gonna send you in
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.760]   We never we never we never know who gets invited until the week before
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.320]   I
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.640]   I feel as though it's central school would be a good place to be on center
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.440]   I think one way or the other we're having a party here apple's having a party wherever
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.160]   Will all be celebrating so that's
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.440]   Go ahead. I was just gonna say that's the great thing about san francisco is so you can go and be anywhere
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Nothing happens. Yeah, that's like
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:14.000]   Oh, dammit. I got I didn't get invited to the apple event now. I'm stuck in san francisco for three days
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.920]   I guess i have to ride a cable car no restaurants. No, ah dang it
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.440]   Uh, here's the picture of uh, Alex with his uh
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.080]   satellite dish
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   backpack
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.720]   You know, you know the funny thing is if I if I actually
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.040]   The funny thing is if I wear those glasses. I actually don't look that far away from that
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.400]   I thought it was you. I don't know why it says al franken. I know senator. That's a
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Is al and uh
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.640]   Steel team six name and that is about the size of the dish
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   That's a joke, but I think it would work. I might you probably can't move those dishes
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.560]   Oh, you gotta aim them. You gotta aim them. Uh too bad
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.360]   uh
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   So, okay, so date
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.320]   Dates pretty pretty firm about as firm as you're gonna get
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.440]   But there is of course a lot of speculation. I keep seeing and every time I talk to experts like you guys
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.280]   So i'm gonna pose this for you. You know some things I think we are I think seem pretty sure and again you can
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.840]   Confirm or say your nuts two phones a five s which would be same chat maryam. You are on uh
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.520]   Yet from engadget yet on uh twit on sunday said yeah, they don't change the chassis every other year
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.640]   So the same chassis design slight differences and a five c
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.520]   Which uh somebody said that they're not gonna do that because the people call it five cheap
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.640]   That's the inexpensive, but I think the c will stand for color
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:44.480]   Um, so that all seems fair. It'll be plastic bag to be less expensive, but you know, maybe desirable in some other ways
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.720]   Um, but more adorable the rumor that I keep seeing
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.080]   Ming chi quo started. I think is that there will be a sapphire backed
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.640]   Home button that will be a fingerprint reader and outy and outy home button
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.360]   It's it's gonna stick out a little bit
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.680]   Seems not I don't know if I belies believe that because how do you put in a pocket without accidentally activating it?
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.920]   I think this is wrong in every respect. I'm just disappointed. It's not diamonds
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.320]   But the but a goal a gold phone with a sapphire outy home button and alicia keys is kind of driving for black air
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.440]   That'd be like more more bling. I've has lost his mind completely. I think we can throw the gold phone out
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   Yeah, that was another rumor. There'll be gold
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.480]   I think we could pretty much throw that one out there in china. Oh, well, that could be the chinese version
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.440]   iPhone 8 8 8
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.240]   But uh other than that
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.760]   Um, I don't do you really does anybody really believe you guys have said this before but i'm gonna give you one more chance
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.040]   I don't really
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.960]   I believe the fingerprint rumor in the sense that they did make that acquisition last year also
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.320]   Anytime you see a technology that really improves authentication and makes things a more secure and be easier to use
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   That's something that that's those are two things that apple wants to put into every future that they do
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.800]   The problem with fingerprint authentication is that i've yet to see a system that works 100 percent of the time. It doesn't have to
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.840]   Well, it kind of does it doesn't really
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   No, I mean we and we have a
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.400]   We're getting them for other things and the the the thing about uh, uh,
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.160]   authentication is is that you
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.080]   Here's by the way johnny. I've uh, I guess it's leaked out of the place where they're making that video for well
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.880]   We've made the best phone we've ever made
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.440]   It's gold
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.920]   No, the thing with the fingerprint is it's the question is whether you're using it for identification or convenience
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   And so typically with the ones that that we're researching for a bunch of other things is that the the fingerprint makes it much more convenient
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.000]   And if it doesn't work, then there's a long code that you put in you know that you go back to the dial
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.240]   But that's the exact that's the exact problem talking about
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.920]   Apple we've never released that right
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.040]   But when people when you you take out you take the phone on your pocket
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   You want to get to the thing that you want to do with it
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.240]   You probably have a passcode on it
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.120]   And that's like a half second or a second long pause while you key it in
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.640]   If you
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.360]   If you tell them by the way instead of having to actually do remember this pin code and type it in manually
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.680]   Just swipe your thumb over the over the this this sensor as you're taking out of your pocket
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.360]   It has to work because this is something that people are just simply not going to be thinking consciously about and they feel as though
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.280]   This is going to be a one second pause between getting access to the thing they want
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.720]   So if it does Samsung would do it that way they would do a system that works most of the time
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.800]   But not all the time because they're not concerned about this feature being something the consumer keeps on all the time
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.600]   They just want it to be a cool demo something that they can show off something that they'll show up to their friends for the first week
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.720]   But then maybe their their Samsung was okay with the idea that someone's saying
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.520]   Oh, this is not working well for me. I'll turn it off after by a week rest
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   That would be the reason that would be a reason why apple would just totally not go forward
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.440]   And the technology is a similar reason why I'm skeptical
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.840]   When we first when we first started doing testing with it
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.360]   I mean the reason I'm interested is because biometrics for for you know
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.960]   I think is the future it's going and there's really three major biometric
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.280]   You know groups there's your fingerprint iris and facial scan
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.840]   Which can either use geometry or heat and and so the the those are the
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.120]   The three major ones that you're going to use and the one that's easiest to make work as a is a you know
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   As a fingerprint scan the what I thought was really interesting is we tried to break one
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.040]   You know five years ago six years ago
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.000]   We got one of those little ones that you have attached your thing and we had different people using it and it got it
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.720]   Every single time now the one the one with a little slit that comes with some of the hard drives
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.320]   We never can get that one to work at all. So so I think a lot of that stuff is
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.920]   um
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.440]   You know a lot of those things are there, but I think that being able to do that I know that drives me
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.040]   I I do not want to have my phone unlocked and I
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.920]   Definitely don't like typing in the code
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.000]   So I know that for me that would be a big feature
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.160]   Is to be able to even if it worked 95 percent of the time and if I was a little sweaty
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.640]   It didn't work and I had to type in like my standard code
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.080]   You know
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.680]   And and my complaint is and I have to I should point out that
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.800]   My my hang up about it is that I I think of it as a way of unlocking the phone as opposed as opposed to
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.320]   Simply a way of avoiding you have to type in your IT your ITunes password
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   So for things like making a payment or buying a cup of coffee or something like that
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:16.400]   People might be willing to you know swipe twice or tap twice to make it work. Right. It's just that I think it's I think it's a sufficiently
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.520]   It's a sufficiently complicated problem
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.040]   And as yet I think we've only seen one phone from another maker that tries to solve it
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.960]   And apple is not typically willing to be the first company to stick their neck out with something they're they're more
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.240]   Historically, it seems as though they come up with a with a great solution
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.520]   After someone else has shown a way to do it poorly. Well, I think you're both right. Here's the thing
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:48.720]   And I think you would agree anti if apple somehow magically was able to create a hundred percent reliable fingerprint reading and given that they bought a
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.120]   Fingerprint reading company a year ago. That's conceivable. Would they put it?
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.520]   You know, I I know typically they don't put anything that's not been done in their phone
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.800]   They still don't have an NFC but I but I but I if they did it like it wouldn't it be wouldn't it be a killer?
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.280]   Feature if we're really really reliable if it if it if it really worked
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.120]   Especially because apple is a company that has lots of infrastructure the things you can do with authentication
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.080]   Not just simply unlocking your phone. Well, well think of passport
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.760]   I mean you could put credit cards and passport and this becomes your wallet
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.080]   Everything you need
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.880]   Yeah
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   And all it's missing by the way
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.600]   And this I know from many interviews with people who are involved in currency and finance
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.520]   The big issue the total issue with money is authentication. Well, and if you can authenticate you and me we can have payments
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.760]   No problem. Right. And and when you're talking about that type of thing you're talking about not only
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.880]   Money you're talking about voting you're talking about all kinds of other things that you know as soon as we can do that
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.840]   And I'm not just talking about like political voting. I'm talking about voting on television voting on what I can do where you can only authenticate that once
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   And that changes it changes a lot of things very quickly. If I'm apple look if I'm apple
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.320]   I'm sitting here if I'm to cook I'm thinking we got to do something we got a we are being eaten alive
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.680]   Nibbled admittedly not big gulps, but we're being eaten alive by all by the ecosystem around us
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.400]   Which is coming up with a better camera with better everything in individual dribs and drafts
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.480]   We've got to do something that says
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.760]   We're the best and that means not doing something like NFC that's been done
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.000]   But doing something they've never done well and also now admittedly they have to get it right
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.240]   Well, I mean because they don't do stuff that well serie
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   I'm not saying serie and maps serie and map show that they can
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.960]   They can experiment, but if they could do it 99 right and it really worked
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.760]   Wouldn't you want to be the first out of the gate handy?
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:44.880]   Not that it's a it's a special situation because I think apple would do it if it would make their phone and their products
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.160]   Better and their services better. I don't think that they're they would even be necessarily thinking about
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.560]   Anything that has to do with anything that works outside of apple because that's I don't think that's a so
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.600]   I don't think that's a problem that apple can solve if
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.280]   That's going to be useful for payment systems outside of past book or outside of apples control
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   That's not going to be a decision that the industry is the banking industry is going to allow apple to make
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.000]   They're going to try to come up with their own solution of which apple is going to be invited to be a part
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.840]   So if if it makes if it makes apple is always if apple is fundamentally a ho a holistic company
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.080]   That anytime they put a new feature into the iphone it has to make the whole phone better again
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.640]   That's a fundamental difference between apple and sam song
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   Samsung is the company that will do a whole commercial about a feature where if you look away from the phone the video stops playing
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.080]   Without a real care about whether the feature really works well whether it's relevant whether it's enhanced the rest of the experience
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:42.320]   Rest apple is more than happy to keep nfc off of a phone because they can't figure out why it makes sense for the entire device
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.480]   That's the if we see a fingerprint breaking authentication
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.520]   We're going to see them. I think do it in a way that enhances the entire phone and not just simply adds a feature
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   In the commercial that isn't isn't it? Isn't it? Aren't there strings in ios 7
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.080]   That indicate fingerprint?
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.760]   Well, and the other thing is is that this is really hard to do like so what what we're talking about is really hard to do
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.240]   Which makes it very very hard to do at a low cost
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.000]   Which means that you put it in a premium phone and you and you make it something that if it if it works well
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.680]   It is a huge competitive advantage because a lot of the other companies that are trying to go for low low cost phones
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.640]   Suddenly you have governments and you have you know government agencies and corporations and everything else if this really works
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.040]   It means that you know, I know that in our company
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.760]   We wouldn't if if it really worked like if we knew that it was really going to work and it was really reliable
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.560]   We would require it like it would be you know, that would be the end of that
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.200]   You know
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.760]   Your phone has to have that in there because we we don't want to send anything to you that doesn't have a biometric response
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.000]   They have had phones like with finger
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.280]   I remember the windows mobile phone. I said it worked. I'm a reader and the android one that had there
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.200]   Yeah, and it didn't work and you know, Alex's point
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.680]   They'd have to get certification and still on top of that
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.360]   And some people would still want the fingerprint scanner plus the passcode because they want something they know and something that they are
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.680]   So they could have multiple authentication
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.800]   But I think and and he's exactly right. It's a coherence issue with apple is it does this make the product better and does it?
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.440]   Enhance the overall value of apples entire offering and if they can nail that it'll be in and i've heard
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.120]   Rumors are saying that it's in and then it's not in and that maybe it's 80 percent in
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.560]   But there were huge discussions about syri before they decided to launch that and huge discussions about maps
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.920]   And i'm wouldn't be surprised that there were huge discussions inside apple similar to this one about whether it works
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.440]   Does it work well enough and does it enhance the value of our product and at some point?
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.040]   Tim cook or whomever it will be will put a stamp on and say yes or no for this year
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.400]   Although if they're already building it and it's pretty clear they are already building it
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.920]   We're seeing such good images from china of the uh both iphones
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.960]   That it's obviously a production. They made they pulled that string they've had to have pulled that string
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   They yanked cameras out of ipods like literally a week or two before they they shipped them
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   So they're not they're one of the most agile companies
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.880]   But you don't build a fingerprint sensor which actually has to have some significant cost
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.600]   Into phones and then not turn it on
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.960]   Well, and we're only we're only focusing on the one thing you know
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.840]   Does that does the thing work and how would it function in the phone?
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   But there's a couple other rumors surrounding the story that you keep hearing one is that outy button
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   I mean the minute I heard that I said that there's no way apple's gonna put a
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.640]   sticky outy button
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.320]   On the iphone. I mean that just doesn't seem realistic. I don't even know why it would have to be
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.800]   Yeah, the other the other factor of being very good
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.440]   You'll you'll just use that this could cut their
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.480]   Ability to ship phones by a third if you want to believe those rumors and that's that's a significant cut
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.720]   Apple apple is not afraid of yield. I mean like I know they're not
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.480]   But like when these when these new when these uh when these uh
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.440]   These ipad these track pads
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.000]   Um when they first came out the rumor is from a very very good source
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.520]   Um, the rumor was is that the uh yield was 40
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.920]   So 40 percent of all the ones made would actually work to apple specification
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.960]   Correct. Yeah
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.480]   And retina panels with a same
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.280]   Yeah, yeah
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.440]   Yeah, I just think this is different though because this
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.840]   Project has been so awaited and apple's gonna want to ship these globally and have a ton of them available
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.400]   And that's just one piece of this right in my mind
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.520]   I'm seeing three reasons why they might not do it
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.600]   And not hearing a whole lot of reasons why they should go forward with it
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.360]   I think I think they want to get it in there
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.560]   But if it's not going to be 100 percent reliable and they're not going to be able to meet their design goals and they're having yield problems
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.760]   I can't imagine why they would want to do it. There's there's another another made in that
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.720]   I'm sorry rini. Go ahead rini. No, I was gonna say there's an argument to be made and we talked about it earlier in the year
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.880]   The iphone 5s problem that this is a talk cycle for apple
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.680]   They did the iphone 5 this will look to all intents and purposes the same as the previous year as iphone
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.040]   They already got erroneously called boring for the last iphone
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.200]   Even though it was rebuilt from adam up and this is going to be an extrapolation of that in an environment where like leo said
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.480]   You have moto x and you have samson galaxy s4 and htc1 and you have whatever the next next is for
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:55.040]   Is going to be so it's more competitive environment than ever where apple's bringing a product to market that may have less appeal than any product
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:02.160]   They've done iphone wise for many years and apple is not so insulated that they don't think about these things as well
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.600]   So if you know there's going to be something in that santa clause ad that has santa clause saving christmas with face time or with syria or with something
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.000]   And a fingerprint scanner could be a cool
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.600]   You know could be that could a good uh phil shiller demo a good santa clause commercial and something that at least excites people
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.840]   When they see the iphone 5s commercials
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.240]   I mean
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:29.200]   Thing that then i don't this i i myself don't like it when we turn this into a show about other people's phones on the people's computers
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.880]   But sometimes competing devices give you an illustration as different ways of working that actually work very well
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.800]   Moto x has a really good solution
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:44.080]   Which is trusted devices where if you simply have a bluetooth device that you can tell the phone that look if you are within proximity of this device
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.160]   And i've and there's a connection between these two devices just assume that i'm me
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.520]   Because if someone is inside my house next to this computer next to this iMac right here
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.040]   They probably already have access to anything they could steal from the phone anyways
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.560]   So don't bother asking for a passcode if i'm inside my car and i'm connected to this bluetooth
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.480]   It's not super secure though. I mean I have I use that i'm using it right now
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.560]   I'm saying but i'm saying that there are other when we five years ago for thinking of how our device is going to be secure themselves
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.600]   We always think what does how does this work in sci-fi?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.840]   Well, there's always a fingerprint scanner or we do a retina scanner or a blood sample or something like that
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.560]   It's sometimes it's hard to realize that if you put this inside a larger environment
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.520]   There might be an even simple way of doing it that only involves a the existing bluetooth chipset
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.840]   That's already inside every single phone and just simply a way of putting in support for a
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   Wireless authentication that is secure and is trustworthy and might be able to be used a device that you wear on your wrist as your authentication device
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   I don't know if anybody then they just steal your watch
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.080]   But I think that I think that what I would love I mean to build on what Andy's talking about is the ability to do
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.120]   You know, I can do my fingerprint. I could do a voice print. I could do I type in a code and everything in my house unlocks
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   You know like, you know, there's like, you know, three, you know, three layers. I love this bluetooth unlocking
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.640]   So when I get within my reanger my iMac this laptop you see it says you're unlocked my car
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.200]   And at home it unlocks
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.080]   Uh, but any other as soon as it's out of 30 feet range of this
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.680]   This was the feature actually on modo x I was one of the features that I was most excited about that I didn't hear a lot about in rumors
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.120]   People say what were you talking about?
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.320]   That was it. This procs the idea that it knows where it is in the proximity
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.920]   I was and that certainly isn't appropriate for every security situation. No, it's good enough for me though
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.840]   It's an interesting idea and yeah, it's good. It's good enough for me too. Yeah, I don't know if you know apple has
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.080]   Sorry, go ahead. We're pretty
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.560]   I was gonna say nine to five mac. I think had a video when they found a screen in apple tv that said, you know
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   Bring your iphone close for automatic setup
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.080]   So I don't think it's a technology that apple is foreign to it either right
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   So if we're not if we don't get fingerprints fingerprint scanning, what are the what are the tent pole?
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.720]   You know features that we're gonna see in a new phone. I mean because they have to have
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.480]   With they if they improve the camera two flashes two flashes
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.640]   Well, not just two flashes, but also an upgraded signal processor
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   I mean, I've been obviously I've been like just neck deep in camera phones for the past three or four weeks as I'm
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.680]   desperately trying to finish up this lumi 10 20 review, but so is it one way to improve it?
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.120]   I
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.480]   I'm finished, but now it's at the point of now I have to edit my photos
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.360]   And now I have to like talk to the web manager at the Sun time
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.120]   So you mean that I can't make a picture bigger than okay. I'll find a way to tell this story
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.880]   But but I'm doing lots and lots of side-by-side tests
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.880]   And the the damn thing is that for a phone that does not have the miraculous
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.640]   Stabilized lens it doesn't have the miraculous 41 megapixel limit sensor
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.360]   The iPhone 5 takes some damn fine pictures
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.680]   They kick it kicks it still kicks the butt of every other phone out there outside of the lumi 10 20
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.880]   And it's not as though the pictures that takes even with a side-by-side comparison with that really highly advanced
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.120]   optical technology that that Nokia has it's not as though it's
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.760]   Taking a ridiculously poor picture too
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.200]   So there's a lot of secret sauce involved in making a good phone camera and for apple
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   I really think the secret sauce is the signal processing when you I agree take one of these pictures
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.040]   And you see that wow, there's a lot of shadow detail that was not in any other any other picture
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.360]   it's doing the white balance is
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.680]   Tack perfect every single time it knows how to also knows how to make the colors a little bit wrong
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.960]   Just to make the picture look better without looking artificial
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.320]   There's a lot of secret sauce there and if all they do is keep the the same frame the same body
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.600]   But improve the improve the glass improve the processing and just create better pictures
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.840]   That's the sort of user facing feature that people immediately react
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.360]   I want to agree that low light still, you know, I think that there is rumors that they're going to a 2.2.0 aperture
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.640]   Yeah
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.400]   And I and I think that I think the only thing that matters at this point for these phones is low low light and and optical stabilization
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   You got some tough competition
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.520]   At the high end with the 10 20 and at the low end with the HTC one, which does amazing low light photography
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.160]   41 megapixels versus four megapixels is a big difference
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   but
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.480]   I think there is a it's not the entire market
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.640]   But there's a significant section of the market that does say what's the best camera phone?
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.840]   Well, because I think a lot of us I mean I have to admit that 90 percent of the phone
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.080]   I mean I have a I have a good SLR camera
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.760]   But 90 percent of the photos 95 percent of the photos that I take are with my iPhone
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.440]   You know and so that so you know that that is very important to me
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.200]   I mean and getting right and I'd be happy to pay more for a larger chip and better low light performance and not have shaky
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.800]   Camera photos every time I take them inside which still occurs
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.200]   It's that apertures if if they do go for the wetter aperture in a faster lens
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.480]   That's a big deal because every time that in these side-by-side shots. I see that the iPhone 5 failed
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.240]   It's almost always because it was forced to go for a longer shutter and so it's it's an okay picture
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.000]   It's fine for for instagram
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.560]   But in terms of something that you want as the only the last picture you took of your kids with the dog before the dog got killed
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.840]   That's not as good. I think and I would love to see larger chips
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.000]   Not necessarily more pixels but larger chips that gave us shorter depth of field and you know the CC one. Yeah. Yeah, so
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.520]   You guys may be skeptical maybe you're believers
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:19.840]   But the stock market is going crazy right now apple up 21 bucks today on news that carl icon has taken a large apple
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.000]   Steak, you know, I would I would I would sell if I found out that he was taking a
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:32.640]   Carl icon has come to ruin your company too. It's pretty you know pretty much obvious you buy in the rumor you sell on the news
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.120]   I'm on the business of I'm almost finished with del and then I will move on just phone number
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.240]   Yeah, so well, yeah, I can is the guy who comes in and becomes the the
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.880]   You know pro-chants investor. Yeah, he he defines, you know vulture
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.760]   He got he got there wasn't it. He's a yahoo that he got to completely change hp. I don't remember
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.600]   But anyway, um, yeah, I don't know what that means. I don't know what a large stake is
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.440]   I can only imagine if steve was still alive. He just call him and tell him to f off
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.640]   He said the tweet the tweet that came out the tweet that came out 11 21 this morning was
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.800]   We currently have a large position which is like 10 minutes ago or half an hour ago
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:16.640]   We currently have a large position and apple will believe the company to be extremely undervalued spoke to tim cook today more to come
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.520]   That's definitely the implication is I asked him. What are you announcing?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.040]   What is it that you're going to do that's going to make the iphone five s
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.720]   Take over the market and tim said something that carl i can whether he's smart. I don't know but
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.080]   Well tim's i'm not to say anything is he I don't think
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.760]   That would be called insider trading wouldn't it
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   Or is this unfair like you're supposed to announce to everyone at the same time if you're a public company
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.840]   So I don't think you can I can't say he met with tim cook on wednesday to push for a larger stock buyback
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.600]   It could be and we should point that out. Yeah, have nothing to do with technology
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.760]   Have everything to do with tim cook saying oh, yeah, we're gonna buy back more stock and I can't say good
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.560]   I want to get in on that right stock market doesn't really isn't that smart?
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.040]   When you see the news across the wire
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.720]   Somebody's taking a large position in apple. You just buy that's why it's up 21 bucks right now
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.240]   It's like the west wing leo, you know, I had drinks with sam seaborn last night
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.360]   No, sine would tell me anything but I had drinks right i'm seaborn last well and the other thing is is that the
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.800]   Someone savvy could announce that they did that and then you know
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.920]   Sumpened up. Yeah pumping dump it so
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:31.600]   I don't really like the stock market, but I just thought I'd pass that along as a data point probably a useless data point
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.040]   I cans the one is also keeping michael del from buying del so I know he goes with the money
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.560]   He's a bomber to keep busy with that would be yeah, yeah, bother steve would you please
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.320]   not enough volatility in the microsoft stock to make it worthwhile
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.880]   It'll be spuddy someplace else
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.680]   um
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   Let's take a break
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.880]   You guys look at our rundown see if there's something I guess we could talk about this since Alex is here
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.000]   Um, oh what am I getting one of a comment?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.360]   Well, I thought this blog post about the idea of what is a pro user? Oh, yeah, yeah, i'll talk about uh was interesting
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.760]   Ken seagull
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.240]   But first a word from legal zoom dot com legal zoom is not a law firm better
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.720]   Legal zoom helps you do the kind of legal work you can do very simply
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   without a lawyer very effectively
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.400]   And i'm going to give you an example from my own life
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.240]   The uh the corporation that runs to it the llc
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.880]   I set up in 2005
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.200]   I think it would I don't remember what legal zoom charged back then it's 99. I think it was lesser
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.080]   It's 99 bucks. It's cheap. I didn't need a white shoe lawyer. I didn't need anything
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.880]   I just went step by step through their simple questionnaire filled out the forms. I need filed it
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.200]   And we're still using that operating agreement, which is kind of cool. It's still working
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.640]   Still works fine and believe me now we have the law firm and it's a lot more expensive than legal zoom was
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.600]   She asked like that. That's like the cost of a call
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.200]   For like 10 minutes. No, no, no, no
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.640]   10 minutes. Maybe yeah, they charge they build by quarter hour increments. So it's no
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.520]   There's nothing I could I can't say hello to my lawyer for 99
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.640]   Seriously, yeah
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.200]   But don't get me started. That's why you want legal zoom incorporation as corp c corp
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.320]   You know, this is national will month. You have a will you have a will
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.120]   Uh, children you ought to have a will okay
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.080]   Even if you don't if you just have assets if you don't if you die in test state without a will
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.960]   How do how do your assets? How do your children? Uh get handled? Well the courts decide they say what's going to happen to it
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.640]   And they may not agree with what you thought you were going to do it may not be what you think
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.200]   Uh last wills are discounted 15
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.680]   Percent through the end of the month through the end of august
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.960]   Most people finish the online process in 20 minutes. It's easy. It's that easy
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.280]   Well, the big thing is even if you're gonna someday do something more complicated. It's just worth putting something down
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.240]   That's how I felt with the LLC although here we are eight years later
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:02.160]   Not exactly your will is state specific. It's not just some form that you check boxes on and no no no no
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.440]   It's state specific. It's completely personalized based on your information
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   They've they've been doing this for 12 years. They know how to do it
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.480]   It is national make a will month, which I think actually is pretty important

[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.760]   You could be that one day. I mean one and then you weren't looking because no buses. I've never seen a bus
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.200]   That's terrible

[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.120]   Trusts are not expensive either by the way

[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.200]   Um
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.760]   I liked I don't know if you did you read this uh, Alex? I did kensigal is a creative director
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:14.880]   Uh, he's worked at apple and next he says I took a blood oath to uphold the principle of simplicity
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.360]   He wrote insanely simple the obsession that drives apple success and he's talking about
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.080]   apples evolving view of what a pro is
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.760]   Uh, and you know, of course he's restating the obvious they haven't updated the pro in a long time in fact
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.400]   Even the mac mini has had thunderbolt for two years, but not the mac pro. It's due
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.160]   He talks about the fact that there's no more 17 inch mac book pro
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.560]   The changes to final cut the fact that aperture hasn't been updated. It's in well
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.280]   It's been updated, but the last version was released february 2010. I didn't even realize that
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.680]   It's been out there. Not a lot of attention paid to this
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.560]   Here's the thing that I find fascinating
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:58.240]   He says steve jobs did in fact once consider abandoning the pro market
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.000]   This is not the first time this discussion has been had back when the iMac
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.200]   Was huge during one of the agencies regular meetings with steve. He said he was considering killing the pro
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.680]   Products and it's what we've been saying for a long time the consumer products have an unlimited upside
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.560]   While the pro products consume major resources, but it's a niche a tiny market
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.840]   Um steve did in fact renew his commitment to the pros realizing that
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.720]   It's really important pros are opinion leaders influencers
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.680]   Which they found out when they you know change final cut and everything else
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:36.480]   Damage how quickly you can end up on konin a lot of people when the editors at konin are upset so
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.360]   So I definitely think that there is a
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.440]   the
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.360]   I mean I think that
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:50.560]   There's a couple things one is is that the what is a pro what what pros need and what is a pro has changed dramatically over the last 10 years
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.000]   I think that apple definitely moved away from the pro pro market
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.440]   So I I'm remember back in the days of shake when you know, we had a very high-end compositor that apple owned
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   um that
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   You know that apple decided to move away from and eventually, you know open source and then just kill
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.720]   um
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.760]   The they I think there was a lot of interest that apple had in 3d
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.720]   I mean before the iMac really took off. I mean apple really looked at that as their their pro market as their
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   um kind of
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.000]   Lifeblood, you know before the iPod before the eye, you know before those are the people that were willing to spend extra
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.640]   for for hardware. I think that
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.480]   I think that the big reason that we saw a long delay in the
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:34.800]   The Mac pro was obviously when we saw its release is that apple, you know was thinking different
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:41.680]   I don't know whether we all agree with it yet, but um, but you know there was a obviously there was an enormous amount of
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.440]   redesign. It wasn't just simply upgrading and adding a couple little bits and pieces
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:53.200]   um, so I think that that was um there I I I actually don't I just finished doing a long edit over the weekend in final cut 10
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.600]   and um
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.680]   There was a moment where I thought you know was really complicated and I thought maybe I would use final cut 7
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   And I actually opened up final cut 7 for the first time in a long time and I was like, oh my gosh
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.760]   I can't believe I used to use this
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.920]   It was so ugly, you know, and I went back to final cut 10. I spent the next, you know the weekend
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.360]   They are doing it. I can't even I don't even know how I would do the edit that I did in final cut 10 and in mac in final cut 7
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:20.080]   So I don't even know how I would do it in premiere. I mean it was just very complex and so the
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.040]   And because of the way that I can nest things and everything else, uh, it was just a lot easier
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.320]   So so I I don't think that apple necessarily I think when it first came out final cut 10 was really
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.000]   um
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.200]   Was behind and I think at this point I think that people are still relating to its first day is not where it is now
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.920]   Um, I think that when we see I can't I strongly believe that when we when the new final cut when the new mac pro comes out
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:50.160]   I think we're going to see a new final cut or new. I think a lot of these we pro apps are going to be upgraded to take
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.440]   Take full advantage of those and I think that at that point you see once again this kind of marrying of
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.960]   Hardware and software that we haven't seen apple do well for a while
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:04.720]   Um where the where the technical specs of of the of the hardware match up with the software requirements, you know
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.480]   Perfectly, you know, I'm gonna say I have a savings account for my mac pro
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.720]   And you might want to start one too. There's been a little discussion over what this might cost
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.120]   We're leasing them
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:22.480]   Lots of them so an on tech had a price list for the v2 e5 zions that apple has already announced they're going to use
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.880]   You're talking to grand for the processor
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.440]   And and what are the things marco armont writes in this blog post about this that came out yesterday or day before yesterday is
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.840]   um
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.520]   That clocks you got a balance and you know this
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.080]   You know for a lot of what you do
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.640]   Clock speed raw clock speed is very very very important
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.920]   Having multiple cores is great for rendering and so forth
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.840]   But if you have a throughput and but it's all and what uh, you know a lot of intel chips are slower
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:57.920]   Like look what's in this a slower clock speed in my mac book air are slower clock speeds more cores
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.680]   Uh, but you're hitting the thermal wall here as you get over three gigahertz in fact intel's yet to do a four gigahertz
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:10.720]   Process they've they've really said we cannot and yet many pro apps would like a the fastest clock speed possible
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.560]   um
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.840]   So, uh, if you look at the price list we're talking
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   anyway
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   For an eight core 3.3 gig
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.400]   Uh
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.240]   88 bucks per giga hertz is 2000. This is the processor and quantity by the way
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.560]   Not looking at you came one of the storm bought one. This is you know buying lots of whatever 10 000
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.160]   2321 bucks for the processor
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   Marco thinks that we're gonna start at 3,500 bucks for the base model mac pro
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:48.240]   I wouldn't be surprised. Probably but I don't know why you bother like so as an apple if you're gonna build a pro machine
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.480]   Especially if it's not upgradable you're gonna
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.520]   I mean not like not in the same way that we would normally see up upgradable
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.440]   You know, why would you bother making a computer that's less than 3500?
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.520]   $100 when most people like you can run an ima 27 inch entry level
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.040]   Yeah for a cpu that makes the mac pro barrier worth crossing
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.520]   $5,000 in up. Yeah
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.880]   I know the hell's gonna buy that
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.000]   Um people forget the effect was was $11,000
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.040]   Yeah, and you know what the FX stood for and a lot of people's lexicon was fracked too fracking expensive
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.840]   And i'd be in generous on the frack
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   And it was awesome one of the reasons I went to the pro
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.440]   2 FX they we had a whole lab of them. They were brand new installed when I toured the the program
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:34.560]   I went to cal poly sinless a bespoke for printing and they were pre-pressed machines and we had you know
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.240]   All that stuff and it was it was I admit I I bought it to FX
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.440]   I only I could only afford the 2ci for 6,000
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:47.520]   Yeah, I have a 2 FX motherboard on my wall in a frame. That's how much point is people bought them
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.560]   And so I mean if you do the math it seems to me like pro machines have kind of just been pro machines
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.440]   That the pricing that they they're at for forever
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.520]   And the thing is is that is that when you when you're doing it as a pro
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:04.240]   The big thing you're you're not paying attention to the cost of the hardware your paying attention to the cost of the labor
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.360]   And so the thing is is that labor adds up really fast
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.280]   You know and so the thing is is that what you're you know someone being 5 or 10 or 15 faster at what they do
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.680]   You know over a month, you know will pay for you know a lot of times the delta between two pieces of hardware
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.600]   Definitely over a year and so so that that's the thing that you know
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.320]   The math is much different than when you're buying at home and when you're buying at home
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.840]   You're not getting paid to play games when you're when you're working on it. You're getting paid per hour
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.000]   This could be a great gaming machine
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:40.080]   You know it's gonna you know but but I think that for us, you know, we just you know, there's a handful of of tools
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.800]   We don't need all of them. I mean we're still we have tons of
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.880]   You know iMacs. I mean we you know the school in Rwanda that we have is 40 iMac 27 and jimax
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   We've got probably 15 of them here
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.480]   And for most people in the office the iMac 27 inches plenty and for everybody else the retina
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.560]   15 inches or plenty
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.360]   But there are there's a handful of things that we do that we would love to you know buy
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   Um these machines for
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.720]   And I think that we're not the only ones it's not just the machine
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.040]   I mean they're gonna be dropping five grand on the machine plus a display plus a raid system, you know a thunderbolt raid
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.000]   In your tuck in 10 11 grand, but I know non-sex said we're talking a small a Hyundai
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.600]   You could buy a Hyundai for this well we you know we but even with the old one
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.720]   We budgeted when we were building them the budget in our off in our office was 12 000 per mac pro
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:33.520]   And that was to be rigged out the way that we needed to be for production like if we're gonna not
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.840]   Most of our computers are iMacs. So the thing you know most of our productions on iMacs
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:43.360]   But if we're gonna get a mac pro for 3d for heavy-duty editing for compositing, you know
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:49.360]   The budget was 12 grand, you know and and um we bought them carefully slowly, you know
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.040]   We didn't spend a we didn't have a lot of them. We definitely have a lot more iMacs to do that
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.080]   I can't wait to get one. Yeah, but i'm gonna play games on it just to show you
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.960]   Did I am in the 1%
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:06.400]   I'm gonna they're in stare at it. I'm gonna just it'll be my home theater pc
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.960]   It's coming to my home
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   You see that cylinder there that costs more than my car
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.360]   Like a pizlio
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:20.080]   This is this is why this is why my golf clubs are combination of clubs that I inherited for my uncle when I was 11 years old
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.480]   Clubs that I found on the course and clubs that I've bought at building 19 one by one as I needed them because I don't like
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.040]   It's enough hard work for me to just to rise to a level of confidence and why choose to do
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.280]   If i'm going to be intimidated by the tools with which i'm going to use it and saying oh
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.720]   Nice. So you have a three thousand dollar set of clubs and that's what you're doing with them
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.480]   Oh
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   I'm that guy
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.560]   The engineers that ping would kill themselves knowing what you just did with that with that that that that's saying shot
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.080]   I want a unifying thermal coal and i'm going to pay any amount to get it
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.720]   Uh, it'll be great on my yacht
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   um
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.280]   And after after being a curmudgeon, I have to say that the uh
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.040]   Um when birk was walking around I can think with tape, you know
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.600]   With the tape thing of like this is how big it's gonna be and I realized I could fit a whole bunch of them into 1650
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.120]   Pelican case. I was like, okay, they're not that bad, you know
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.920]   It's gonna be really hard for me to buy this. I'm gonna I want it desperately
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.200]   It won't be no
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.560]   It's the closest thing to sex that a computer could possibly be
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:28.320]   Um and yet it's gonna be I mean we just got now are they get they're not gonna announce this september
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   This is the october announcement, right?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.120]   Uh, gotta be
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.200]   I know you're gonna announce this so it's gonna be just the release i mean release it. Yeah, i'm a glass
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.240]   Dear, I mean they can get real close to when will they when will they have it out?
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.480]   January december when
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.160]   Order is being taken by the end of this year and by the way, i'm i'm while i'm very excited about it
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.320]   I would highly recommend not being the first one on the i am not gonna be the first one to buy this
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.600]   This is anytime apple builds an entirely new structure
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:02.240]   I have never seen one come out where there isn't some weird. Oh, right the uh, the glue on the chip it burns
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.600]   There's smoke wait wait until the first three fire investigators figure out figured out what went wrong and then wait for
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.200]   With hardware updates with apple. It's always point one just wait for point one
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.960]   You know, you just just you know, they're okay. I had a two days somebody's gotta buy it first
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.640]   Yeah, there we go. I will buy I mean here's the deals we'll buy one because we want to test it
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.840]   But we're not gonna we're not gonna buy it because we have to refuse it right of course and i would invite you over
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:32.800]   I will with the jamma party you and i can play we'll play with it play games on on our our test our test
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.080]   Now our review units somebody was saying the chairman. I think this is probably true
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.840]   You don't just announce this you have to announce a new thunderbolt thunderbolt monitor
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.320]   Possibly 4k because it's worse work. You don't have to but it'd be nice. You would be you have to
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.720]   Why not look if you're gonna take if you're gonna take people's money take it all
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.240]   You know traditionally they've gone to better monitors for the iMac first and then
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.120]   Carry them down to the thunderbolt. We interesting to see if they want to go thunderbolt first this time and then bring them over
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.280]   Don't you think in some ways this is a flagship? You know don't don't car companies do this
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.280]   They build a car nobody can afford
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.480]   You know, but that's the car you look at and you go that must be a good company
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.720]   I think i'll buy like I can't afford a cobra, but i'm gonna buy a mustang
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.640]   Like everyone comes in everyone comes into the apple store to look at the the new mak pro and then they buy an iMac
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.720]   Okay, don't you think you trick this out you make this be you don't you don't even look at price
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.600]   Tim Cook says you don't just do this this and this i don't want to see how much it's gonna cost just do it
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.760]   And then that's the one you have one in every mac apple store people come and go
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.880]   And some no nutcases buy it
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.080]   But most of the time, I mean, I don't know who's gonna buy this is kind of so expensive again. They do
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.320]   There's a lot though
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.280]   They they they they they'll they'll make they'll make one model of something that's the first time you've seen anything like this
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.800]   And it's ungodly outrageously expensive, but then three or four years later
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   They figure out which features need to trickle down into like the mainstream line
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.680]   Or ways to make this into a productive thing like the the like the difference between the macbook air
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:04.000]   Between a staview and now being the the true vokes machine. I remember literally pressing my nose against the glass
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.800]   Looking at elisa and thinking
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.480]   $10,000 but wanting it so bad
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.240]   And you better believe when the 2500 buck mac guitar came out two years later. I bought it
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.200]   Within the first month, right?
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.520]   So it really does it's a good thing to do for a company whether they have to make very many of them. I don't know
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.080]   There's a thing is
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.880]   Another thing is the apple really is a company that has to keep making machines like this
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:36.240]   They have to keep maintaining their position as the company that's keeping that's doing the next stuff that you're gonna
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.120]   Want any year from now or two years from now or three years from now?
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:46.560]   Because if they'll ever allow themselves to be dragged down to street level with every other manufacturer and just be another manufacturer of
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.520]   Very very practical for the 80 percent of users out there laptops and desktops
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.160]   A lot of people are going to say well, why not? I why don't I see if they're making very ordinary machines?
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.120]   Why don't I just say $400 and buy the exact same?
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:06.880]   Configuration only in a windows machine. So this right even if even if this does not become like that that part of the revenue chart that
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.680]   Is noticeably thicker than any then then then cables and and iPod accessories
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:18.000]   It'll have that role of making apple keeping apples reputation as here's here's how clever these
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.440]   These young men and women in middle-aged men and women and occasionally old men and women at this company are they can make things
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:30.240]   That work that work like spit as fast as that and look as cool as this nobody there's nobody could make this besides apple
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.400]   Nobody wants to make this besides apple. That was true. You know, what's that?
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.840]   They're rather great. That's the link the link router. That's a router
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   Yeah
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.400]   It looks just like an apple. It's only 200 bucks. Maybe I'll just buy that instead
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.760]   Well, you do a lot of routing not a lot of gaming but a lot of routing
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.200]   I can get that ethernet connected into you is designed to go with the Mac Pro or just to steal it
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.840]   Because it looks just like the Mac Pro
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.320]   Wow, where do I get that?
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.160]   That's only 200 bucks. That suddenly seems very cheap. Well, and again
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:10.960]   I think that when we when when we talk about operations that are labor intensive that will be spit out spit out by a faster computer
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.280]   I mean this stuff becomes you know, it really balances out pretty quickly. There's a pretty large market for that
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:21.040]   You know, it's not I mean, it's it's not going to be the same market as the iPod or the i you know, iPhone or the iMac
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.680]   But it's large enough to it. I think it'll be a profit
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:30.000]   It's it and it also serves the very important point to get back to this original blog post by Ken Segal of
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.600]   Saying yes, we have a pro product. Yep. And in a in a in a no compromise pro product
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.280]   No, like we didn't just give you something off the back of the truck that that you know, we think is okay
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.480]   We designed something from the ground. It had been a lot of fun to be it is the
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.960]   The engineer the the engineer team engineering team that got to build that is like yeah
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.680]   There's no real cost limits or anything else just you know, make it as cool as you can
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:57.920]   Wouldn't you love to see the see the the sketches where they looked at it and said no that design is too out there
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.400]   Let's do something sensible like a black cylinder
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:11.120]   Any surprises anyone more thing on this in the September or October announcement?
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:17.440]   Well, I think we're expecting retinum mini and that would be a good one. I think
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.800]   That won't be so the timbers far as I don't think so
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:27.680]   They haven't said anything about iPods yet last year it was iPhones and iPod in the same event and then October was ipads and max
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.640]   And they have those four things now and they could theoretically mix and match depending on what's ready and when
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:39.920]   But you know, there's no word on iPods yet. Maybe iPods and then iPads and max maybe in October
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:46.320]   And don't and don't forget the iOS iOS 7 is going to be as big a deal in September as anything else
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:52.720]   The first because again, it's it's a way for everybody who thinks that they know what the what the iPhone is as an opportunity
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.200]   They're gonna invite them in to say no you you have not seen it yet. You this is a total reinvention
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.760]   While while maintaining a lot of the equity that we've had we've built over the past six years
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.800]   Uh, and I think that if there's a reason for apple not to overload the september event with more with without of the box
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   You know out of category stuff like we're not going to see here's the new iphone
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.560]   Oh, and by the way, here's here's a progress report on the on the new mac pro
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.680]   I think they're gonna it's gonna be as much about iOS 7 as anything else
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   But I can see I can see yeah, I can see the ipad the ipads and the iphone all going out in one group because they want to talk about ios 7
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   You know, I could see that all happening in one event
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.080]   Alex had asked, you know what those pillars were for the iphone five s launch
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.400]   And I think for sure huge one is ios 7
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.840]   Uh just the software and the oh, yeah, there's been a lot of time on that
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.080]   I'm wondering if i you know the rumor is apple spending an incredible amount of money on the maps
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.880]   So it'll be interesting to see if they show us an update with a lot more
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:54.320]   Act out they didn't I think I was I was gonna just simply say this but I think that i'm actually quoting rene from a few weeks ago
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.640]   When those when those things were an ace has something I think damn it
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.960]   I if I'd gotten another half hour to think about it
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.560]   I would have thought of something as clever as that too
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.080]   But I will I will I will give rene the proper quotation that apple run
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.160]   We're writing us that apple does usually hold something back from the developer release
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.600]   That's either isn't ready yet or needs an extra context or they really just want to have something cool to show off in september
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.160]   So i'm curious to see what's in ios 7 that
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.360]   Hasn't been seen yet or hasn't been discovered by people who pour over the source files
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.760]   Charlie rose got in a plane flew to uh silicon valley to talk to larry ellison the ceo and found our voracle
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:35.280]   One of the richest men in the world he's roughing it at larry's place roughing it at the larry doesn't leave the place so uh, so charlie is not in his kimono
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   And I always thought charlie was a great interviewer but i'm gonna say this was one of the worst interviews ever
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.600]   Uh also miss somewhat misrepresented because uh the headline said larry ellison says apple is doomed
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.480]   Without jaws
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.440]   We saw apple with steve jobs
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.000]   Now we're gonna see apple without steve jobs what what he says which is true and we all know we've observed many times that we already
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.160]   He says we've already done the experiment look how apple did without steve jobs the first time
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.880]   Um, but on follow-up
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.240]   Uh, he doesn't say apple is doomed by any means
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.800]   Also much different company than it was yeah
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.960]   And uh, and i don't think that that's fair to say apple larry sees dark future or anything out of the sort
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.400]   Um, he was a very carefully chosen clip and it completely lacks context because steve jobs was forced out of apple the first time
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.720]   Uh his favorite sugar water salesman took over and then he eventually went back now he left apple
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.520]   He built up an entire culture there you'd hired tim cook and johnny i haven't well he didn't hire
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.440]   But he brought johnny i after the position he's in today and he trained apple apple is and i think groover said this a year ago
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.560]   apple is steve jobs biggest product and
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.000]   That was not absolutely not the case when steve jobs left the first time
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.200]   Um, but the thing that i'm curious about most leo is that why we spend so much time paying attention to people who
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.360]   I mean he was steve jobs his friend, but his claim to fame is being smart enough to sell amongst the worst database
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.280]   Ever to everybody right and i'm not sure what particular insight that gives
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.760]   Yeah, exactly well, but he did spend time in fact the thing that's worth watching the interview for is
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   Him talking about
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.040]   The last days of steve he said i used to go you know every week we'd take a walk the walks got shorter and shorter eventually steve
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.560]   couldn't take the walk and a few days before he passed away
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.880]   Uh steve and i did not know this uh stop taking his medication. He said he basically gave up
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   He said i'm too much pain. It's not worth it. He said he's one of the street was one of the strongest
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:34.320]   Fighters i knew and when steve couldn't take it anymore then you really knew it was over
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:42.320]   Um that is worth watching the rest of it who cares what larry ellison thinks he also says that uh and is so amazing because
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.120]   First of all larry never gives interviews so the fact that he gave an interview it all becomes much more important than it ought to be
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.240]   But secondly he says uh he's quoted as saying
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.280]   Uh larry page is evil he's actually very careful not to say that larry page is evil. He's just pissed off that uh that
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:03.040]   That you know they're suing him over java that the right and roid isn't uh licensing java for moracle
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.040]   That's but he's very careful to say no he's not evil and i don't think you know
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:14.000]   It's all reading but between the lines to say that apple is doomed you saw the thing he went up with apple without steve he went down
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.120]   And now they we saw apple without steve jobs up and then now we're to see apple without steve jobs
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.120]   But it's but he doesn't say doomed by any means i think what what it remains is we don't know what's going to happen
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.920]   Um and i think for the verge and others to say apple is doomed larry ellison says apple is doomed is misquoting him
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.880]   Oh it's good it got it got people to look at it got us to talk about it
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.600]   Yeah, and i might i might say that uh that uh
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.360]   It could have been a better interview, but frankly it couldn't have gotten more attention so
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.400]   Because that's what your goal is
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.520]   It certainly did get a lot of attention
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.120]   Anything else we want to talk about before we get go to a break and get our picks of the week
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.160]   I don't think it's interesting though leon i don't think it's not totally fair
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.880]   But steve jobs has claimed to fame was taking amazing technologies and mainstream them so that everybody could benefit
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.240]   Where some companies and i won't mention any names, but they might have just been interviewed
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.520]   We might have just talked about them
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.000]   It's claimed to fame was was stomping smaller companies with better technology so they never hit the mainstream
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.320]   And i think if you look at it and ask for the dichotomy
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   It's really interesting that apple is carrying on steve jobs
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.480]   Legacy of bringing new technologies to market fast and not just buying or destroying small companies that have really clever ideas
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.440]   They bought authentic we might see authentic now faster in the mainstream than we might otherwise have seen it
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.680]   They didn't you know decide oh a pin code is better known to ever know that biometrics exists
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.000]   And yes for those folks who are on time Warner who didn't get to see the charlie rose interview you didn't miss a thing
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.480]   Feel better
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:48.160]   Well, you know what you missed was his excellent face work. I thought that the the plastic surgery is really really gunwell for him
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.080]   Um, that's about have we have we talked about?
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.560]   apples $10 i iPhone power supply replacement program
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.280]   No, we haven't of course this all started because a woman in china and it's unclear what the
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.360]   What the truth is in this story
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.760]   But the story in china was plugged in her i phone or had a rifone charging on a stock iphone charger with a stock iphone
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.440]   That she bought at the apple store picked it up and electrocuted herself to death when it rang
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.240]   Um, and apple did apologize. Although i don't know if there were to blame
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.040]   It's just as likely that there were bad chargers that looked like apple chargers
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.040]   Um, so what are they doing are they are they offering to replace all of them?
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.400]   Um, if you walk into an apple store after
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:37.120]   Uh, august 16th with a third party charger and give them 10 bucks that will swap it for an apple one
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.480]   That's great. So if you were stupid enough to buy
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.360]   They're trying to get guns off the off the street. Yeah. Yeah
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.400]   Yeah, because these priority chargers don't for instance one of the real problems with lithium ion is you have to stop
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.400]   Charging and now actually the phone would do that
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.760]   Probably but you have to stop charging it once it gets full otherwise it will explode or at least burst of the flight
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.520]   I have had theories that some of the third party ones that I use that charge my phone really fast have decreased the overall
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.360]   That may be also true battery power of mine
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.120]   Your fast charging is not good for the phone
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.560]   The other issue was probably that charger had a short circuit because you you're not gonna get and in china
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.880]   I think it's 220 volts, which is certainly enough to kill you
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.320]   You're not gonna get 220 over a usb charger unless there's some sort of
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   Shorten to say that's gonna leave a mark
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.240]   So good for apple. Yeah, if you have a third party charger if you were foolish enough to buy one
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:29.120]   Yeah, I have third party chargers in fact. I don't like exactly. I was like I have a lot of other
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.000]   And then once we recommended on this show over the past couple of years
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:32.480]   I know I
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.640]   Oh, yeah, come to think of it. I never use apple chargers
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.960]   Because they only have one they only have one
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.400]   A couple of mermaids I don't know if they're talking about chargers or talking about ac adapters which the pictures all show ac adapters
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.320]   Hey, see you know, what's that? Oh, well, I mean not not not the ten watt not the ten watt brick
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.280]   But the one that you get free with an iPhone. Yes, that doesn't play doesn't have an
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.840]   Oh, yeah, that that that we call we're calling that the charger the thing with the usb port
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.240]   I think we're talking about mophies which were no no no no that right there
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.440]   um
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.920]   But I mean, yeah, I don't I mean I have a couple of the apple ones. I never use I don't buy any of them
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.320]   I mean, you know, it's just because they don't I think it is sensible not to buy
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   apple chargers on ebay
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.760]   Right, uh, you know get them from a reliable retailer preferably with a reliable name
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.400]   The ones we've recommended all have been reliable and are unlikely to electrocute you
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.720]   Also, also apple has a certification program for right for iphone adapt for any iphone product
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.480]   So if you bought like a griffin adapter, it's probably okay
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.000]   And it's probably worth more than the than the adapter that your bum swap your 40 dollar multi port griffin
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.120]   Power dock adapter for yeah
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.520]   But yeah, if if there's a free put it this way if there's a flea market nearby and you see a whole bunch of like two dollar
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.920]   Chinese off brand iphone chargers. Yeah, turns out that maybe worth it
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.080]   Do any of you actually out of curiosity unplug your phone before you answer it pick it up?
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.760]   No, uh, no
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.240]   Sometimes sometimes i plug it in with the charger. I don't people sometimes I plug it in to answer because it's dead
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.200]   So it's like, oh, I gotta plug this in quickly
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.200]   And it's also it's a nice bit of nostalgia back then when we were little children
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.720]   And we had a pick up the phone and there was a wire on the back of bottom of it
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.760]   I know
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.840]   The red car costs just a nickel and coax for 50 cents in glass bottom
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.920]   We got one of those
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.840]   You've seen those you've seen those those ones that are a handset that you you pop into your, um
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.480]   phone
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.680]   I looked over my son my son had that
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.840]   Yeah, and I couldn't figure out why because he's no he wasn't it was outside of the time that he's allowed to use the
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.080]   The phone, but he could so he figured out that if he plugged it in he could play he could play field runners
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.880]   And so he's sitting there. It looks like he's talking like
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.360]   Playing field runners and you know over in the corner and I was
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.000]   I was like he's a scary boy
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.920]   You have to admit that the cradle was a better shape than this that kind of is slappin glass. It's not a great shape
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.960]   No, well, I don't usually put it up to my head though. I mean I

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.480]   If I look at the controller
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.880]   Okay, I can't I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm I'm gonna turn into an eight-year-old
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   I'm sorry
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.040]   Let's start with anti-anaco. He's a much more mature person his pick
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.880]   Of the wing when it's such a practical and functional item that we don't spend a whole lot of time using we just this all
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.440]   anyway, uh
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.360]   I'm just saying west coast east guy. I think you're right. That's all I'm saying
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.440]   Uh
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.560]   Really cool
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.480]   Pretty cool item from uh cable jive.com this unassuming little thing is called the dock boss air
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.720]   And all it is is has see it has an old-fashioned
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.280]   iPhone ipod style dock connector, uh, and it is a bluetooth
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.080]   Audio transfer transfer. So I've been you know, I've tried a bunch of the cheap off brand ones
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.880]   They didn't work that well. So this works. Yeah, and this and this this works fine
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.840]   So if you're if you if you spend a few hundred dollars on a really nice dock
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.320]   That's the speakers are still great. Yeah, this cost 35 bucks. You put it in here you pair it
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.040]   With your phone just our device just like any other blue
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.800]   And so it'll just turn it to a turn it into a bluetooth ready speaker system
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.680]   Now does that work with uh, do you know with the sonos
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.960]   Dock I don't I don't know that it works with the sonos it works. It's it's it's why my ipod high-fi is still
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.760]   Uh, it's still a useful item here in my office, uh, because i still use my high-fi
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:21.200]   It's it's it's a really great speaker, but it was so it was such a pain in the butt to like have to walk over and actually plug in
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   A device to actually make it to work
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.240]   There was also a few years ago. I got
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.960]   After they made the first change to the dock connector
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.920]   They made sort of like a elevator stand that was like a few inches high that if you sort of
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:40.160]   Wanted to balance your your old style dock phone on the top, but you could still make it work with the ipod high-fi
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.240]   Uh, but this is i've used it with like three or four different, uh, three or four different dock. Excuse me
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   This is from cable jive
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.760]   Cable jive.com
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   Cable jive
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.080]   I just bought one
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.280]   I'll let you know if it works with the sonos because that would be because right now what I you know sonos doesn't even make the dock anymore
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.280]   Because they didn't want to make a lightning dock
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.240]   So, uh, but I I have to have an adapter that goes from my iphone five into the
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.280]   The dock, but it'd be really nice if I just do a via bluetooth
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.360]   It's it's it's work with almost everything everything i've tried i have i do have to correct myself
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.320]   I don't know why i said i guess i guess i just want to say something un un kind about the ipod high-fi
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.800]   I've not i have not tried it with the ipod high-fi
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.120]   I have what i've used it with like all the different dock connectors that a dock speakers
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.720]   I've had in the first and past two or three years
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.960]   It says it works for the bows sound doc another ipod and iphone audio docks including i-home
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.720]   Bose sound doc jbl logitex sony and others so I bet you would it works with everything right and you'll find well because
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.120]   Remember the first the remember the first uh ipod high-fi
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.120]   Because it has the old style connector it wouldn't power certain devices
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.480]   So I will not promise you that it works with this because i i have not tried it
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.160]   I have enough juice to uh because that's a little radio drive it may not work
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.240]   But again, it has it does work with the bows that I have it does work with the i-home
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.040]   Dock that I have as a way that would be so cool. It would also make it possible for me to use
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.040]   My android device with my 30 pin dock
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:12.720]   Yeah, and it will and will also yeah, I mean that the the the the information page here also indicates that
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:20.240]   if you just plug it into uh any sort of like a dock adapt excuse me any sort of like a cable style dock adapter
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   It will also just simply give the bluetooth audio to any device that will work with a a uh old style
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.800]   A cable connector. I have not tried that myself again. This is just a way to you know
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.200]   You get this thing that cost you 185 you know four years ago and it's still a good speaker
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.200]   You just can't use it with your current phone
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.160]   But just now you just put this put this in the guest room put this in the office put this in the kitchen now you have a work
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.920]   That would be so handy for me. Yeah. Well, good. I'll let you know if it works with the sonos. I bet it does
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   Adam christurts and maccast.com the granddaddy of the macintosh podcasts
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.520]   This is amazing. CZ such a young guy. You know what I didn't ask you adam. I meant to
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.760]   Do you are you still in touch with your friends? Nick? Nick of course and ik software got purchased well by google
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:08.640]   Uh because the snap seed app was so great and they are now giving away the nick plug-ins, which is so cool
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.800]   Yeah
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:18.000]   Are they all happy there? Are they still there? Well, the salespeople aren't so happy. Yeah, because there's no money to be made
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.600]   Yeah, well, and I don't know that um a lot of those people
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.240]   Transitioned. I'm not really close. I was already out of the company when that whole thing went down
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.600]   So I knew some people there people moved on and general everybody's really happy. I mean the engineers are all over there
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.680]   It's great for consumers obviously
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:39.760]   I they're not free. I apologize 150 bucks though for the full collection. Yeah, they're huge
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Sweet, which I think used to be upwards of
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.560]   506 bucks if I remember from when I was there is now like 150
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.360]   Yep, but you got they made snap seed free, which I absolutely love my favorite photo editor
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.320]   I guess that could be the bonus pick. I'm sure it's been picked before though
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.120]   Um, that's what I use for editing all my photos on my iOS devices and just really great technology. I mean that the
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   Selective color correction technology that they have in there something they called upoint is really the secret sauce to all of their stuff
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.720]   so
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:15.680]   Good acquisition. That's not your pick. So that is not my pick. I'm going
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.760]   I wanted to go Mac and I wanted to go
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.040]   With something that I knew hadn't been picked. So I went pretty specific. I dipped into my own background
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.800]   So I mentioned earlier. I'm a programmer. I don't remember if that was pre-show or not
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.880]   but I do web development and
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.920]   Source control is always an important thing
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.200]   And something I wasn't doing and I got into about a year ago
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:42.000]   Um, I had tried different systems and I ended up using a system called git gi t because it's built in to your max
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.480]   It actually works with xcode and um, but I wasn't really happy
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.520]   I use github which is a service that lets you have your repository where you store all of your
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.080]   Change file information and stuff like that
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.200]   um, and they have a little application that's great for
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:04.240]   You know managing your repository and checking things in and out while it's not technically checking things in and out but people get the point
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.480]   Um, but I wanted something a little more robust. You can do all this from the command line
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.840]   I'm also a terminal guy
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.680]   So I was perfectly happy to do it from the command line, but I like a nice gooey
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.800]   And so I was looking for something and I ran across tower
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.360]   Uh, which is for
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.320]   managing your git repositories and it integrates with all of the services so
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:31.440]   github being stock it, you know, you just plug into your repository and you can manage your
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.880]   code both remotely and your local repos
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:41.680]   your Prozzetories and it just is amazing and it's got this great visual interface. So I know what's going on
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   Uh, two big features that I was looking for that I didn't find in the github app what was um
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:54.720]   Stashing I didn't like how you could stash code for people who know what that is and then also
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.560]   um, I wanted to be able to rebase which is a different sort of way of
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:05.760]   Different philosophy from merging which are kind of two ways to bring your code back together when you branch off code to say work on a new
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:11.600]   Feature or a new release and you need to bring that code back into the into the main code base. So
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.360]   This sounds great. I I've just used the command line get and this sounds so much better
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.520]   Yeah, and I mean
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.680]   Programmers use git and but I know writers who use it to keep to keep you know
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.040]   Back of just the stuff that they write. That's funny when I was going to collaborate in a book
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.560]   Uh, jina Smith and I were going to use that it will get that exist svn
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.360]   To do that to keep track of our revisions and so forth
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:39.280]   Yeah, and it's a little less relevant now because ostan has versions and it's pretty much i'm not entirely positive
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.520]   They're not leveraging get under the hood somewhere. I've never fell that deep into it
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.040]   But probably not that and i've often wondered because it's it's there in ostan, you know, it's in the core
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.480]   So why not?
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:56.800]   And you could use this with github so uh, you could store it in that github as well. Yeah, that's what that's literally what I do
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.400]   I also do a lot of just local stuff
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.440]   So when i'm lurking on little projects or little sandbox things that i'm trying out
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.280]   I like to keep track of my revisions so that you know if something goes wrong you're testing something out
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.920]   You just want to roll back to something it makes it super easy
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.880]   I mean you're literally just right click and like okay go back to this revision
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.640]   And I can get back to where I was and I don't lose code and you maintain it and
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.880]   You can pull bit some pieces out
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.240]   It was always bad because you know, you know, you do that thing where you'd have multiple files
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.280]   So I used to have the system where I'd have dot old and dot older and dot oldest so I could go back
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]   But this takes care of all of that so
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:35.760]   Thank you madam. That was great to have you on the show at maccast.com as somebody who's in the chat room the very first mac podcast I ever listened to
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.920]   Yeah, great. It's been a long time. We're still here leo when you start
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.440]   Uh 2004. Oh, yeah, you beat me by here
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.760]   Yeah
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.040]   Very nice
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.240]   ladies and gentlemen mr. Renee ritchie's pick of the week
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.920]   I am picking disney animated which is an ipad app. It came out on the weekend
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.360]   It's so awesome when I was a kid
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.920]   I had my mother had this book that giant dungsen dragon style tome that had
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.800]   Page after page of all how they made all the original disney sell animated movies
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.040]   And I must have read read it thousands of times it was one of my favorite books
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.360]   And so this weekend I saw louie manti at tweeting about this app and I immediately went
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.520]   I think it's 1399, but it's worth 10 times that amount of money
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   and what it's
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.960]   It's got so much content. I don't even know where to begin. You can look at how the movies are made
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.040]   There's a timeline of disney movies
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.560]   There's model making so you can take one of the characters from racquet ralph and create your own little scenes
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.600]   It's got so much of and I want to use this people's words around
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.760]   But it's got so much of the magic of disney in it
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.960]   And it's right on your ipad wherever you want to take it
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.480]   It's one of the best multimedia sort of experiences
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.680]   I've seen and it's just it's such an amazingly well done app
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.960]   Especially for a company like disney to put all of this into the ipad
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.120]   I thought it was just fantastic and i've been going through it. I'm nowhere near finished
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.520]   for the last two days
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.640]   Very nice
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.280]   Yeah, I downloaded it right away as it is mind boggling we picked it as our epic of the week on
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.160]   ipad today really beautiful
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.680]   From touch press the same guys who did elements and and oh really
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.040]   Pyramids 3d they do fabulous fabulous work
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:24.000]   Then one of my favorite features in this one is the uh, they have this thing called the color map
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.640]   That basically shows you every disney film
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.960]   Just as the colors, but then you can sort of dive in and look at the individual scenes
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.680]   They have stills the entire movie in this sort of timeline view. It's unbelievable
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.240]   It's pretty amazing that they could do this
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.640]   Um, there's the color gap. Yeah. Yeah, I hope they do this for their star wars property
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.840]   Hope they do this for their marvel properties and I hope other companies like Warner started doing this because you know you have all those books
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.240]   Like visual encyclopedia's and you see them whenever you go to additional bookstore
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.800]   And just the ability to have it on an ipad is so much easier and you can do so much more with it. Yep
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.240]   when I think that
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.200]   We didn't what we didn't touch upon today was of course all the I think you guys dealt with a lot last week
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.520]   the um all the pat or not the the
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.520]   e-book stuff
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.040]   And I think that what apple is missing. I think everyone's missing at some degree
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   But I think apple uh hasn't
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.440]   Capitalized on enough rather than trying to compete in the e-book market is to really use this as a platform for the next generation of books
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.160]   And I think that what these guys are doing is is the next generation
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:28.400]   I mean that this is what everything looks like 10 or 15 years from now, you know, like this is what you're going to expect your your manuals
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.120]   Your, you know, obviously your textbooks everything else and people are getting you know, they're they're going there as slowly as they can because it's hard
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.680]   You know, it's hard to do it well, but um, it's a great example. I buy everything that they make
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.680]   It's just as just as reference
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.480]   I think srennerty called about mentioned it when she was on the show
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.920]   But you know push bop press went to facebook and they haven't seen much from them
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:54.640]   But apple has made itunes author and they haven't really updated it since but there's so much opportunity to make these kind of tools so that anybody
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.320]   Can start building the exact well?
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.000]   I think that's the frustrating thing is that apple built some tools that and then just doesn't
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.440]   You know, like, okay. Here's something you can kind of do that with but iBook author needs to wants to be a lot more than that
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:08.320]   You know and and they should that's the kind of app
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.960]   I think they should be developing over and over and over and it's too small
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.160]   I know they just don't have the money to put behind development
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.440]   They do amazing stuff like aperture and then let it sit for three years
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.880]   Right
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.840]   And it's a shame because these are great programs. I mean author is an amazing free
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.320]   Program exactly and and I would love to see them make a pro version and charge 300 bucks and
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.600]   Update all the time. I just think that I guess apparently there's a scarcity of talent
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:42.560]   I know and and the problem is is that I just but I guess my the way that they should acquire the talent the same way google or a lot of other people
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   Decired just buy a bunch by that company
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.320]   And then and then and then you know or buy these companies and build build that in but the
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.320]   You know talent acquisition is you know, is is an easy way or easier way to do that dr
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.720]   T s what age would be appropriate for disney animated? I I think uh, you know, there's something for everybody
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.040]   Um, but any any eight year old or up would be be able to use all of the features
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.920]   I haven't you know, I haven't handed it to my son yet, but just because I haven't had time
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.720]   Look at it. We just dig in here. We just dig in wouldn't be able to get all the value out of it
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   But he's getting he'd probably get more than I do. I mean he's
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.320]   There's an animator. You can actually learn animation which is pretty cool. Right. Yeah, one of the things that's cool
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.400]   So I mean apple can't do everything and we saw with push-pop press and mic madis that independence can do this
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.880]   The people who made wonders of the universe have a platform called goliath that they actually built the app in
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.200]   And they're starting to make that available to other people who want to start making those kind of experiences too
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.440]   And if I could make wonders with the universe without ever subject I want, um, that would be fantastic
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:46.880]   Your pick of the week mr. Alex lindsey. I became obsessed and I uh, um, this is not became became
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.400]   Not anything new. So go ahead. You know, anyway, so one of the issues that we have is we have a lot of need
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.600]   We use uh iPhones and I more often ipod touches as heads-up displays
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.000]   Um, so that we can think about that you use what I mean by that what I mean by that is
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.760]   We did it for max trollbot. We put an iphone inside the head because you couldn't see we yeah, we do it a lot because we want that
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.040]   No, no, I don't mean heads up like I mean, uh, we we think it was heads-up displays, um, but it's just a small monitor
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.360]   When you're in an event so we do a lot of hangouts and we want to be able to talk to you while you're in the event
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.200]   And so we we we want to attach iPhones or or ipads or or android phones or whatever
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.480]   Next to your monitors so that I can sit there and send you messages and stuff like that
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.200]   Right and so mounting those becomes the obsession
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:36.080]   And so we so I literally went and bought every quarter or 20 amount that you can that I could find on the internet
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:41.120]   Um and I and I and I've taken all of those there's probably like 20 20 of them
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.360]   And I've condensed them down to the three that i'm going to show you okay
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.680]   And i'll show you my pick but there are different reasons
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.680]   These would be for mounting iPhones in various
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:54.880]   You want to mount an iPhone or or an android phone or anything else because most of these are all all of these three
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:00.720]   One of the requirements became important to us was that they were adjustable so that you could put either an android or a or an iPhone
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.240]   And mount them so we have a close-up for Alex's show use my close-up
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:09.680]   I can hand them to you close-up can so you can you can bundle them on your own there?
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.920]   So um, there's so there's different we don't oh, okay, so i'll hand it to me first one
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.840]   This one's inexpensive. I shall be your hand monitor
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:22.160]   You're gonna see this in a bunch of prices the same japan or same chinese company makes all of them
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.560]   The head bendy legs
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.760]   They come with bendy legs. They come with jobi leg
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.800]   Yes, you see that's a little just fits anything
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.960]   It's got a cute little handle on the top
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:37.280]   You know most you're trying to do it like that. Yeah, exactly and so so there you go
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.760]   And the important piece of that feature is if you unscrew that little um the little tripod there
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.520]   Yeah, um, you know you got a little you know you can hook that into anything anything
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.120]   Because it's a tripod mount um you can also get what sorry I said again
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.200]   Sold yeah, oh, but wait, but more there's more okay, so
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.720]   So the main thing is is that remember that you can also get I forgot to bring one down
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.760]   But you can also get a mount that would allow you to um
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:04.400]   Uh put it on a cold shoe mount or hot shoe mount, you know you can so you can slide it on top of your camera
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:09.280]   On top of your camera so if you flash would go and why that's important when I've used that for it like CES and so on
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.400]   So forth this i'll take my camera and i'll put my note so I walk around CES and I take all my notes of what I want to say about
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:18.720]   This product and then I can put it on my iPhone and clip it to the top of my camera
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.800]   So that i'm looking at it while i'm talking and i'm showing stuff and so so anyways, it's kind of
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.760]   These are big enough to go as big as maybe a galaxy notes right right they won't fit everything
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:32.000]   But they and they certainly want a tablet. I wonder if somebody makes a tablet version. Yeah, they do because that's a yeah
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.200]   There's there's I didn't bring the tablet ones. I have a lot of those. That's very useful
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:40.720]   I actually have have one of these and it really yeah because it holds any phone with a little tripod with a little tripod
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.280]   That's kind of like the jobe used to be the little ones that used to be there
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:47.920]   Or this little one. This is like eight dollars and ninety nine cents. So it's it's cheap
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.800]   Um, and so and we have now started adding them to a lot of our our kits that tripod
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.360]   I said there's a lot of different tripods. You can buy little tripods
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.080]   You can do it
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.520]   But we put them in a lot of our kits now because they're so cheap it's eight eight eight dollars and any sign
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.720]   Okay, so that's one one that's a little bit more now who makes this could or is it just like it's a knockoff
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.400]   It's a anybody there's you'll see just look where it looks star. I think is the one that we got
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.160]   Um, they come in you know, but the only thing that makes differences is what bag they come in
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.480]   They're all you know, I ordered I thought that they were different and I ordered them and I have like six of them
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:22.240]   They're all the same. So they're just different pictures. Um, so this one's made by thought out and this is part of the PED series
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.560]   They do some stuff in the number of their
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:30.960]   Yeah, the the construction is very specific now for the device. Well, it's not not exactly here
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.080]   You can arrange it or you can pull my iPhone in there. Here's yeah
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:38.000]   If you look on the other side of that this one's a little bit more rigid what I like about it is that yeah
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.560]   So you can unscrew those with a little allen wrench that comes with it and then and adjust it
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.800]   So you do make this for this for whatever phone you're gonna use
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.600]   But then once you tighten it down, it's gonna be for that phone exactly and I like the arm, you know separates it out
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.680]   It's about $35. It's a little bit more expensive. Um, you know, it's gonna last longer
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.880]   It's also got the quarter 20 all of them have quarter 20, right?
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.520]   And so so it's it's kind of a cool little
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   Way to you know, you can put it on top of your tripod and get it up there as a as a display mount
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   What are they gonna make good cars with this?
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.000]   Threaded that would be so awesome
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.400]   Tripod car, but the main thing is even for cars. I mean a lot of times you can get
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.040]   Uh, there's all kinds of things that i'll attach to your car or attach to anything that'll that'll go to us
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.800]   Yeah, that'll go to a quarter 20. So once you get the quarter 20 you're kind of you're you're
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.880]   You're in the section cup with a male quarter 20 quarter 20 by the way is the name of the standard
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.560]   Uh threading for uh tripods, right?
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:34.960]   Right. So what does it what does it stand for? Um quarter inch quarter it's 20
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.960]   It's not a revolution 20 twist per inch and by the way someone on on the
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.960]   On the irc said that the case star is 27
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.720]   Dollars, but there are versions with a tripod that are eight dollars and 99 cents
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.480]   So, you know, you just but they're all knockoffs and they're all the same. That's what i said
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.840]   Okay, they'll get the expensive one
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:57.040]   Yeah, and then and then the um this one is the coolest one that i carry around now all the time like you just you know
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.040]   You just gotta make sure check that out. So this is made by joe bean. We like joe bean has lots of
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.120]   Unfold it. Unfold it. Oh, what?
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.880]   It's doing something. Oh look so i could put a phone in a similar same idea a little squeezy
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:17.200]   But it's tiny so you can put it into into your bag and everything else and it's just it's just like it's almost non-existent
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.760]   I don't know how much that is. It's like 20 or 30 dollars
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.960]   So it's maybe in 19 dollars or something like that, but it's but it is um, but it's well
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.840]   Well, well built well designed fits in your pocket
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.720]   You know, I keep one of my scottie vests, you know, like in my little yeah
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.640]   I'm just like oh, I gotta attach this to something and um it's called their grip type
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.960]   1995 so type now yeah grip time and it's just a great little and so it's the
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.080]   In my like if there's the one that i'm carrying around is the joe
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.600]   It's all paying that my pick but but all of these are useful in different ways
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.200]   Um as I said if you're looking for you know the cost conscious these little
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:55.680]   Case star ones are great, but the the joe bean is just it's just this it's just so well like I just love things that
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.760]   Someone really
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.960]   That took a lot of work just started one on amazon prime. Yeah, so
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.840]   So anyway, and it's just a great thing to have around
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.720]   Especially if you're doing any kind of production or anything where you might want to do it
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.520]   Because now you can go once you have one of these you can go to any
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:13.920]   Phone store any best buy grab a tripod throw this on and boom your
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:17.600]   And you've got including a gorilla pod if you have a joe bean gorilla pod that'll work fine with it
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.920]   It doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be it can be anything
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.240]   And so and now you can you know you can shoot images
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.480]   So this could you know, I use it for heads up
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.040]   But you can obviously use it for travel photography and all these other fun stuff. So so anyway, um
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.320]   That's that's my pick. I need a little small packable monopod
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.080]   For my next trip. I have small packable ones
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:45.440]   I have a big month man. Throw it on that throw that weighs 20 pounds, but man is that good and you can defend yourself and your camera
