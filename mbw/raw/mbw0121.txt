[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.280]   I was in France.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   I'm back now.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.080]   And I understand you did shows without me.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.720]   How did you do it?
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.080]   Alex Lindsey was in Japan this whole time doing that.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   That's impressive.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   Thank you.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.080]   >> It was fun.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800]   We had a good time, but we're going to have it back.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.240]   >> Well, I'm glad I missed you.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   And I hope you didn't do too well, because then you don't need me anymore.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.760]   >> No, no, I think we decided that I'm kind of -- I am the Phil Schiller.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.680]   >> Did you talk about that, by the way?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040]   About Phil Schiller talking?
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   >> Yeah, that whole thing.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   >> Yes.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040]   >> We did talk about that.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.040]   >> Because they screwed us again, didn't they?
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.200]   Because the minute Mac Break Weekly 119 wrapped, they announced that.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   Like, the minute.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.760]   It was like literally the minute.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760]   And I saw that.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.520]   And I was on a plane to France.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   And I saw that.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   >> Oh, man.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.840]   Oh, man.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.440]   But you managed to talk about it last week, I'm sure.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.760]   Alex Lindsey is here for Pixel Core.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760]   Back from Japan.

[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   >> Hello, hello.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   Good to be back, I'm sure.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   >> It is.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.280]   Japan was fantastic, by the way.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   >> Oh, I can't wait for that.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.480]   >> Got to meet with some of our listeners, and that was fantastic.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   But I'm really glad to be back with the family.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   And back at work.

[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.400]   My French is better than I thought it was.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   At least I think it was.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   >> Mine really gets good about the last day.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.960]   >> Little hint, though.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   Reed Devaux is not veal chop.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   It's not veal cutlet.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.920]   It's a thymus gland.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   So don't eat it.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   It's not.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.200]   >> You know, I just got a note from my doctor.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   I'm not allowed to eat thymus gland.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.200]   >> No thymus glands for you.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.920]   Sweetbreads are right out.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.400]   >> We are glad to have you back, Leo, Alex Diddy, commendable job.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   >> Well, Alex is the best.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.600]   >> But in fact, it is the job of Phil Schiller to fill the shoes of Steve Jobs.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720]   And nobody envies that position.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.800]   But I can tell you we did check.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.320]   We had cameras on Alex while he was not aware of it.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.240]   He never used note cards.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.960]   Very impressed.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.840]   Did he slug a bottle of water at any point?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.040]   >> We were totally false.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.320]   >> Hey, there's Andy Anacow from the Chicago Sun Times in a celestial waste of bandwidth
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.760]   and an Arduino expert.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.280]   >> Oh, dear, no, no, no, no, no, God knows.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.960]   Remember, see, we've been exchanging a little, I wanted to help you get through like your
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.000]   any worries that you have about your talk next.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   >> So nervous about that presentation.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.120]   >> There's a reason why I call my website the Celestial Waste of Vanwitt.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.840]   If your audience comes into the room with low expectations, you cannot possibly fail.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   So if you just say basically, well, Andy just bought his first arduino about it, you know,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.040]   it's going to be delivered the day before he leaves San Francisco.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.960]   He's going to fool around with a little bit on the plane right over and he might be able
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   to get a light bulb to light up if you push up, if you push a button.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.000]   Then when something more interesting than that happens, well, they feel like that's a
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   bonus.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   >> Well, we know.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   >> I guess I'm going to call my feature presentation Nap Time with Leo.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.720]   A chance for us all to rest and relax and recuperate after an arduous Mac world expo.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   >> You're going to be like the cave on the cave on the cave on the cave?

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   The cave?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   Sleeping cave?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.240]   >> Oh, you're like the cave on Dagobah.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.400]   >> Yes.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   >> What's in there?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.240]   >> Only what you bring in.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.200]   >> I like you.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.720]   I like you very much.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   >> No, it's so we're going to do Mac break weekly in noon.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   I've been handed this slip of paper to tell us where.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.360]   I will open the envelope now.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.680]   We've been keeping it a secret.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.840]   And now I can tell the world will be at the Mac world Learning Center booth 3236 at the
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.960]   far back left of the North Hall.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.400]   >> Can you just say that one more time?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   >> Are you writing this down, Scott?
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120]   >> I'm trying to write this down so I know where to go.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   >> A lot of people are going to be there.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.440]   I bought eight microphones for this and I don't even know if that's enough.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.040]   But certainly you guys will be and I'm going to invite everybody who's ever been on Mac
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   break weekly.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.320]   I'm already hearing from a lot of people who've never been on Mac break weekly who want
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.720]   to make their debut.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.960]   We will be at Mac world Expo at 12 noon sharp.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.560]   And by the way, don't be late because we only get an hour.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.360]   We've never done an hour long Mac break weekly.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.160]   >> We spent an hour getting ready to do that.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   >> That's right.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   We don't even have that.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.200]   >> This is so hope we got an hour total Mac world Learning Center booth 3236.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   >> I want to say Fairbanks, Alaska 039 for no far bank left of North far back left of
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.440]   North Hall.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.280]   We're going to be in a you want more information?
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   I'll tell you.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.440]   We're going to be in a 40 foot by 40 foot booth.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   >> Oh, no.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   >> So don't all of you come.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   >> They know how many people come to see us.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   >> All of you come, please.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.200]   Didn't you have Paul Ken on the show last week?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   >> Three weeks ago.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.400]   >> Yeah, apparently Paul never came to see any of the live Mac breaks we've recorded
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   at Mac world.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   >> That's all right.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   >> Remember when we did it?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   What was that two years ago at the 21st Amendment upstairs?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.640]   >> Yeah, that really didn't work to it.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.440]   >> Man, it was code.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   >> What was amazing to me was that I was watching people stand on the stairway and having
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.600]   one of those moments like this could be a disaster movie go through my head while
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120]   doing the show.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.920]   >> If Justin Azerik hadn't been sitting in my lap at the time, I probably would have
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.400]   had similar thoughts, but my mind was occupied.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.760]   >> So please go ahead.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.960]   >> I'm sure Justin will be there as will all of our Mac friends and I hope you will
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.480]   to all jammed into a 40 by 40 booth.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.040]   >> Okay.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.000]   >> What's the point without the sex?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.680]   >> Without the nudity, without the babies, and without the mud, I hope.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.040]   >> There's very much plenty of that though.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.400]   >> And then Scott, you're going to be doing presentations galore, I'm sure, throughout
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   the show.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.600]   What are you going to be on?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   >> You know, go to scottborn.com for the full list, but I'm doing a Wednesday night
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.000]   birds of a feather at 5.30.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.160]   We're going to talk about the convergence of photography, still cameras and video.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:29.200]   I'm doing a thing on Thursday with the conferences, teaching apertures part of the users conference
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.000]   Wednesday in the afternoon over at the photo center.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.600]   I'm going to be doing a thing on storage and backup of your photography with my friend's
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Drobo.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.480]   I'm going to be appearing Drobo booth, the lens baby booth.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   I don't know.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   But I know this.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   >> You.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.240]   >> I'm going to start early on my trek to booth 3236 far back left of North Hall so that
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   I don't be late there.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.040]   >> Well, I've done some calculations and if each of you takes up a two square foot area,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.320]   we'll have enough room for 20 people.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.120]   So it's going to be a good show.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.640]   Alex, what are you doing Alex?
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   You're doing on Wednesday.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   I'm doing a seminar on taking film techniques and applying them to iMovie.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.560]   And then on Friday, it's all day.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.320]   I'm talking about podcasting.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   So cool.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.040]   I'm just all the different aspects of podcasting.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.600]   So it's podcasting.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.200]   >> And Andy, you're doing that whole thing.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.960]   It's kind of like a mini TED conference is a really cool idea.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.440]   >> I'm doing two or three things.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:38.560]   On Tuesday right after our podcast, I'm rushing, rushing, rushing to room 134 Hall E. And
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.560]   I'm doing a panel.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.580]   I'm doing a session that's titled How to Share Damned Near Anything on your Mac with
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.580]   Damned Near Anybody.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.260]   So we're going to see in 45 minutes how many of the different services and things on the
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.580]   OS that can be shared by the network I can get through.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.500]   >> And how long it takes before the recording industry Association of America shows up with
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   a CEPE.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.620]   >> See, that's just good marketing.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.220]   I'm hoping to be the don't taste me, bro.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:09.100]   >> Here, take this and don't taste me with it.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.660]   >> Don't taste me, bro.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.700]   >> Not until Leo comes with the camera, hang on, towards the window.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.660]   >> Hold on, I can't sit by aperture yet.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.740]   I have to get the tripod just so.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.740]   >> Yes.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.380]   >> Oh, that was good.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.180]   That may be my most favorite moment of the show so far.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.740]   >> Don't taste me, don't taste me, bro.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.340]   >> That's the last show, by the way, of 2008.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.340]   >> And that's got to be the title of the show, Leo.
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.180]   >> Okay, I'm writing down right now on this special white card.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.180]   >> Hang on.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.180]   >> What the?
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.180]   >> What the?
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.380]   What the hell?
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.140]   You got Eve in there with you?
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.100]   >> I was doing some work.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.020]   This is part of what I'm doing for that Ted style.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.820]   >> Are you watching Wally over and over and over?
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.580]   Are you watching Wally on a loop?
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   >> No, no.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.340]   >> Eve settled down.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.380]   Yeah, so that's what we're talking about.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   Do we do it earlier on?
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.340]   I'm basically doing 20 minutes on how to use the Mac to build gadgets and gizmos and electronics.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.620]   >> See, Eve gets, so basically I'm interfacing the Mac to an Eve toy so I can control it
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.180]   via Apple script and have it do cool things.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.780]   So last night, last night, I went to Toys R Us and bought this really cool animatronic
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.780]   wall-eat toy.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:23.620]   Unfortunately, I've learned that she responds to voice and if you talk loudly and authoritatively,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.620]   she gets angry.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:33.220]   >> But if you talk sweetly and manipulously, she becomes very nice and sweet.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.740]   How could she tell the difference between sweet and rough?
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.340]   >> Well, because she can see into the human solely.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.540]   >> She's like the Ike Turner of robots.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.540]   >> Well, she is well-armed.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.540]   [laughter]
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:49.540]   >> It's good to speak nicely and sweetly so she doesn't wish us all into the cornfield.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.540]   [laughter]
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.500]   Isn't that right?
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.020]   >> So do you have like Scott does on your celestial ways to bandwidth, like a list of
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.340]   all the things you can sound like you're doing a lot of things?
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.980]   >> Yes, I'm putting that up later today now that I actually have my schedule a little
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.980]   bit tighter said.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.980]   >> I think that's the first time I met you in your hat was a Macworld Expo.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.780]   >> Oh, I think the first time I met my three of my sisters was at Macworld.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.780]   [laughter]
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.860]   >> Which is why, by the way, and I got an email from Paul Kent saying the rumors of our death
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.180]   are greatly exaggerated.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.940]   People are very concerned about this story.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:30.420]   You talked about it last week that first of all, why did they wait so long to say that
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.740]   Steve Jobs is not going to be giving the keynote?
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.380]   And that has given rise to rumors and I'm seeing them now that today, especially that
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.180]   there's something wrong with Steve, that Steve is ill or not looking good.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.660]   >> Yeah, but this is sourced by some dude.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.620]   And so that's, I'm serious.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.220]   I mean, if, you know, I mean-
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.980]   >> But it does, but I mean, I have to say there's some credibility, Andy, because why
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.260]   would they, look, you make that decision six months ahead of time.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.500]   You don't make that decision two weeks ahead of time.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.700]   >> Well, there are so many different reasons why they would want to hold off until the
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.220]   close to the date.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.820]   Among them being that they have sort of an implied responsibility to the show, given
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.140]   that Steve has been the headliner every year for more or less forever.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.940]   >> But that's kind of misleading, don't you think that people sign up to see Mr. Jobs
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.580]   and then find out after it's too late?
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.180]   >> There's no guarantee.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.140]   They never announced anything.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:31.260]   To me, the big point has always been if the CEO of any company is so sick that he cannot
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.860]   make a certain appearance and he is so damn sick.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.660]   They don't want to risk saying, well, look, he's just going to be sick for a couple of
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.020]   weeks and we want to cancel right now.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.180]   If he's so sick, if he's on his deathbed, that is, that's the reason why you don't pull
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.420]   that kind of junk is because the same reason why you don't walk into a bank with a gun
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.340]   and say stick him up and hand him over the money.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.380]   The consequences are legal, very big and very, very serious.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.580]   >> So that your position is, they just couldn't, it couldn't be the case or they would have.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.580]   >> See, Steve's been saying all along, hey, it's my business, which by the way, I agree
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.300]   with him and I almost feel guilty talking about this.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.020]   If he's health isn't good, it's his problem, not the world's problem.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.940]   He's not the president of the United States.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.980]   He's just running a little business here.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:24.420]   >> My position is just that number one, I have absolutely no real journalistic evidence
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.500]   to point to the idea that Steve's health is taking a turn for the worse.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.900]   I can see plenty of good reasons why alternative explanations for why you would play these
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.820]   cards exactly this way if you were Apple.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:44.100]   And again, unless you bring me evidence that's better than some dude told me this, then I
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.300]   just have to chalk that up as just a rumor.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.460]   >> I think Andy's point regarding the deathbed stuff is very accurate.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.460]   I can promise you there will be shareholder lawsuits, a plantee.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.460]   >> What if he just looks bad?
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:01.140]   >> Well, then screw everybody that's got a problem with that.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:07.860]   If I've had my lawyers research this, there's not a lot of settled case law on what his
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.700]   duties to disclose his health condition are.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   There are new laws that are being tested that might have some impact, but whether or not
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.700]   there are laws, there's going to be shareholder lawsuits because anybody can file a lawsuit
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.300]   when lose or draw.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.820]   And if it were to be something like Andy, I think Andy's keywords there were like he's
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.420]   two weeks away from death kind of stuff, then that would be the problem.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.700]   Now if six months after Macworld we hear he's sick, then people don't have anything to
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   come.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.780]   And I do agree there's plenty of reasons not for him to be there.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.780]   And I do think it's been mishandled.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.780]   >> What's the upside?
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.140]   If he is that sick, again, if these rumors that we're seeing posted today are true, if
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.980]   he's that sick that he's going to be dead in six weeks, the stock is going to take an
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.900]   immense nosedive.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.540]   When out of the blue suddenly we've been told that the CEO of Apple has dropped dead.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.180]   What is the upside to delaying that?
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.180]   >> I don't think he's on death's door.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.020]   >> Well, I'm saying, well, I'm addressing the rumors that are coming out today that are
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.900]   just at- >> That's what they're saying that he's
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.900]   like dying.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.500]   >> Yeah, Kevin Rose is doing his thing saying that Steve's got serious health problems and
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.260]   I'm sure that's getting lots of traffic on a dig.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:26.540]   >> The power of the dude, the big little guy was completely right.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.180]   >> I just don't see any evidence to support it.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.180]   I'm with Andy.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.220]   I think there are lots of good business cases for this to happen the way it's happened.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.020]   I think as is typical of what I think of the way Apple's PR is handled, it hasn't been
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   great.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.060]   >> Well, I have to say when I first read the press release, I misread it and I thought,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.220]   "Oh, Apple's not going to be at Macworld 2010 and Steve's not going to speak at 2010."
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.020]   I was kind of surprised when I came back.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.740]   That's how I left it the whole time I was on vacation.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.540]   I came back and reread it.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.500]   >> Did you open your speaker letter from Macworld?
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.940]   >> No, what did it say?
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.420]   >> It further added to the confusion because it says you need to line up at the speaker's
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.780]   office at 7.30 in the morning.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.820]   >> Or the Steve Jobs keynote.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.700]   >> Oh, it did say Steve Jobs.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.780]   >> It's right in there.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.780]   >> That's it.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.780]   >> Type 'em.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.100]   >> So, besides the obvious disappointment because Steve Jobs' keynote is a rock show.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.660]   It's like Bono saying, "You two is going to play without me."
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.820]   It's a big deal.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.060]   But aside from the disappointment, is it also a blow to Macworld?
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.660]   >> Yes, definitely.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   I mean--
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.660]   >> It was just prestige.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:40.820]   It didn't-- now, Paul can't really make great pains to say, "Look, we've learned our
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.060]   lesson from Macworld Boston.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.420]   Apple pulling out does not kill the show.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.700]   There are many reasons to still do Macworld in 2010.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.700]   We've already booked it.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   We're doing it."
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.540]   >> But he said all that before the one in Boston peered out too.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.260]   >> It's not good for Macworld.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.260]   Not to have Apple there.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.900]   >> He's not saying anything different than they didn't say that time.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.980]   >> Well, I think that the thing that has more of an impact is Apple not having a booth
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.500]   or Adobe not having a booth.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.500]   >> There you go.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.500]   >> That continues on.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.060]   I think that's more of a deal than Steve not doing a keynote.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.060]   >> Well, yeah, why do you go to Macworld now?
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   >> So, okay.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.740]   >> Well, the thing is, I don't go for those things.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.060]   I go for the Mac.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   I go for Steve.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.060]   I go for Steve.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.700]   >> Steve, I go to look at all the little booths.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:33.260]   See, to me, the value of Macworld for someone going there is the 10 to 20 foot booths that
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.900]   have smaller companies of the stuff that I'm not going to see in a magazine.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.100]   They don't have an overwhelming PR in Mac--
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.100]   >> That's because you're a journalist.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.340]   Do you think the average person wants to know that?
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.340]   >> No.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   >> Okay.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.900]   >> I just feel like that's where I see all the cool stuff that I end up using on a day
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.620]   to day basis, the other stuff I can find out anytime I want.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.220]   >> I mean, there's a lot of stuff beyond Apple and beyond Steve Jobs.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.580]   Among them is it's a hell of an educational conference that you just don't have the same
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:06.020]   sort of opportunities to get two days of absolutely intense education from a worldwide
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   leading expert.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.020]   >> But that's expensive.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   >> Cut.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.620]   Well, because there's so many people that are in that sort of position where they're
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.900]   being given X dollars by their company to suddenly learn how to edit video and final
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:25.580]   cut or how to develop software using this system.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.980]   If it's known that every year, every top leading expert comes to San Francisco for one
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.620]   week at a very, very nice city with lots of really, really good restaurants, do you want
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:41.700]   to spend your $2,000 of your company's money at a Ramana in Iowa City or do you want to
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.340]   spend it getting two days worth of really great instruction in San Francisco?
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.620]   >> So it becomes an educational conference.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:55.140]   I wonder what percentage of people pay for conference passes, which are up to, what is
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.060]   several thousand bucks, right?
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.620]   >> It's expensive.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.900]   >> Compared to the number of people who paid to 25 or whatever it is, I don't even know,
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.220]   15 bucks to get in just to see the show floor.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.260]   Alex says he goes for the show floor.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.660]   >> Yeah, well, I speak, I mean, I speak at the conference and I-
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.380]   >> Yeah, that's why I don't know how much it costs.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.060]   I haven't paid, I don't think I've ever paid.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.100]   >> Yeah, so I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, in and out of the conference and there's
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.020]   oftentimes very, very good ones.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.620]   Usually my problem is is that I have so many meetings and then we, because we cover the
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.900]   show the last couple of years, we spend most of the time on the floor shooting stuff.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.220]   So I haven't, I don't see it as often, although I have to say my first digital video seminar
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.500]   that I ever took to kind of get into, into that was at Macworld.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.020]   You know, that was in early 90s.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:45.860]   And so, so it is, it definitely has, you know, the base that they use for the speakers is,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.860]   is amazing.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.020]   It's just really the who's who.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.180]   And so it is a great- >> It's kind of amazing because they don't
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.740]   pay speakers, do they?
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.060]   >> Well, we get, we get paid, we don't get expenses and we don't get paid.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   >> You're getting paid?
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.060]   >> Well, I'm not getting paid.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:25.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:43.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:50.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.060]   >> I'm getting paid for the first time.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   >> Headphones, the JBL headphones.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   >> The headphones, those are good.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   >> The Jealouskin.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.060]   >> It's such a big bag that even Alex couldn't lose it.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.060]   >> It's such a big bag that I'm taking you back.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.060]   >> Nice.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.060]   >> I love you to the fear.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   >> It won't fit in overhead.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.060]   I'll tell you that.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.060]   >> It was crazy.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.060]   >> All right.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   Let's not all make people jealous now.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   >> We earned that.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   We have to go stand to do hard labor.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.060]   >> One of these days I actually write this speech.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.060]   >> I think I'm one of the other.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.060]   >> Paul Kent's listening going, why did I ask LaPorte?
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.060]   >> Who's line isn't anywhere as a Mac show?
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.060]   It's like, okay, we're doing improv.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   I need a situation, a problem, and a hypothetical apple product.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   Go.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.060]   >> That's pretty much what I do normally.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.060]   >> I was thinking maybe I could tell Steve, hey Steve, last chance,
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.060]   if you want to give the speech, I got a slot on Thursday, 9 a.m.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.060]   You could surprise everybody.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.060]   I could just do a little talk and say, oh, and one more thing,
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   and he could walk out.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.060]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   >> That would be awesome.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   >> Steve, I got $100 right here.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.060]   >> The thing we haven't mentioned, we touched on it last week,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.060]   but I really want to hit it again is, you know, if Paul is as smart
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.060]   as I think he is, and he's a smart man, he gets lots of awards
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060]   for running trade shows.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.060]   >> Oh, he's smart.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   >> If he's smart, what he'll do next year is dramatically increase
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   the opportunities for networking, because for me, that's where
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.060]   I make, you know, that's what's happening at conferences now is
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.060]   that's why the unconferences and all these things, they do so well.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.060]   It really isn't about going to see somebody talk, especially if you
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   can't get Steve Jobs anymore.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   It's really about who you meet, who you talk to, what you're learning.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.060]   >> And it's a gathering of the tribes, it's a gathering of the culture.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   >> Right.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.060]   >> You make deals in the back rooms, you make deals in the hallways.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.060]   I met Linda Wyman at Macville, and now I got four titles on Linda.com.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.060]   >> I mean, I just want to say I got a hundred bucks, look at this, five
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.060]   $20 bills, nice and crisp, just exchange my euros for these babies.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.060]   Steve, it's all yours.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:16.060]   If you want to come and take my presentation $100 right here, cash on the table.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.060]   >> I'll throw a hundred in two.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.060]   >> There you go, $200.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.060]   >> That's keeping going.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.060]   >> Thanks to the Scott Borne matching fund.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:29.060]   >> Oh, I'd like to participate in this too, and Scott, Leo, I'll underbid
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.060]   Steve Jobs, and I'll do it for 120.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.060]   >> Okay, you got a deal.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.060]   Put it back in my wallet.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   >> I will say this, I would definitely be excited about a keynote by Andy
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   Enocho.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   >> Andy's great, I've seen Andy speak many times, I think Andy's wonderful.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.060]   >> Don't be so sure, because I see I am one of the few people in the world who
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   have been in Phil's shoes, to have to like keynote the first day at Mac
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   Rolled Expo, when everybody would absolutely love to see Steve Jobs there and
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.060]   up there instead of you.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060]   >> That's tough.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:23.060]   >> I deliver the keynote of death at the very last Boston Mac Rolled
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.060]   It's like you don't have another act followed the who, you just have to burn the stage to the ground because you don't want anyone else
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.060]   sullying that stage where the who did the greatest concert ever.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.060]   >> The keynote of death featuring Andy Enocho.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   >> Is that on YouTube?
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.060]   >> Can we search keynote of death and find that?
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   >> Well, see, it is a keynote of death because just a week later at Mac Hack, the Mac Hack Conference had like their
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   keynote or cancel out like on like five days notice and they asked me, look, can you just give the same keynote again at our conference?
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   And I keynoteed there before like seven or eight years ago, so I said sure, sure, it went over there.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   Delivered the keynote of death and it was there last Mac, last show.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   >> Now I know I Paul can't ask me to do the feature, not you.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.060]   >> He knew something.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   >> What was that?
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   >> I'll come over there, I will deliver the keynote of death into the hole where they're coming up.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.060]   The entire colony will be wiped out.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   It is the keynote of death.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.060]   >> So what's Phil Schiller going to do?
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.060]   Predictions for his speech?
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   >> Nothing big, nothing shiny.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.060]   I think they're, I think he's chiefly going to do updates to things we've already seen.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   We're going to see a rundown of Snow Leopard, we're going to see speed bumps to existing products.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   I am totally convinced that the reason why Apple is making this shift is so that they can simply host every single major
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   product rollout on the Apple campus in a totally controlled environment.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:54.060]   >> At this point, at this point, in fact, if they had had something important to announce, they now can't.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.060]   Because it would, because it would obviate everything.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.060]   The whole point of this that we don't have to do these big presentations anymore.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.060]   >> Right.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   I mean, it's not only just these big presentations under someone else's roof.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:10.060]   It's also we have to have something to show off the second week in January, whether we want to or not.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.060]   >> That's tough, right?
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.060]   >> I understand, actually.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   >> Apple no longer needs anybody else to get a crowd together.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   >> They've eliminated a pointless and meaningless deadline for themselves.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060]   That's what they've done.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:30.060]   >> Scott, it feels going to give us the, hey, have we talked to you about Snow Leopard?
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.060]   >> That's my prediction.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.060]   That's the big deal at this year's MacBook.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.060]   >> No netbook?
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   >> No.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   >> Not a Mac world.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.060]   That's the sort of thing they'll do with Cupertino.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   >> But they will do that, you think?
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.060]   >> Look at how netbooks has sold for the first time.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.060]   >> And netbooks has sold for Christmas.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.060]   Clearly, people want to cheap out on their notebooks.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.060]   I'm convinced the success of the notebook has nothing to do with form factor capability
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.060]   anything except that it's sub-500 bucks.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   >> Well, I wrote a piece on this a couple weeks ago that if you're looking for Apple, Apple
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   would do a netbook the same way that Apple would do a smartphone.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:11.060]   Meaning if you're predicting that if you're looking around at the smartphones that were on the
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.660]   market before the iPhone came out and try to predict how Apple would do a phone, you'd have
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.260]   gotten completely wrong because maybe they do want to make a device like that but they
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.020]   do it in entirely their own way.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.700]   If Apple were to make a $400 notebook, it would not be like a netbook.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:29.220]   It would have the same relationship to existing netbooks as the iPhone had to existing phones.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.740]   I can see Apple producing a $400 device like that because they make a great device that
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.660]   costs 200 bucks, call the iPhone, if they wanted to expand that a little bit and figure
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.180]   out a way to have a keyboard interface or expand the touch interface, I could see that
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.140]   happening but once again, it would be another device that simply expands the assets they
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.340]   already have, expanding the developer kit for the iPhone, they'd have to come up with
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.980]   a new name for this class of hardware like just the Apple touch devices as opposed to
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.420]   the iPhone and the iPod devices.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.580]   But I could definitely see it happening but it would definitely not be something that
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.780]   we could really sketch out in advance until we actually see it.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:18.100]   One thing we know he will not announce is the iFART and you think I'm joking but it's
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:25.060]   the number one selling item on the iTunes application store right now.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.700]   The power to be your best.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.620]   Isn't this the one, didn't Apple forbid this initially?
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.740]   I remember that they refuse something called some sort of fart machine.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.960]   I'm so embarrassed to even be talking about this.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.300]   Some sort of flatulence engine.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   That's a feature in Snow lepers.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.640]   Okay, those are two words that have never, I'm going to bet money, those two words have
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.140]   never been said on a podcast in all of humanity.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.140]   I'm missing Pascal notebook.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.420]   They have the difference engine and the flatulence engine.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.180]   Unfortunately, engineering at the time was incapable of producing.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.840]   The program launched December 12th through Christmas day.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.320]   The company sold 100,000 copies for 99 cents.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.040]   That's $100,000 in 14 days.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   Apple made 30,000.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.560]   It's the most money many made on flatulence ever.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.240]   No, I see I've actually been spending the past couple of weeks trying to think of G.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.960]   I kind of like to experiment with putting things on the iPhone store.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.700]   It shouldn't be interesting to take some of like fiction pieces and short stories that
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.820]   I really have no market for, package them as a book and sell them on the iPhone store.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:47.100]   Now I can't really do that because if I fail to outsell the fart machine application.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.100]   It's so humiliating.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.140]   I just have to kill myself is what I'm telling you.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.140]   I haven't.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.300]   Has anybody downloaded it and wants to demonstrate it?
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.540]   No, no.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.540]   I have it.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.940]   You know what?
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.540]   I just found out why Andy actually closed the Mac hack conference.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.120]   He built a frickin dart gun.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.600]   Yes.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   There's a picture of it.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.240]   Just why my flight got delayed and there's a picture of this dark gun connected to a
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.540]   giant battery and it's there.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.840]   It's the keynote of death.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.640]   Now I just did a search for I fart on the app store.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.120]   Holy cow.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.320]   There's I fart mobile.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   There's I fart.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   There's I fart with timer.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   There's I farts with a Z.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   There's I fart alert.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   There's I fart machine.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.880]   I fart my I fart.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.680]   I steam.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.560]   And I whoopee cushion.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.260]   So they're all 99 cents.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.360]   You really have to decide which one you want.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.080]   About none of them.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.720]   Yeah, I'm not that.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.280]   That's the free market at work.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.240]   It gave us the current economic crisis and the ability to decide with our consumer dollars
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   which fart machine meets and addresses our full synthetic fart needs.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.920]   It's got an embarrassed apple though.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.520]   When you go to the iTunes application store, you see top paid apps.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.920]   Number one, I fart mobile.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.680]   This is exactly what we had in mind.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   People embarrassing.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.880]   That's all I have to say.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.600]   No kiss going.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   Okay, you can have that one.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.560]   We're making how much?
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.640]   Oh, all right.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   I guess.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.280]   Right.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.600]   I rather have one of Andy's dark guns.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:27.760]   It just proves that you know when people were wondering about the why ringtones, you
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.280]   know, why people buy ringtones.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.240]   It's a $10 billion business.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.040]   This explains it.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   Because they're stupid.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.360]   It's 13 year old boys.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   But it is fun.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.640]   I have to admit, I have gotten into customizing my ringtones.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   I would never pay for ringtone.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.280]   But have you got one that sounds like a fart out?
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   Oh, God.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.320]   No, I'm going to have to put the my whole thing with ringtones.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   I try to think of a song that that that really personifies whoever's calling me like so for
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.120]   like Dr. Kiki when she calls, I have blinded me with science.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   Oh, that's good.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   You know, and it's good.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.000]   So you have a different song for every.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Can I ask you?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'm working.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I'm working.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I'm working.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   What do you play when I call?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.200]   No, you lose or baby.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.280]   Why don't you shoot me?
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.640]   No, I haven't I haven't thought about it for everyone yet because you don't want to put
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.040]   one in there as just a placeholder.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.480]   So right now, if it's if it's just a placeholder and I haven't figured it out yet, it's just
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.720]   the standard ring, which is men at work.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   Who can it be now?
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   Men at work.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   That's good.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   That's good.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   I come from the land down under.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:39.120]   We've been roaring and thunder for maybe that's yours or they make this sound.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.920]   Oh, I have the sound turned off.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.800]   Do you have something to say about this Eve?
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   Let's see.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   Feeling lucky.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   Oh, dear.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   Yes, exactly.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Exactly.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Oh, dear.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   Okay.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   I can see why this is the best selling application on the you got a sneak attack.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.560]   You got security.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.880]   Set your phone on a flat surface.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   The next time the phone is moved, it will fart.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   That's interesting.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   Okay.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.880]   That's a great.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   Oh, it works.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.400]   See, this is why this is the winner in the 99 cent fart category.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.440]   Oh, the show parting with style security fart.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.600]   This show is giving new meaning to the word rat hole.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.320]   We can no longer just say rat hole.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.920]   We got to have like, oh, look, it's got hundreds of different ones.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.080]   You got you got squirt, the sick dog, kazoo, bubbler, Howard, the duck, Jack, the ripper,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   the hammer.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.360]   Like was when Leo was in France.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.560]   Oh, I could have used this in France.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   Whoa.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   All right.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.160]   That's really silly, but 99 cents.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   Could you charge $2 for that?
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   I don't think so.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.960]   Yeah, but 99 cents.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.260]   You're like, that's it.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.960]   I love that they were debating the price of the fart application.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.560]   Well, the question is like, but then you look at it like I beer is 199.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.360]   I mean, that's cheeky.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   That's all I got a cheeky, but they're making good money too.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.960]   I want I'm trying to think what song you should have on your ringtone for me.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.360]   I think I'm a loser, baby.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.560]   I think the reason the reason you don't have a ringtone is because you I don't know what
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.360]   number I don't know what your number is.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.160]   It's always different.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   It's always like it's I have like six numbers that are Leo LePorte numbers and I don't know
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   which one to.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.660]   So here we go.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.660]   Here we go.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.660]   Here we go.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.660]   Big Apple rumor.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   This is the big one.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.660]   The iPhone nano.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.660]   Oh, gosh.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.760]   I think that's almost beat.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.360]   I mean, you have companies that are already advertising the cases.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   Stupid.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   What would an iPhone nano even be?
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.960]   I'll be more than I.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.560]   I'll tell you that.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.060]   It's certainly going to be followed, however, by the iPhone shuffle where you randomly phone
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.060]   people.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.160]   Oh, yeah, we talked about that before.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.560]   Only only for use when you're drunk.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.960]   Well, I mean, in many ways, I think it makes sense because it is a it sucks all the oxygen
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.360]   if if they released it and if it was $99, it would really suck all the oxygen out of the
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   out of the system.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   Did we do?
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.800]   Did we point out that today is the day that the Walmart iPhone sales start?
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.960]   Not for $99 left.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   Yeah, $9,097.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   $3.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   Yeah, $2 off.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   Oh, such a deal.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.880]   Such a deal.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   So there.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.960]   Well, I should mention the refurbished iPhones are 99 bucks.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.200]   If you really want to go that way for it for an eight gig, you can get one from Apple
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.360]   or AT&T, I guess, for 99 bucks.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.920]   That's a good deal.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.240]   And I think that I said, I think it makes sense for Apple to release something that's
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   smaller that for the people who are right on that edge and they don't want to pay the
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   $199.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.760]   They don't know if they I would never get one.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.720]   I mean, to me, you know, once I went in thinking, oh, maybe I'll get an eight gig.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:07.120]   And of course I didn't even think about not having I mean, I would love to buy a 32.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.600]   I would have paid, you know, $3.99 for a 32 gig phone because mine's full all the time.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.840]   I have a 32 gig touch and it's really nice.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.480]   I have to say though, you know, I brought touches on the trip to France for Henry and
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.000]   Jennifer.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.920]   And you know, there are so many great games on the touch now.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   Sim City just came out.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.320]   It's excellent that except it crashes every five minutes.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.080]   But other than that, it's great.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   I'm sure they'll fix that.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.000]   You really was a great entertainment device for him.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.800]   I mean, he had all his music on it and all these great games on it.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   It's pretty and the farm machine, which really got, you know, the next row behind him really
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.680]   cleared out actually after a little while.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   Oh boy.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.960]   What is the French word for fart?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.800]   My French vocabulary does not go that deeply.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.520]   But I know how I react to every fart I run into.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.720]   Oh, my dude, my dude, sacri bleh.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.520]   Wasn't Le Petomaine French?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.320]   Maybe they named it after him.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   Who?
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   Le Petomaine.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   You mean the pedophile?
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:20.240]   No, no, no, he was a very, very famous performer who did an entire like, abery act based on
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.360]   from from a lower air output ventricle.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.160]   That he, like one that one would use once on the stage is a new meaning to Pepe Le Pew.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.320]   I could tell you that.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.680]   Well, no, no, see, he would start.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   It's he's a legend.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.760]   He was he he would start every performance by talking about this wonderful diet that
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.280]   he took to make sure that his emissions were out of.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   Okay.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   All right.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   All right.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.680]   At least I'm at least I'm being a historian about this and so I'm just like, I can't
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   help it.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:59.880]   HP has announced an update to its media smart home server with iTunes serving in it.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Who cares?
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   I don't care.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   You care?
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   It's got a lot of that.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   This got a lot of press for reasons.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.240]   I'm not sure I understand.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   Most Linux based NAS is already support the iTunes.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   Don't they?
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.240]   I don't think this is a I mean, you know, this means.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.560]   Oh, all the people who run Windows can now run an iTunes media server.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   I don't know.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   I'm in my fart.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   French is pet pet.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   Thank you.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   Yeah, I I mean, I'm quite happy with my Drobo.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.520]   I don't really know why I would do you do you use Drobo share?
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.360]   No, I'm just using Drobo for for my Oh, you mean this is for like over the internet?
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   This is a NAS.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.640]   It's a no it's a HP is the it's the Windows home server.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   I haven't used the Drobo.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.320]   I have a Drobo share and I haven't used it in connection with iTunes.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.640]   I haven't used it actually.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.880]   Well, my my IT guy built I think he used Drobo share as part of it, but he built some kind
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.360]   of way we actually built a wide area network.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.280]   So my Drobo gets updated at my home eight miles away from my office.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   That's very cool.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.440]   I have no idea by the way how it works.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.960]   It will also support time capsule, which is kind of interesting.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.040]   I think it's the only NAS that works as a time capsule.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.680]   You guys use time capsule?
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   No, no.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   I do.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:15.880]   In the in the sense that I'm getting it for free and I had to turn off for the longest
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.520]   time.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:23.880]   And now I find that well on the if I if I can get this sort of additional backup that works
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.040]   in the background across my network without my having to touch it, maintain it or think
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.200]   about it.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.800]   I'm absolutely certain that it will save my butt at some point in the future.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.960]   I mean, I'm not sure that I would spend a large amount of my extra discretionary income
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   on it.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.000]   But if I were looking to rebuild my network, if I was starting with it with an empty house
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.040]   and I'm like, okay, I need to have a base station.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   I need to have a bridge.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.360]   I need to have this and that the other.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.280]   I certainly might spend a little bit extra to get the time capsule to say, you know what?
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.200]   It'll have a half terabyte or one terabyte drive.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:02.040]   My laptop, iMac and my girlfriends laptop will all be backed up automatically.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.720]   And I'll never have to think about it.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.040]   But again, at some point the laptop will be stolen or a hard rival crash.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.920]   I'll think, my God, I'm totally screwed.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.160]   But then I'll realize, oh, wait a minute, this thing that I didn't really like and didn't
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.840]   really think about automatically backed up my hard drive on the hour.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.280]   I can't see that as a bad thing.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.840]   No, I guess my thing is that I generate too much content.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.800]   You can't get a big enough drive to do it.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.080]   I mean, I generate probably two to four gigabytes a day, but you shouldn't be backing all that
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   up.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.040]   So you just, yeah, I mean, you know what, all that stuff permanently.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   No, I don't.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   But that's the issue.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   Well, you tell it.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040]   I don't say don't back this stuff up.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:42.360]   Yeah, I have my regime is just the I'm at gets back up on the hour.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.280]   My Mac book gets backed up on the hour.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.400]   I do have the Drobo, which is now up to about two and a half terabytes, maybe three terabytes
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.680]   protected storage.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.800]   That stuff is in a sense backed up in that it contains duplicates of things that I went
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.840]   when I put new video, new photos on it.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.120]   I also burn a DVD because it's never a good idea to have one copy of anything.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.560]   But I mean, you know, the whole idea of backing up is to come up with the regime that you
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.200]   will actually work and will actually stick with.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.480]   And again, that's why I think the time capsule is a really good solution.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.040]   Do it, set it up once, never think about it ever again.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.680]   The weakness of time machine is that on my I'm Mac, I might be able to have an external
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.840]   drive plugged in and operating 24 seven, but that's never going to work on my Mac book.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:32.160]   This is something Apple could announce though at Mac world is some sort of server kind of
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   thing.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   Maybe I just feel like it would be shiny and overpriced for what I need for having, but
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.920]   having really, but you're a pro, you're pro though.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   You do stuff.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   You do.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.000]   I mean, you're not a typical user in this respect.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.720]   Yeah, because I guess I'm just sensitive to the fact that storage space for us.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.600]   I mean, when you when close storage space, when you buy it is so much more expensive.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   Right.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.440]   And yeah, people like you buy hard drives by the the dozen 20 a week.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   Yeah, no, actually, we just got news that Alex bought Western digital.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.600]   You would save you money actually.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   It would.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.720]   I think for the amount of money, you know, it's really funny is getting ramping out to
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.560]   go through customs in Japan with 26 hard drives.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   What?
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.720]   Well, what I would I would even fit that even goes over 50 pounds in your luggage surprisingly,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.280]   surprisingly, it does not.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.320]   It turns out that the carry on luggage that I have actually fits, you know, one of those
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.240]   styrofoam things and carry around 25 hard drives in your backpack.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.720]   No, no, no, no, and I had a pool roll on.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   Oh, roll on.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.520]   So I had a roll on with 20.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.360]   It had 20 hard drives and had the little styrofoam.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.680]   I'm surprised that they didn't stop your custom or something.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.160]   I mean, that was funny was that I was concerned about them.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.640]   So you're a data smuggler.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.440]   So so so so what I did is I listed on the in the in the I listed everything.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.440]   That's fine.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.760]   You're technically supposed to do anything over $100, which I have a lot of.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   Right.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.720]   And so not only I didn't just put 26 hard drives, I had a laptop, my camera, my camera, you
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:09.680]   know, memory my and then and oh, by the way, there's a 26 hard drives and yeah.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.480]   And so there's this huge long list on the back of all the things and it looks like I'm
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.840]   just being overly careful.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.440]   And the and the value wasn't of the drives.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.480]   Raw aren't more than my laptop.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.000]   So it's not like it was like a big price either.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And so I listed all of I just listed absolutely everything I could think of that was worth
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.280]   more than $100.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.040]   And I handed to the guy and of course he just looked at it and said, is this all yours?
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   And I was like, yep.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.680]   And he's like, okay, he didn't say, what are you doing?
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   What are you where you going?
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   Why do you want questions?
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   No questions.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   It's interesting.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:44.480]   You know, it was Japan is is was remarkably, Japan and Amsterdam were the two easiest in an
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   ounce of customs.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   Amsterdam doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   But Japan does a little bit.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.760]   Yeah, Amsterdam, they don't they don't even they don't ask you anything.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   They just want it.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.400]   But you gave a passport and stamp it and handed back to you.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.920]   They give you a map to the red light district and say, go on in there.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:04.240]   You're well, you know, the the guy that is in charge of the Amsterdam custom services,
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   don't you?
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   No, who?
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   Schultz.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   I see nothing.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   No, nothing.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   Exactly.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240]   I know nothing.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.000]   Like how how badly could a random listener of this podcast screw up your life if they decided
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.040]   to build like an empty traveling case that look that basically hollow out hard drive
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   mechanisms, you could carry stuff inside it invisibly and make a big show about about
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.840]   selling it on the internet.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   That would just.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.160]   Yeah, I'm sure that's going to be.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   I'm sorry, Mr. Lindsey.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.800]   We're going to have to unscrew all of these hard drives or we can L X Ray them.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.960]   Well, you do get the little nice note every every time you run anything like that through,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.240]   you know, if you check it, you get the little nice note every single time.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.440]   You just imagine someone looking at the X ray just going what what what and because usually
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.120]   it's it's not just that it's combined with all the wiring that goes with it and everything
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   else.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.640]   It has to look ominous when it goes.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.440]   Sir, I haven't seen one of my kids piano recitals all season long and you're going to
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.360]   keep me here an extra half an hour to scan every one of these things.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.840]   Well, let me tell you, sir.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.320]   I'm trying to be a good parent.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   I draw it.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.440]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.000]   And I'm sure we've got some good ones.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.960]   Our last show of the year, maybe we could maybe we should do something special like the best,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.360]   you know, thing of the year or something like that.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.600]   I'll give you a minute to think about it.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.160]   Well, I mentioned our favorite advertiser of the year.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.160]   We've had a lot of them.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.880]   It's hard to pick just one, but audible has really been there for us this year and we
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   really thank them.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.680]   They've advertised on all our shows.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.440]   Audible has actually been a boon to the podcast industry.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.160]   I know they advertise with many of your shows too, guys.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.960]   They are just the best.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.400]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash Mac break.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.360]   That's the place to go to get your audible book, your free book, you know, you go there,
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:56.760]   you get a credit when you sign up for any book in the audible, vast audible library.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.640]   And there are so many great choices.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.360]   Andy, you've been, I haven't talked to you in a while.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.080]   Have you have you been reading, you're listening or are you too busy with your, I have robot?
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.960]   I have been reading and I have been listening.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.400]   I am nearly done with last week's pick, 'Round the World in 80 Days' by Michael Palin.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.880]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   I want to listen to that too.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.560]   I have that on my list.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.240]   Again, Michael Palin, especially in audio book format, he's one of those names where if
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.160]   you don't know, if you have a subscription where, you know, you get a free book, excuse
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.240]   me, you get a prepaid book every single month and you don't know what you want to get.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.360]   One of the go-to names is, well, let's just search for Michael Palin.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.360]   Right.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.080]   He's a great diarist, he reads everything that he's written himself and it's always something
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.320]   interesting in a new world perspective and places you've never been to and things you
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.800]   never really thought about.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.600]   But it's now, it's at the end of the month and now I know that, you know, that free credit,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.560]   excuse me, I'm sorry, that prepaid credit is about to land in my account again.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:58.480]   And I used to be a lot more venal when it comes to getting these, spending this one credit.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:04.040]   And I wanted to make it sure that, you know, as a big fan as I am of audible and as much
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.360]   as I credit them with keeping my sanity during all these like hour long drives I have to
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:14.840]   do every single week to go visit my dad and stuff, they are still technically the man.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.280]   And I am as ever friend of the proletariat and hated enemy of the man.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.280]   The man.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   The man.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   So exactly.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:28.600]   So it's good every now and then to look for those enormously just absurdly long audio
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.800]   books that cost one credit.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.160]   So this one, I almost don't need to tell you what the title is or the author.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.440]   All I need to tell you is that it is 32 hours and two minutes.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.600]   Unabridged one credit.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.000]   Take that man.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.560]   So we don't even care if it's any good.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   Exactly.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.040]   You're sticking it right to the man.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.160]   Well, what is this fabulous tome?
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.760]   You've probably heard of it is Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   Oh, I read it.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   I love that.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   I listened to that.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   That was a great book.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.440]   And unfortunately, this is one of those books where I bought it because it passed my three
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.480]   flip rule at the bookstore where you flip to three random pages.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.720]   And if you if each time you can't stop reading that one page, you know that, okay, I'm taking
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.280]   this home with me for whatever reason I just never got past the first three chapters.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.960]   I think was one of those things where some project hit me just as I was starting to get
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   into it.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.480]   It's a little slow and it's it's it's almost Victorian.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.280]   And it's a you know, kind of elaborateness.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.840]   Yeah, it's Victorian setting.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.640]   It's it's a Victorian era England in which magic is actually starting to come back into
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.200]   a resurgence thanks to the help of two individuals.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.600]   So it's like alternative.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.800]   It's like alternative history coupled with fantasy.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.240]   And it was definitely one of those things where again, turn the lights down low, pour yourself
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.680]   a glass of something comforting.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.960]   Turn off some, but not all the lights and just is it is it well read?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.000]   Yes, I've I haven't bought it yet.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.800]   I have listened to the sample and it's narrated by Simon Preble.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.320]   Oh, he's the best.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   Right.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   He's one of their best readers.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.080]   I love him and very nice, very soothing.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.560]   I'm again, 32 hours and two minutes long.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.920]   The problem is I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish it by the time I get my next prepaid.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.800]   But again, the man will be stuck to such a deal.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.000]   You know, they also have right now, they have their special half price deal.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.360]   They do a lot of sales all year long on Audible.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.920]   They're eight 95 holiday relief sale, 95 books for less than nine bucks.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.960]   So there's some really good choices in there too.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:38.600]   If you want to go a la carte, but I suggest signing up for the gold subscription audible.com/macbreak.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.080]   You know, take it, stick it to the man.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.080]   Get that book, that credit Twitter free book, get doc, what is it?
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.240]   The strange case of Mr. Norell and doctor, what is it?
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.160]   Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.800]   Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.480]   I Susanna Clark loved it.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.640]   I loved it.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.240]   And I think I actually now I think about it.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.080]   I don't think I listened to it.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.640]   I think I read it.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.200]   So I will have to get the audible version of it.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.360]   Audible is a great way to read books because even if you've already read them, because
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   it's like being read too.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.320]   And when it's a great narrator, it's such a wonderful performance.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.080]   But the weird thing is it's a psychological thing.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:19.320]   I may not necessarily determine to buy a new novel at the bookstore every single month.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   But if you had it with Barnes and O'Litt said, look, we will give just pay us half cost
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.800]   of any bestseller.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.520]   And we will let you get pretty much any book that we have one a month.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.760]   We'll be happy if you buy more, but for this amount of money, you can take your pick of
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.760]   these $40, $30, $40, $50 books.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.200]   It sort of encourages you to say, oh, geez, I got this credit coming.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   What am I going to spend it on?
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   It lets you be a little bit more adventurous.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.560]   And again, I'm definitely trying a lot of stuff that I might not have tried otherwise.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.280]   Strange and Norrell, wonderful book.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   Highly recommended.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.320]   I've read it.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.560]   And Simon Preble reads it for you.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.000]   Audible.com/MacBreak, we thank them so much for their support.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.440]   We'll back break weekly.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.320]   Now time for our last pick of the year.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.200]   Scott Borne, I'm going to give you the pride of place here.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   You get to start us.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.400]   Oh, such pressure, such pressure.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.000]   The pressure's on.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.160]   Well, every week somebody sneaks in too, but since you said we were going to talk about
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.480]   maybe our best of the year.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.840]   I just made that up.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.600]   It certainly don't feel a burden to do that.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.800]   Well, here's what I'm going to do too.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.480]   One will be the one I had already for this week and one will be my favorite for the whole
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   year.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   Oh, perfect.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   Thank you.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.080]   So my favorite for this week, yes, it's photography related.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080]   Yes.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.560]   And I'll bring in for aperture and photo.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.160]   Let me guess, does it come from Nick software?
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.960]   It does not.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.760]   It comes from one of their competitors.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.800]   Tiffin, Tiffin, they make the little lenses.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.360]   They make regular little filters.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   Filters, yeah.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.080]   You used to carry in the old days in your bag.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.360]   But they also make a wonderful thing called the Tiffin D like dog, F like Frank, X like
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.880]   X ray, DFX plug in, which is digital filter software.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   And oh my goodness, is it cool.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:11.160]   From aperture to DFX, I've been able to make images look amazingly good and they use the
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.520]   Roscoe gels.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.960]   Alex will know what that means.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   Don't you out?
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   Yep.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.880]   Those are like the famous official big deal movie gels that movie companies use.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.440]   They first use those with a little rascals films to make the kids seem younger.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   Yeah, they use.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   I'm making that up.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.240]   He just went right for that.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.600]   That way it works for me.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   It's your story.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.400]   Tell it anyway.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.800]   I think that it is really well implemented.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:42.480]   They've licensed these amongst a bunch of other cool effects and they allow you to use
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.880]   presets, make your own presets.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   It's about 300 bucks.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.960]   It's not cheap, but it is really outstanding.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:56.640]   And it does things like masking and layering, which have here to four not really been available
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.200]   in aperture since aperture is not a pixel editing program.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:05.480]   So they've come up with their own version of this much like Nick uses its UPoint technology.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.200]   Tiffin has a version of masking and layering.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.480]   There's a little bit of a learning curve.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.640]   It's worth it.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.600]   And I invite everybody to check it out.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.040]   I believe there is a free download available at Tiffin TIFFEN.com.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.520]   But now for my pick of the year, I have to say you're right.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.800]   It is from Nick Software.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.000]   It's Silver Effects Pro.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.120]   You know, by the way, my brother just got in, just started using it and he is.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.760]   So, so just loves it.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.400]   I spent 18 years printing in a wet dark room.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.040]   And I never made a black and white print in all that time that I liked any better than
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:48.880]   I got off of my Epson 3800 yesterday using exhibition fiber print paper and photographs
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.000]   I created an aperture and ran through the Silver Effects Pro plugin to making the black
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.560]   and white unbelievable Leo.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.720]   It is just simply unbelievable.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.320]   And they've lowered the prices on all the Nick Software.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.360]   It's available for aperture at a particularly attractive price.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.920]   But whatever it costs, if you're into black and white, there's literally no better way
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   to get it.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.360]   And I think they deserve the product of the year.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.720]   We gave them the product of the year on tWITPhoto.com.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.880]   And by the way, not now.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.640]   Never have been nor likely to be a sponsor of anything I do.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.160]   Why not?
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   Because they're cheap.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   I don't know.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   Oh, you've tried.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.480]   I probably help them sell like a million copies of this stuff.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.280]   They say, thanks.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.440]   But it is really good.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.600]   So check either one of those out.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.040]   They're both good if you use aperture or photoshop.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.840]   Well, I'm going to step in here and do my pick.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.640]   That's a great pick.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:47.000]   And this one really came home to me during the trip because I brought Lightroom 2 with
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   me.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   And they updated it to 2.2.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:55.960]   Thank goodness while I was on the road because 2.2 finally adds the Adobe Camera Raw for
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   the 5D Mark II and the Lumix LX3.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.880]   So what I was doing is running them both through the digital negative.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.200]   By the way, this is a useful thing to know about Adobe has a free DNG converter.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.920]   They'll take those files from the Lumix and the Mark II and convert them to DNG, which
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.280]   then means anything can read it.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.840]   So that's what I was doing an extra step.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.280]   Now the Adobe Lightroom 2.2 supports those cameras.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.080]   And I tell you, boy, I know you love aperture, Scott.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:27.560]   And I certainly don't knock aperture, but I have to say, the more I use Lightroom, the
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.720]   more I appreciate it.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.600]   Really great for my workflow.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.320]   And I think anybody who's halfway serious about photography, not as serious as Scott
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   is.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.440]   Something like me who's halfway serious about photography.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.360]   So it's good for people that are halfway serious.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.360]   Halfway serious.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.520]   This is a must have.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   I don't have the time to mess with those photographs.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.480]   But when you're shooting in raw, you've got to at least import these things, do a white
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   balance.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:55.680]   I'm not such a good photographer, so I often have to crop to get the image that I thought
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.480]   I was taking.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.160]   And Lightroom just is so great for that.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.960]   Also, every once in a while, I'll have a bright spot.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.200]   I can burn it very nicely.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.440]   The new 2.0 Lightroom just really does a nice job with this kind of area, the ability to
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   do.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.920]   I guess it's what that masking filter from Tiffin does.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.840]   Do small areas of it and modify little bits of it.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.120]   Yeah, they have got a new in ACR actually.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.280]   It's not just in Lightroom, but in Photoshop, ACR allows you to do some selective corrections.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.280]   Right.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.560]   Lightroom is essentially ACR with a bunch of wrapping around it.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   The raw conversion part of Lightroom is nearly identical to the ACR converter in Photoshop,
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:40.640]   although speaking based on some interviews I've had with Adobe, there are some slight
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   differences.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.440]   In fact, there may be one or two features in ACR for Lightroom that you don't find in
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   Photoshop.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.320]   Or at least there was before CS4, that might have gained parity.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.120]   I have them compared to them.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   They're pretty similar.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.840]   I think because Lightroom was a step ahead in development, maybe they added features that
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.000]   are now incorporated into Adobe Camera Raw in Photoshop.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.720]   I love the...
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.360]   You're a pro.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.320]   Don't you think the ACR engine is really the best way to handle raw files?
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.440]   You like aperture better?
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.600]   I don't think there's a right way or wrong way.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.720]   I'll answer it like that.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.880]   I think that it's sort of like chocolate ice cream, strawberry ice cream.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.880]   It's all ice cream.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:25.360]   I personally find the raw converter in aperture to be more to my liking.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:31.520]   However, if I maybe one time out of a thousand run into a really problematic photo, I will
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.520]   take it into ACR.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   It's good to have both.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.960]   I think ACR is a great converter.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:42.320]   There's certainly a standard that many people use, but I'm very fond of the aperture converter
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.200]   and I have a workflow that, like you said, Leo, you hit the magic words.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.360]   It's a matter of what works for you and your workflow.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.360]   Yeah, and you have a good...
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.360]   Go ahead.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.600]   You can download them both for free and trial.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.600]   And you have a...
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   You're a pro.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   Look, and you've been doing this, as you said.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.560]   You've been doing wet stuff for years.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.880]   I'm not anywhere in that category.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:07.360]   I am a passionate amateur, but I just think that Lightroom is so great and it's...
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.960]   It made it very easy for me.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:15.280]   Took a thousand pictures in France in one night to go through them, flag them, fix them,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.720]   and upload them to... I have Flickr and a Smug Mug plugins, upload them and get them up there.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   And it just...
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.720]   It really is great.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   A couple of things.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   I did some processing.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   There's some presets in there.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   I just...
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.120]   I really love Lightroom and I think Lightroom 2.2 because it now supports the two cameras
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.640]   that I really use all the time.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.040]   I just have to say, I just adore it.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.280]   I'm just very, very happy with it.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.360]   Let me off to think about my favorite program of the year, though.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.960]   That's a tough one.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.800]   I'll tell you, there are a few that I use day in, day out.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:50.880]   There are classics like Panic Software's Transmit, which I still think is the best FTP program
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.840]   I've ever used.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.680]   Mars Edit, which is what I use to blog, is just spectacular from our friend Daniel Jockert.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:02.120]   I'm a big fan of a feeder.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.960]   That's kind of a specialized program, but that's...
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.080]   We couldn't do any of our shows without it.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.560]   That's how we post our podcasts.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   It's a RSS creator for podcasting.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.720]   You didn't say we got like six picks in a year.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.480]   I can't pick just one.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   It's a chip tier.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   I can't pick just one.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.480]   I can't pick just one.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   I can't pick just one.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   I just want...
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   I just want...
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   I just want...
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   I just want...
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   If we have more categories, we get more sponsorships.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   It's like the webbies.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   It's like the webbies.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   It's like the webbies.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.480]   Anyway, I'll stop there.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.920]   And we'll move to Mr. Andrew and Notco for his pick of the week.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   Well, I'm going to do pick of the year because I have an annual end of the year tradition, which
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.080]   is to rip off an idea from Oprah Winfrey.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.880]   I do that every year.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.120]   I rip off an idea from Oprah.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.120]   What are you going to do?
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.320]   You rip off an idea from a dumb person who's not successful?
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   There you go.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.840]   Hey, smart man.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.440]   So yes, at the end of the year, I do my favorite things column, which has the exact same premise
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.600]   as her show.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   It's not necessarily...
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.280]   This is the most innovative thing of the year.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   Products that came out in 2008.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.480]   These are things that I like so much that after reviewing them, they just became part
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   of my daily routine.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   Well, let me think.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:13.360]   Like paper packages wrapped up in string.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.480]   With a dying adorable baby duck.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.920]   These are a few of my favorite things.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   All right, go ahead.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.400]   What do you got?
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.640]   I got a bunch.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.720]   I'm trying to think of just one.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.400]   I did four.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   Let's Scott Stu.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   Go ahead.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Big as many as you want.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   I'll do three and I'll build.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   I know what number one is.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.160]   I'll go from three to one.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.160]   Okay.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.240]   So let's just say the co-winner of the number two slot, because not one is better than the
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   other.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.600]   One would be the Drobo.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.680]   Awesome.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.760]   Because it's really...
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.920]   I really think it's the natural way that you...
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.440]   The only way that you can now do a huge capacity drive now.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.800]   It was one thing when you had a 500 gigabyte drive.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.880]   When you try to go into multiple terabytes of capacity.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.080]   And now we're in a situation where you're requiring so much high definition video and
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.920]   photos and media and all this sort of stuff, where you can no longer spread things out
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   amongst...
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.160]   Spread out your risk amongst multiple drives.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:15.560]   You need to have a single large mass storage device that gives really good solid and trustworthy
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.960]   protection to your data.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960]   Of course you do.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:24.760]   And every single common sense thing about storing data continues to be true with the
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   Drobo.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.240]   It doesn't really serve as its own backup device.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.320]   And you don't want to have your one copy of anything on OneDrive.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.840]   That's why again, when I import photos into the Drobo, I also burn them onto a DVD so
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.560]   I have a copy of it somewhere.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.320]   When I rip a DVD, well I still have a physical DVD.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.960]   So it's all there somewhere.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.560]   But it is incredibly easy to maintain.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.320]   I have consummate faith in it.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.560]   We had the new house.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.880]   We had the first power outage.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.440]   While I was away, power was lost three times.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.080]   And of course the Drobo is tied into my iMac and it stays on 24/7.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.200]   It had absolutely no problems riding up the power failure.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.320]   Even though that was before I had hooked up my UPS to it.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.160]   Because even if power goes out while data is being written to the Drobo, it's smart enough
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.760]   to know that okay, I shouldn't just cut the power.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.320]   I'll remember what I was supposed to be doing.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.620]   And so when you turn it back on again, they'll just simply be an amber light that says,
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:29.040]   by the way, I'm going to need a minute after you plug me back in to sort of collect myself.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.980]   And everything is perfectly right as rain.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.740]   So I have absolute belief in it.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.160]   I also love the fact that you can just keep tossing more drives in it and keep making
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   it larger and larger and larger.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.480]   Love it, love it, love it.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.200]   The other, the code number two is the Flip Mino HD.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.480]   You do love your mine, don't you?
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:53.600]   It really, see, the tip off is that I absolutely used to be one of those guys who just went
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.860]   and would never want to shoot video.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.220]   I love taking pictures.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.980]   I've been a photo, not all my life, but I've always said that the reason why I prefer taking
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:05.000]   pictures to taking video is because with the camera, I'm tied up for one two hundred
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.380]   and fiftyth of a second.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.300]   With a video camera, I have to stand there like an idiot holding this thing.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.820]   If something cool is happening in front of me for 10 minutes, well, I'm not really enjoying
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.260]   the cool thing that's happening in front of me.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:19.020]   I'm actually holding up this camera and looking at what's happening in the screen.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.180]   The Mino HD totally changed that because now this is something that can happen.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:27.400]   One little pouch in my pants pocket that I, again, it's so small that not only does
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.840]   fit into a pocket, but I don't know what pocket it's actually in.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.240]   Time and time again, it happens all the time though.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.700]   It's like something really cool is happening in front of me.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.440]   I know I'll shoot some video of this.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.840]   That's made me more interested in shooting better videos.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.400]   It's become maybe more interested in video editing.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.600]   The whole point of having this technology is not just to make your life easier, but
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.840]   to sort of expand your feature set so that by your next birthday, next year, you know
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.280]   things and you can do things you couldn't do last year.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.660]   And for that reason, the Mino HD has really, really been a winner for me.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.280]   I'm just really, really pleased with it.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.200]   Although I have to say that I'm, so I've been testing out the creative, creative's new
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.440]   Vado HD for the past two or three weeks.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.960]   It's a very, very close race between them.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.400]   I still think that the Mino HD takes the highest quality video between the two, but there's
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.920]   definitely going to be a follow up very, very shortly in which I show you all the really,
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.480]   really awesomely, awesomely bad video I shot for the other one.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.040]   But the number one slot always was known about six or seven months ago.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.360]   It is the word processor known as Scrivener.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360]   Yes.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:41.640]   It is, you know, if the Ninja movie, the samurai movie in which the samurai finds a gun that's
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.760]   so good that he puts away his swords forever, that must be one hell of a gun.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.240]   And that's what Scrivener represents to me for all my entire career.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.840]   I've used Microsoft Word and BB Edit as my word processors.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.520]   Microsoft Word for books and stuff that requires really complicated formatting and a real word
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.000]   processor, but BB Edit for every single one of my newspaper columns, every single one
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.680]   of my online columns, just everything.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.840]   I checked out Scrivener for the first time in January and five days later, I never touched
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.560]   BB Edit as a word processor ever again.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:21.320]   And I've only launched Word when chapters of my books come back from editing and outhouse
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.080]   all this markup stuff that the Scrivener can't handle.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:33.080]   It is by far the key 21st century word processor that understands that the role of a word processor
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.280]   is not preparing stuff to come out of a printer.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:41.680]   The key role of a word processor is just to get ideas out of your head and into a document
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680]   window.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.760]   It's very well who cares.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.280]   But just a simple fact that it knows that when I'm writing a SunTimes column, my SunTimes
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.360]   editor likes a plain text column.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.880]   It knows that my Mac world editor likes a Microsoft Word document.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.960]   It knows that I'm running something for another website.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.480]   It wants plain text that can be exported to this other application.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.640]   It knows all that stuff automatically.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.880]   Every single one of my SunTimes columns is in one little binder.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.640]   Every single one of my project files related to every other project is in its own special
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.760]   little binder.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.560]   I cannot recommend this highly enough.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.480]   It's the best 40 bucks I ever spent on anything related to my job ever.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.120]   Excellent.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.880]   I would have picked Drobo, but I was trying to avoid sponsors because I didn't want to
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   seem cheeky.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.680]   But since we're going to do that, I would certainly add Drobo to my list.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.400]   It's given me peace of mind that my 401k, if you will, my 500,000 photograph library
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.720]   that I intend to rely on in my old age for income is in fact safe no matter what.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.600]   Drobo did not sponsor this show, so that's perfect.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   Although they come and go.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.520]   I think they'll be back next week.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520]   We have a Drobo.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.840]   They gave us a Drobo for our giveaway with the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.320]   We had it custom painted to match the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.960]   You ought to see this most beautiful Drobo you ever saw with these blue flames on it.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.200]   It's really gorgeous.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.280]   Next time you really want to see flames come through.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   Hey, they're blue.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   It's cool.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   It's okay.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.840]   I love all six of my Drobo's.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:17.920]   Yeah, I actually have, we actually are now supplying a lot of our vendors.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.360]   When we give them something, we're giving them three terabytes of information.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.360]   Wow.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   Just give them a Drobo.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.840]   We're now, that's kind of like part of the package.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   That's really great.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.040]   We just hand them a drink.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   They love it.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.920]   You just give them, here's the Drobo of all your information.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.320]   It's kind of a nice added.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.200]   They can do whatever they want with it afterwards, but that's how we're delivering.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200]   Wow.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.040]   I can build that in, of course, to the billing price plus 20%.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.000]   Well, it's a profit thing.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.680]   It all works out in the wash.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.000]   So Alex, your turn, your picks?
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:01.200]   So my pick for the week is connected to this thing that I've kind of, one of our producers
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   got me hooked into.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.160]   Aaron Mailer, who's the producer for Twib, gets me hooked on these things.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.160]   There was this blobby game that he got me hooked on.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   World of Goo.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.840]   Yeah, you got us hooked on that after that.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.680]   There's now one for the iPhone called Tiki Towers.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   Tiki Towers.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.960]   Tiki Towers.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.080]   And I don't know why I'm so, I don't know why this particular type of game.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   Does it do this?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   I don't like, does it do this?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   What's games?
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.680]   I don't like, admittedly it doesn't do that.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.080]   It doesn't make you, yeah, the funny thing about it is I think it's just that I can,
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.280]   I don't like anything that's particularly complex.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.640]   Usually when I'm playing a game, it's one of those things that's happening because I'm
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.640]   waiting for somebody.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.920]   You know, I'm waiting for something or I'm waiting, you know, I was in a van an hour,
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.840]   two hours a day when I was in Japan.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   So, so it's something that I just want to fill a little bit of time with and I just
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.720]   want to be able to take it and go.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.800]   And it's just, and it, but it also kind of stretches my mind.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.560]   So, so anyway, Tiki Towers is my favorite thing of the week.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.400]   As far as I was trying to think of the things that I use all the time, as far as my, my
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.760]   picks of the, of the year.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:19.680]   And I think that the, as far as software goes, that I think that for me, one of the ones
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.640]   that I use a lot, I mean, we use in the company a lot is I show you, which is our, a lot of
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.840]   people ask me how we do our screencasts.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.920]   And for both our own work, our clients work, the thing that we use 80% of the time, there
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.920]   are a handful of times where we're still using snaps to capture stuff because of performance
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.720]   issues, but generally almost everything is done with I show you because it's instant.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.680]   You know, you capture something and we do it all the time just for taking notes.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.840]   Like if I'm trying to explain how to do something to somebody, I rarely will try to type it
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   out now.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:56.400]   I mean, I literally just open up, I show you, I, I select a window and I, and then I quickly,
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.960]   you know, do a little capture talking.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.160]   I've done one walking with my laptop down the hallway and saying, okay, this is what
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   you want to do.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.800]   And then boom, email it to them and it's done.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.280]   And they actually know what they're, and it's not very expensive.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.640]   It's 20 bucks or something like that.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.520]   So I just love that application and we use it all the time.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.120]   And so that's, that's one that I think is, you know, really, really useful for us.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.600]   Transmit, of course, is something that we use, you know, I use daily.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.600]   Such a program.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.800]   It's just part of the infrastructure.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.760]   I mean, it's such a, it's so well laid out and, and so easy to use.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.280]   The other one that I like a lot is handbrake.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.640]   So those are my three like software things as far as hardware goes.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   I guess Mac related.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.200]   I don't know if it's Mac related, but I love my LX three.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.680]   I got it just before I left for some time.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.200]   Is that a great camera?
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.680]   My wife loves it.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   She's, she used.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.120]   I shot, I shot probably 3000 photos and two hours of video on it, you know, while I was,
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   while I was there.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.960]   And what's amazing is is the AI, they have this little AI setting and it's insanely
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   accurate.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.120]   I mean, the, the, the shoot I a, which is not raw, it's JPEG.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.320]   But I a, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.880]   You know, I, the one, the one problem with the LX three is, is that if I guess if you're
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.480]   not using Lightroom, using raw with their little silky picks thing or whatever.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480]   I know.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.560]   It's enough to push you to Lightroom and I've actually installed Lightroom on here to start
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.640]   playing with it because the other thing is use that try that Adobe D&J effort.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.280]   Because that was just a whole conversion.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:27.360]   The, the, the, what's nice about the JPEG stuff and generally when I, when I, for the last
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.460]   month and a half, what I've had is three cameras with me.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.560]   So I've had the LX three.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:37.600]   I have, of course, my Canon SLR, my 20D, which I'm going to replace soon.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.200]   And, and then I have a Rico R 10.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.580]   And the reason that I have the Rico is because it's the only still camera that I could find
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:50.280]   that will do time lapse without added added things.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.720]   So I can just, I can just hook it up and run it for a time lapse.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.240]   And it's the only one that I found that will, that will do it at full resolution.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.160]   So I can do 2500 or whatever.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.120]   I mean, the G9 will do it, but it's in 640 by 480 movies.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.080]   You have to add pieces and you don't really want to do time lapse with a, with a Canon,
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:13.360]   with an SLR because, you know, they're only rated for lifting that mirror so many times.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.200]   And so if you start running a thousand, thousand photos at a time, you'll burn up that mirror.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.280]   It's not designed for that.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.960]   So you, so anyway, so I have these three cameras that I'm kind of shuffling about.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.200]   And so if I'm taking really important pictures that I want in raw, I'm usually taking
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.720]   it with my SOR.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.040]   What I really use the, the LX34 is I have a camera in my pocket all the time.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.640]   I pull it out and I take photos.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.480]   And, and the thing is, is the JPEG works, you know, for the, for what I'm using it for,
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.840]   works just fine.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.680]   And the, the IAA or AI or whatever, it is amazing.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.920]   It grabs onto people's photo.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.120]   It grabs onto people's spaces.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.640]   It grabs onto, and for what I'm using it for, I just want to remember this or I just
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.800]   want to grab this or I want to shoot some behind the scenes or whatever.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.200]   It is amazingly accurate.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.680]   You know, I, I'm just blown away by how well it works.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:05.560]   And it actually is so good, Alex, that I've actually got a print that was full size, submitted
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.760]   to a magazine and they bought it and it was shot at ISO 80 LX for J-bit.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   Wow.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.520]   And it, and it, and it, and it looked good.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.920]   There's a lot of the pro stuff I've done.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.080]   I do have one question.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.040]   Did, did your LX3 make the trip back?
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   It did.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.040]   Oddly enough.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   What was it?
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.040]   What was the deal?
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   Were you worried about it?
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.760]   No, I, I have a history of losing chunks of electronics, including my camera.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.800]   And everyone reminds me of it constantly.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.400]   So I got, I, as I was getting ready to leave Japan, I got a probably 15 Twitter's reminding
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   me to remember my camera.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   I know.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400]   So I, I'm sorry.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.800]   I was a little, I didn't want to interrupt.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   Go ahead.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.760]   I want to say something about three in the Nikon cool picks, 6000, but none till you're
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   done.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   No, that's it.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   That's all I had to say.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.880]   I had the LX3 and the, and the cool picks 6000 for a few weeks together.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.080]   And I did go with the, for my own personal camera, I did go with the cool pick 6000 because
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.120]   it's more comp, I feel it's more compact.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   It's easier for me to get it in and out of, out of a pocket.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.240]   It's all about the internet pants for Andy.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.040]   Well, if it can't fit in his internet pants, he doesn't want it.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.280]   Well, about the pants, babe.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   Don't forget.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.360]   It does, but it's also a lot easier.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.240]   I found it a lot easier to use.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.440]   I like the way that it's so absolutely customizable.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.800]   I can put whatever functions I want, plus behind whatever menu, whatever button I want.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.680]   I really, really though wish that I had that great lens.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.520]   Because I have a picture, I have a picture on my Flickr feed of backstage at the colonial
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.720]   theater in Boston, one of the most gorgeous theaters where you just, you can, you're
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.040]   distracted by how beautiful the actual house is.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.400]   You can barely pay attention to what's on the stage.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.920]   I was backstage, just took the elks through out of my pocket, took one snapshot from the
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.440]   stage of the interior of the house.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.120]   And it's probably one of the most gorgeous shots I've ever taken.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.320]   If I had my Nikon D80 with me, it would have been a tripod thing.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.880]   It would have been a wide angle lens thing.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.840]   It can't really compete with that incredible Leica lens.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.000]   But the entire package, I think, is for what I want a pocket camera to be, again, an answer
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.760]   to any photographic problem that's in front of me.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.200]   It's the P6000.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.480]   It does do time lapse, full scale.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.720]   It does do the, it'll actually do two different versions.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   It'll do time lapse down to one frame every 30 seconds at full resolution.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.880]   Or it'll even just build you a quick time frame by frame by frame, however you want.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.840]   As a matter of fact, during a train ride from my house to New York City, actually not just
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.560]   to Penn Station, but Penn Station, then leaving Penn Station, walking to the village for a
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   meeting.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.120]   I just basically had my camera suction cup to the window of the train taking a picture
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.920]   every 30 seconds, and then just built it as a stop motion movie.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.720]   And we'll go down to like, you know, do one a second or one every five seconds if you
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720]   want.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.840]   Unfortunately, 30 seconds is the is the is the th readiest.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.000]   That's the bad part of it.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.320]   But also it has built in GPS, which works as well as any onboard GPS can work.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.560]   And that is another one of those little features that says, you know what, if I if I'm in
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.160]   a great picture taken mood, I'll have the SLR with me.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.080]   I'm glad that both cameras are out there because I think that of all the people who are in
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.680]   the business out there, the shopping for a $400 pocket camera or $350 pocket camera,
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.600]   I think that your needs are best served by either the P6000 or the Alex three.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.280]   Like I said, it was really hard for me to send that Panasonic back because the caliber
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.040]   of pictures you can take with that lens are just like.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.880]   Well, and the wide angle is really nice.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.360]   I'm like, I have $400.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.680]   I'll make another $400 really quickly too.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.440]   I can own both of them.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   Well, I didn't mention the Mark two, which I took to France with me.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.520]   And I have to say, I've been super happy with that.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.760]   That is just a stunning camera.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.320]   The low light capability is excellent.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.960]   I know Alex, you were a little unhappy with the movie.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.000]   Well, then what I'm going to do is I think you could set the app and a chip and play
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.360]   with your camera play with mine.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   You could play with mine.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   All right.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.840]   I'm really I'm on this fence.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:08.600]   I'm still stuck between that and the D 700 and really the movie capability.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.440]   It would just be able to have a really good movie capability for cool interviews and stuff
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.560]   like that is really the thing that's kind of taking that we're returning this into a
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   Twitter photo.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.200]   I don't want to do that because it's a well, it's a great podcast and you should listen
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   to it.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.280]   But if you go to smug mug, you'll see my images from France.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.920]   You also see some test pictures I took in Petaluma and a full quality.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:34.400]   It's mung like let's you upload the full quick time 1080p movie that I took and just, you
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.040]   know, I'm not having any of the issues.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.360]   People are reporting with the black dots.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.480]   I'm not having any of the rubber stuff.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.560]   Of course, I put it on a tripod and I don't pan.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   I'm just very happy with it.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.880]   I think it's a spectacular camera.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:50.360]   But anyway, that's neither here nor there because you should really listen to this week
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.120]   in photography, if you care, to a photo dot com.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.800]   That's Scott and Alex's weekly journey into the world of cameras, which we seem to do
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800]   here on this show a lot.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   I guess we're all photo bugs.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.200]   That's just the way it is.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   Most Mac users are very heavy photographers.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.400]   Well, and for a while we were talking about nothing but video.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.640]   Remember the SD5 era?
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.240]   So it just comes and goes.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.960]   It just comes and goes.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.800]   And we talked about the iPhone a little bit, I think, when it first came out.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   Just every once in a while.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.160]   It might be wrong on that.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.760]   Can I say, I want to say one thing about the iPhone.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.680]   I know just one little thing that Google Maps on the iPhone is the reason to own the iPhone
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.160]   as far as I can.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.920]   It is, I was in Japan and it would tell me it doesn't work yet here for all everything
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.360]   in San Francisco, but I was in Japan and I could be anywhere in Tokyo.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.160]   Click on where I am.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.480]   Type in Rapungee, which is where I was staying.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.280]   And it would show me what train to take.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.640]   And the train actually, now it wasn't in English, so I had to kind of get used to the
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   symbols.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.480]   But the point was, is that that it wasn't that it was just driving directions.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.160]   It would give me the train directions in Tokyo and it was just unbelievable.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.920]   And that was the one thing that started pushing my wife towards wanting to have an iPhone.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.920]   Finally.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.920]   I'm in France all the time.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.920]   Oh my gosh.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.520]   I literally would not like I almost walked out without it.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.320]   And the only reason I went back for my iPhone because I couldn't really use it to make phone
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.080]   calls in Japan without paying, you know, dollar 50 a minute.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.280]   Well, I just forgot to activate mine and I called and activated it from France and I
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.280]   was so glad I did.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.280]   I had a guy on there.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.200]   I was able to find restaurants in Paris.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.360]   It was just really a nice thing to have.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   It was just key.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.680]   And the Google Maps is just, it's the best thing on the iPhone.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   So anyway, I agree.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.000]   Well, it's been a great show guys.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.200]   We made, you made me feel right back at home, right back in the saddle, reminded everybody
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.480]   next week we will be live for Mac world Expo.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:49.920]   So live live live Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, please come to booth 32 36
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.640]   in the left far back of the North Hall.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.160]   It's not a bad, richy rally team will be there.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.240]   So they got to grasp the new, juicy, the new Chevy.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.160]   You know, 40 by 40 inch booth.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.640]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.160]   What's your truck man is?
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160]   Oh, sorry.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.560]   That's a big policy image.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.360]   Watch Scott board and his night revealed funny car as he circles the 40 by 40 booth.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.120]   Hey, Adam was to the original.

[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.800]   And I think this will be a learning experience for all of us.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.160]   I'll be doing a feature presentation on Thursday nine a.m. at Mac world Expo.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:46.280]   And of course, all these guys will be performing nightly as, as, as somebody once said, tip

[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.520]   And he does a lot.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.800]   He's a very good, very good place to go because I'm, you know, I have ADD and I just throw
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.360]   it all up there.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360]   And I do too.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.360]   I know what you mean.
