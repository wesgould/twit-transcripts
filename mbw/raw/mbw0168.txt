[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all things
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.440]   appful, including, of course, the Macintosh, the iPhone,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.720]   the iPod, X-serve.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.960]   Did they cancel the X-serve?
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.280]   I think they canceled the X-serve.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.840]   Is it over?
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.240]   I don't know.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.400]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.120]   The X-serve.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.760]   They better not.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.640]   X-rayed.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.320]   X-rayed, they canceled.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.720]   That was a long time ago.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey, he's the kind of guy
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.320]   you'd walk up to in a store and say,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.160]   did they cancel the X-serve, the X-rayed?
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.520]   And then he would look at you and go, I've got to--
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.440]   I don't believe so.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   No, no.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.440]   It was the X-rayed.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   They canceled the X-rayed.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.480]   They now use promise reads.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.280]   From, really, these promise?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.720]   Or they usually when you're building a big X-an solution.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.920]   Did you see the sign upstairs?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.560]   Did you hear the sign upstairs?
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240]   I have not gone up this.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.960]   This sounds like a toilet flushing 24/7.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   They're pretty loud.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   Also, here, Mr. Andy Ihenatko.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.240]   Did I get the-- right?
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.440]   If we were in Portugal, that would be absolutely spot on.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.760]   From the Chicago Sun-times.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   We're a little punchy, because this is the Thanksgiving
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.520]   edition.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.480]   We're having a good time.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800]   We're all worried about that 22-pounder we've
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200]   got brining on the front porch, wondering,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640]   do the squirrels get it again?
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   Ah, I hate it when that happens.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.480]   Keep shooing him off.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.080]   I've got a fishing rod with a bobber on the end of it.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.280]   So I just go, this is--
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.840]   I've been working on a little security camera
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.200]   that you can pan and tilt.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   Squirrel cam.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   But I'm working on putting a laser on it.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.680]   Just fried squirrel go good with turkey.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   I don't want to hurt him.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.720]   I just want to scare him.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.560]   They don't need all that fur.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.400]   Yeah, you know, a little bit.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.240]   It's not that cold out here.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.320]   I'll sit down here.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   So we were talking about turkey before we began,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.000]   and I understand you are going to be deep fat frying,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.640]   Mr. Lindsey.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.760]   I might actually shoot it, too, with my 5D, just for fun.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.480]   You can see me run around on fire.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.040]   Man.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.920]   You know, that's the--
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   No, I'm going to build a hoist.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.000]   I've been watching Alton Brown.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.440]   What do you mean a hoist?
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.520]   So I'm going to build a--
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   That's a great show.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   So I'm not--
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   So I'm not that excited about sitting over top of hot oil
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.760]   when I put the turkey in.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.160]   So I'm going to put something there
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.680]   so that I can be holding a little line,
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.280]   and then the turkey can be--
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.640]   I can lower the turkey into the vat
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.920]   without standing over top of it, just in case I miscalculate
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.200]   the heat or the amount of oil, and it turns into a fiery inferno.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.880]   You have seen the YouTube videos.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.400]   I saw all the Alton Brown ones.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.480]   I've been studying them.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.000]   I've been preparing.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   I saw the one where you've not been underwriter in.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.720]   Underwriter's lab video of when things go wrong.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.440]   When things go-- what not to do with a turkey fryer?
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.080]   Because that's a-- basically, you've got that oil there.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.920]   Basically, it's combustible, and you've heated that up
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.360]   to a very high temperature.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.120]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.360]   Here's what happens when Underwriter's lab takes a turkey.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.040]   Looks like our partially frozen turkey is ready.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.760]   Partially frozen.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   That's the key.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.960]   Is that good or that bad?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.720]   Do not do that.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   The temperature's at 350 degrees, so I'll put the turkey in.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.480]   See, I'm not going to do either.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.760]   OK, watch carefully degrees.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Notice they've got a firefighter wearing a gas mask.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.440]   Right, and I don't have the Alton Browns to take.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.560]   See the part me standing there?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   That's not going to happen.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.200]   Yeah, move well away.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   OK, he's taking the lid off.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.920]   Who's he standing on?
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.560]   He's dropping the turkey in.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   Oh.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.640]   Oh, and then the overcoat.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.760]   Oh, oh, oh, oh my god.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.640]   The humanity.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.000]   Oh!
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.640]   Oh my god, that's awesome.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.480]   I'm absolutely going to try that.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.280]   And when that happens--
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   That looks awesome.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   Yeah, that is awesome.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.480]   You got to try this.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.600]   It'll be nice and crisp.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.960]   Are some of our questions concerns with Deeppad turkey
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.520]   fryers.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.120]   Is there lack of stability?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.600]   Watch how easy it is to tip it over.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.640]   Oh my god!
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.560]   That hurts.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.760]   Only two words for you.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.280]   Burn.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   Burn.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   So this public service brought to you by the folks
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.680]   at Mac Break Weekly.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.800]   I'm properly fine.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.320]   It.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.080]   I'm properly brined.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.160]   So the mistake they made was to put it in frozen.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   You don't want to have it frozen at all.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.800]   You don't want to have it wet.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   You don't want to have it--
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.760]   Because it will spatter.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.040]   Right.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.440]   And then you also don't want to overfill.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.080]   You want to start at 250.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   You want to pre-calculate how much oil is in it
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.800]   by pouring water in to make sure that it's just right.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.240]   And then you want to make sure it's only
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.720]   about 250 degrees when you actually stick it in,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.880]   then you can heat it up.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.600]   You don't start with it that time.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.040]   I don't think you really want it like--
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.960]   Well, this is the--
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.120]   Oh, that would be kind of fun.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.280]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.560]   No, no, I'll say this is a good topic for one of your science
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.120]   podcasts, because part of the problem
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   is that the liquid flashes instantly
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.960]   the steam, which is a expensive image source.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.560]   It's not simply that it spatters, then causes problems.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.280]   Apparently, it's a very complicated dynamic of which
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   makes me wonder why people don't know that Boston
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   Market will sell you a completely
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.480]   post-bird with three sides on only 90 minutes notice.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.680]   But I'm doing it for the experience of it.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.480]   You know, it's kind of like--
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   For the video, again, you've got
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   those red cameras.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.720]   I'm sure you've got high speed going.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.400]   I would be so disappointed if it doesn't look like Godzilla
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.440]   is being fought by a flaming, frozen, deep-fried turkey.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.520]   You know, and you know I would do it
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   if my wife wasn't watching.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.200]   But she's going to want it to be controlled and not on fire
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.680]   and everything else.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.880]   There's a guy-- we had him on one of the TV shows.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.000]   This would be a great job.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.160]   Who makes fire films for movies?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.960]   He does it in the dark and his backyard.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.600]   He'll burn things and he'll use a high-speed film camera
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.120]   to record this and then sells his stock footage to movies
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.600]   where it becomes part of the explosion.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   Is this VCE or ArtBeads?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.440]   Somebody like that.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   I mean, what an interesting job.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.840]   That's all he does.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.480]   He and his son blow things up.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.520]   I think that's VCE.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.920]   I have all their discs.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.840]   And then it's just flame that it's disembodied
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.200]   because it's a dark and you just use it as a plate, right?
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.480]   We used to do that at ILM.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.840]   You'd hear this.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.960]   You'd hear over the entire--
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.120]   Fire in the hole!
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.280]   No, no, it would be loud bang on Windward Stage.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.480]   It's huge.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.920]   Sometimes they--
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.240]   I don't want to work there.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.520]   They had a-- it was pretty good.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   They set off car alarms one time, like blocks around.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.160]   They got a little too excited.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.440]   They were afraid that they only had one shot at it.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.520]   I think it was the windmill from van Helsing,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.920]   and they put a little too much explosives in it.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.600]   And it was--
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.560]   Loud bang on--
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.280]   The gunward three.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   Yeah, I'm going to get Colleen--
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.920]   We got to get Colleen.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.880]   We got to hook up some--
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.440]   First of all, a building wide intercom.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.280]   And then--
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.680]   Well, I'll just say things every one.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.800]   Loud bang on Windlion.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.360]   Loud bang.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.080]   Back left studio.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.240]   Let's get to some Mac stories.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   Hey, here's an interesting Mac story.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.680]   IBM says, "End the line for the cell processor."
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.320]   Now, I'm going to-- I'm bringing this up because once again,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.720]   I like to castigate myself.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.240]   I like to flagellate by myself.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.360]   I like to beat myself up for mistakes made in the past.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.320]   And I was the one who said, when Apple announced
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.600]   there was going to go to Intel, I said, don't go to Intel.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.320]   Look at this-- the future of PowerPC,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.440]   this cell processor from IBM.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   It's multi-core.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.680]   It's got-- you know, it's-- this thing
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.160]   is killer.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.200]   This is what they put in the PlayStation 3.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.120]   IBM's VP of deep computing says--
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   David Turic says, "The cell processor
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.280]   has reached the end of the line."
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.160]   And while heterogeneous multi-processors, of which the cell
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.400]   was the first-- are here to stay, but IBM is not
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.840]   going to make any more cells.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.560]   Now, the question is, is would IBM have made more cells
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.320]   if--
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   Had Apple chosen them?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.440]   Well, they got them in the PlayStation 3.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.280]   That's true.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.040]   It's a pretty good deal.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.400]   And I presume there will be a PlayStation 4,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.320]   but I don't think it'll have a cell in it.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   No, probably not.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.480]   That might have been why they stopped.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.600]   No big demand.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.320]   I think that's it.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.120]   In fact, ours Technica says that IBM's decision
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.240]   to call it quits confirms suspicions
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.600]   that the cell's overall commercial success has been limited.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.480]   And maybe more to the point, there
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.240]   will be a number of cheaper, higher performance, more
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.160]   widely supported alternatives, probably
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.560]   from Intel, right?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:37.880]   Right.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.680]   I mean, I think that one of the big things
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.600]   is to see how--
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.920]   I think the more interesting processor conversation
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.480]   is really GPU versus CPU.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.600]   Well, and Laraby, which is the Intel combination of GPU,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.080]   CPU, multiple x86 cores on the same die.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.720]   I mean, that's--
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.220]   Right.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.240]   That's where we're going.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.400]   Because when we look at-- especially graphics processing,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.320]   we have-- some of our apps are very GPU driven.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.480]   And when you get used to a GPU driven app,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.880]   there are some limitations to it.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.040]   But when you compare it to a CPU doing the same thing,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.280]   you feel like you're watching the paint dry.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.160]   You know what the CPU--
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.400]   the GPU processing now is--
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.320]   I'm becoming a fan.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   I'm becoming a fan.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.640]   And the new 10.1 flash that they're beta testing right now
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.600]   is GPU accelerated, which is a huge relief.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.400]   Because as you probably noticed,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.320]   anybody's run a CPU measurement utilities nose.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.440]   It's 100% CPU utilization sometimes when you're watching us,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.960]   for instance.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.160]   And that's not so hot.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.720]   You really don't want that.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   No.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   But right now, I guess Apple is having a little trouble
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.560]   with their own CPUs with the iMac.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   What's happening?
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   So I guess these new i7 iMacs--
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Oh, the one I bought.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.720]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   --are starting to--
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   --are starting to--
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.320]   --the one I bought.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.640]   Did it come out OK?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.440]   Did it joke OK?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.040]   It's running.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.920]   Oh, that's good.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.280]   Because the ones that are--
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.560]   they're talking about are that they're showing up without--
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.840]   Oh, they're dead on arrival?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.360]   DOA.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.920]   Because the processor's not working?
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.960]   Processors, there's crack screens.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.560]   There's just some--
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.880]   It seems like it's more than just a handful of them.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   I bought one--
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   --it's being reported by Engadget.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.440]   Didn't even keep it.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:12.920]   I keep it?
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.800]   It's a donation to my kids' school.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.000]   I built them a podcast studio as a charitable deduction.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.520]   Wow.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.040]   Nice.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.960]   And gave them SM58 mics.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.440]   Those are cheap.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.080]   100 bucks.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.560]   Absolutely.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.600]   We got eight mics because I want them to be able to do music.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.360]   Very nice Mackey Onyx.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.440]   The 1620-- the new 1620 i has Fireware built in.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.320]   Wasn't the one that you just had laying around?
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.440]   No.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.960]   You got to know them.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.600]   I got them a brand new one because it's the new one.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.040]   And it's cool.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.540]   Exactly.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:38.540]   Exactly.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.960]   And it's beautiful.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.600]   And then-- it's so simple to do a recording studio these days.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.000]   Mike's mixer.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.800]   And the Onyx is less than 1,000 bucks for Firewire 16 channel.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.880]   Beautiful mixer.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.520]   And then they need a computer to record to.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.720]   I got them Logic Express.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.280]   I don't think I needed the full Logic Logic.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.920]   I don't think I needed--
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.000]   I don't think for podcasting, I think Logic Express is fun.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.240]   Or for even recording music.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.960]   It's the MIDI stuff and the special effects that you lose out of it.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.080]   We have one copy of Logic that we do any kind of heavy lifting
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.880]   that we want.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.480]   But the rest of it's all Logic Express.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.000]   I meant to ask you before I bought this.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.640]   That's what we're doing.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.360]   OK.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.840]   And then the iMac 27 iMac because the librarian at the school
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.560]   has done his own recording.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.200]   He's a musician.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.920]   He's done his own CDs.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.160]   And he says it's been his experience with multi-track--
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.800]   many tracks.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.960]   He can really bog a system down.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.240]   So I got the i7 with eight gigs of RAM
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   so that you'd have plenty of horsepower to run.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.740]   Sure.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.600]   Yeah, eight tracks simultaneously.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.720]   But I did test it.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.680]   I wanted to play with it.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.240]   Got the magic mouse.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.480]   What do you think of the magic mouse?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.120]   Let me tell you about the i27.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.620]   OK, OK.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.040]   The i7.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.960]   And then I'll tell you what I think about this thing.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   It's not going to be good.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.320]   No, it's not going to be good.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.840]   The beautiful-- I mean, the thing is almost too big.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.600]   The screen is massive.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.240]   Have I talked about this on the show before?
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.640]   I can't remember.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.560]   It's pretty much the same width as the 30, isn't it?
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.240]   So it's the same width as the 16 line.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.640]   Yeah, the 16 line.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.560]   So it's really wide.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.280]   But it's a little shorter.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.120]   That's just what you want.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.780]   You want 6.9.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.340]   I don't think you need the 30, which is almost--
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.420]   So it's just almost square by 1080?
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.380]   Is that the resolution when you set it?
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   It's higher than that.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.640]   Yes.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.100]   But it's the same, that same.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.460]   It's 16.9 and full 1080p easy.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.580]   The i7 in there, that's hyper threaded, 4 cores, hyper
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:17.860]   threaded.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.300]   So it's 8 threads.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.220]   It's beautiful.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.900]   I've been really thinking about getting that as a monitor
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.180]   for my Mac Pro.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.260]   So I could render to my monitor.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.460]   I know.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.980]   You know, it's funny, though.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.540]   Comes with a little beady keyboard.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.100]   Oh, no.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.480]   They've cut off the extension.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.500]   If you look at your Mac keyboard, the Thinlul aluminum
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.180]   ones, it's got a number pad.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.900]   And then it's got the home button and up and down.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.020]   And the arrow keys, all of that is now built in just this top
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.580]   part.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.820]   And it's Bluetooth.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.060]   So it's a little teat--
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.660]   the thing is monster.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.300]   Comes with a little beady keyboard in the middle mouse.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.020]   So it's got a strange experience.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.780]   But yeah, I have to say, it felt fast, felt good.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.440]   And it ran.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.020]   So I didn't realize I was at risk.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.060]   It's good I tested it before.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.940]   Evidently, evidently, there's been a higher than normal failure
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.100]   rate coming out.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.700]   But I'm sure that it's just one of those things.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.980]   Early manufacturing.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.500]   There seem to be two different issues
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.660]   that people are tracking.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.540]   Number one is just the idea of the packaging is not sufficient.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.340]   It's just getting broken during kinds of--
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.180]   It was so big.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.980]   I'm not surprised.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.180]   It's not even a subtle thing.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.340]   It's like you take it out of the box and, oh,
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.420]   there is a decorative crack in the middle of the screen.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:24.920]   Wow.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.180]   What a realistic looking decal.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.060]   I'll just pull that right off.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.020]   No, that's actually a crack screen.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.740]   And in some of these multi-core processors,
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.260]   there's some ideas that they're failing at rates that
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.660]   are considered unacceptable for a machine that
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.620]   costs more than $30.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.700]   Well, I guess I was lucky.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.940]   But I have to say, I do recommend it
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.180]   if you have money to spend.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.620]   Because it's not as bad as you would--
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.940]   Like $2,200, $3,300 on a Mac Pro.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.620]   And it is an absolutely gorgeous machine.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.620]   So pretty.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.540]   You loved it.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.820]   After you spend a certain amount of money for a machine,
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.780]   you want to plug it in for the first time
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.220]   and immediately forget about what you spent for it.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.820]   And the quality of this display, the quality of the experience
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.180]   is so way up there on this one.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.700]   I can't remember another iMac.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.060]   That just made me think, there is a machine
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.060]   you do not spend $599 for it best by.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.500]   Right.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.060]   And I really think we're looking at a TV with--
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.060]   when you put a Visa mount in it, when you have inputs,
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.980]   the thing that would have really put it over the top
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.740]   is if it had an HDMI in.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.460]   That would be the--
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.500]   Well, it has this.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.260]   It's a deep-- the mini display port in, right?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.740]   It does.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.540]   But it would be hard to get from HDMI to that mini display.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.020]   Oh, it is.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.540]   I thought that was pretty--
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.060]   I think you go from mini display to HDMI.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.460]   I don't think you could go--
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.140]   But not the other one.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.540]   I think the other way is more difficult.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.060]   But I will say that if you're looking at iTunes,
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.900]   if you're looking at streaming via iTunes,
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.940]   if you're looking at--
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.300]   iTunes going after the Roku, for instance,
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.180]   you're looking at taking in stock of all the things
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.500]   that Apple learned doing Apple TV,
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.300]   and then just incorporating it into the TV.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.940]   And I think that that's going to be a big piece of what
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.300]   Apple is working on as they try to go into the living room.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.100]   I wouldn't be surprised to see a 42-inch iMac.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.100]   For what?
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.100]   I mean, it would have been better.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.180]   I mean, it would have packed it well.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.620]   42 inches.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.500]   No, but it's like it's your home TV.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.420]   And it also has a wireless keyboard.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.100]   And you can--
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.180]   Well, that's exactly what Jason said a year ago.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.500]   Jason Calacanis said this was his big rumor
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.540]   that there was going to be a 42-inch basically TV set sold
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.020]   by Apple.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.500]   That makes sense.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.340]   Make it an iMac.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.980]   That's one of the things I was thinking about when I saw
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.260]   that display port and found out how difficult it would be
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.620]   to use the iMac screen as a dedicated monitor
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.020]   for something else.
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.980]   I have no trouble imagining--
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.540]   underscore the word imagining--
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.380]   Apple using that display port in the same way
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.620]   that they use the dock connector,
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.420]   that the license out to certain video manufacturers
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.380]   and certain home theater manufacturers,
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.140]   the ability to manufacture a box that will work over Bluetooth
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.620]   or work wirelessly that could get to that screen directly
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.140]   for highest quality 1080i output,
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.020]   but also be essentially an appliance for the iMac.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.220]   Well, I think that when you're looking at--
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.500]   when I'm looking at my house as being
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.340]   able to have my Drobo hooked up to my Mac Mini somewhere off
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.940]   in the corner.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.300]   But I have my iMac hanging from the wall in my office.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.220]   And I'm able to access my entire library of movies and music
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.020]   and everything else from there.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.060]   And it's just a whole different experience.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.220]   I think that that's the-- for me, and especially as you look
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.180]   at things like YouTube, now releasing a 1080p streaming
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:38.700]   service.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.300]   So as YouTube does 1080p, now I want to have that on something
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:43.660]   like that.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.820]   And I need a computer to do it.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.620]   We're so rapidly moving to this convergence that took so long
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.060]   to get here.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.260]   And it's now going to happen overnight, practically.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.660]   You were just about to say the word Roku, Andy.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.460]   There's a good example.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.620]   Put that kind of capability, which I think the Yahoo widgets
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.780]   are close, right?
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.540]   They're close.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.180]   I mean, we're on Roku now, by the way.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.060]   In fact, some of you might be watching this
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.620]   on your big screen TV on your Roku.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:05.980]   Love that.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.580]   That launched yesterday.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.140]   I saw it.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.660]   Yeah, very exciting.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.100]   Does anyone need to do anything with a Roku to update it
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.940]   or just let you do?
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.020]   Yeah, you do.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.060]   You'll see a firmware update available to you.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.940]   And then you just run through the firmware update.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.540]   And then you should have access to this new Roku
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.500]   application store.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.260]   And we're in it.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.140]   Revision 3 is in it.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   Mediafly is in it.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.820]   If you can get any video podcasts,
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.940]   if you get the Mediafly application.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.780]   But we're launching with Macbreak Weekly this week in tech,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.020]   this week in fun, this week in Google, and Windows Weekly,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.060]   the first five shows.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.100]   But then all of our shows will be there eventually.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.900]   And for those who say, well, what about iTunes?
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.660]   What about my Apple TV?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.660]   Yes, of course, we're going to do iTunes versions as well.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.300]   Right.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.340]   In fact, at the same time, there is a--
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.900]   I think-- well, I'll have to look into this.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.820]   I no longer know everything about my business.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.500]   I used to.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.060]   Well done.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.580]   Well done.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.060]   Well done.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.020]   You know what you're doing?
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.260]   You're doing the right thing where you know what's going on.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.220]   But it's my understanding that there are people.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.500]   There are people doing this right now as we speak.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:05.780]   Hey.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.300]   I predict that ideally you're only 13 months away
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.060]   from your major communication with your staff being stellar.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.100]   I pay you people to screen these calls.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.260]   I already said that.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.900]   I said that this morning.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.340]   All right.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.220]   Said if you can't do it, I'll find somebody who can.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.340]   I've been dying to say that.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.380]   We're going to take a break and come back.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.900]   The good news, of course, if you're 27 comes DOA,
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.460]   Apple is really good about instant replacements.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.740]   I saw somebody on Twitter saying,
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.420]   I called Apple Care yesterday to say,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.140]   my keyboard's dead, got a new one this morning.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.060]   And that's pretty common.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.620]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.420]   And I'm sure that they're responding very quickly to this.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.860]   Unless you've been smoking.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.380]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.980]   But right now, I want to mention our friends
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.940]   at Citrix who do that great product, go to meeting.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.940]   If you go to go to meeting.com/macbreak,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.700]   right now you can sign up for 30 days free.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.580]   I don't have to tell you, Alex, you travel all the time.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.300]   That's not cheap.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.260]   It's expensive.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.580]   And if you're going just for meetings,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.940]   you have to go because you have to bring cameras.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.500]   You have to shoot.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.820]   But if you're going just for meetings,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.060]   we sat day in New York over the weekend.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.340]   And I just got the bill.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.900]   I said, you got me replaced?
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.820]   No, I didn't say that.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.900]   I said, next time, let's do go to meeting.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.140]   Go to meeting, let's do more, save more, and travel less.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.060]   And you're just going to have a lot more conversations
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.500]   when you do it.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.420]   I think that's the other thing.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.260]   You use it more.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.660]   And you meet more than you would otherwise.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:28.980]   Exactly.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.420]   And being able to show your screen, share your screen
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.380]   makes a huge difference in a lot of the meetings
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.180]   that you thought you had to go to.
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.220]   And now you can simply have everybody log on.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.540]   It's just far more efficient.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.300]   It's not just-- you just do it more often.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.500]   Right.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.620]   Let me give you a free trial.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.780]   And this is the easiest way to test it.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.620]   Try it right now.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.140]   Get it while we're talking.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.660]   You can install it.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.500]   It's that easy.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.220]   Mac or Windows, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.380]   You'll have it installed in a couple of minutes.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.100]   This will cost you nothing.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.820]   You've got unlimited meetings for a month.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.940]   Then it's $49 a month for unlimited meetings,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.340]   as long as you want, as often as you want,
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.660]   including voiceover, the internet, and free teleconferencing.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.020]   It's all built in.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.100]   Please do me a favor.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.940]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.420]   Give it a try today.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.940]   One of our chatters is mentioning--
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.140]   and I should have made this clear--
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.300]   GPU acceleration for Flash 10.1 is only available on Windows.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   They didn't put it on the Macintosh.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   I really think that there is a collision coming between Apple
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   and Apple.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   Absolutely.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.820]   That is a shot across the bat.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.860]   That's a way of saying-- I mean, look it.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.580]   They're Intel chips, ATI and NVIDIA graphics processors.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.460]   There's no reason in the world.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.900]   They say Apple didn't give us the information we need.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.300]   It's like a--
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.220]   Well, I think that there's-- yeah, I really
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.580]   think that there's an issue.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.500]   I think that Adobe-- if they're not
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.180]   worried about the fact that the iPhone and any future stuff
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.740]   isn't supporting Flash, they should be.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.580]   And I think that also there is a risk for Adobe
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.100]   related to their Pro Apps.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.620]   And I think that Apple could--
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.540]   There's always been that rumor that Apple has its Photoshop
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.940]   in the lab.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.380]   I think-- I can't imagine that they wouldn't.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.660]   I don't think that the problem is
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.820]   that releasing something like that would cause a lot of trouble.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.540]   So I think that you want to have it there.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.540]   But I think that the other thing is, I think that Photoshop--
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.780]   Ryan Shroud, who does our PC show, says it's Apple.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.620]   It's not Adobe.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.340]   He says there's no reason Adobe--
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.980]   Ryan is being a little naive, I think.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.300]   There's no reason Adobe wouldn't want Flash to be
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.060]   accelerated on the Mac.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.340]   Apple's just not giving you the information.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.860]   I think you might be underestimating Ryan the animosity
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.260]   between these two companies because Apple never
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.180]   did allow Flash on the iPhone.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.260]   Apple's clearly-- they've always had an edgy relationship.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.580]   Because Apple needs Adobe for now.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.820]   And remember what happened--
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.700]   I mean, a lot of this is also coming from the fact
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.140]   that a long time ago, when things were really cozy,
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.180]   Apple didn't have Final Cut Pro Studio.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.980]   Apple didn't have--
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.180]   Because there was Adobe Premiere.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.980]   And the minute Adobe pulled Premiere from the Mac--
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.100]   Well, it wasn't Premiere.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.940]   It was Avid.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.460]   So--
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.020]   Avid, okay.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.820]   When Avid announced--
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.420]   Apple was really interested in trying to--
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.340]   I mean, this is the rumor, I don't know for sure.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.580]   But that Apple was really trying to get someone
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.620]   to base an editing package on QuickTime.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.340]   And so Final Cut-- they picked a Final Cut from Macromedia,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.820]   actually.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.300]   And they were working on it.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.260]   And it really-- what I had heard when Apple released it
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.540]   is it was like a little editing app.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.620]   It wasn't really designed to be this what it's become.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.100]   But when Avid announced that they were going to let go
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.140]   of the Mac platform, Apple, their focus changed a little bit.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.460]   I think the way you told it last time was Steve Jobs
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.660]   came storming into the room saying, how can we screw it?
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.660]   I don't remember.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.260]   I do not remember saying that.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.740]   And he's not saying it in public.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.460]   I don't-- I cannot get perfect.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.260]   Why wasn't there?
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.180]   What is it?
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.420]   What is it we could do?
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.940]   Oh, I know.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.540]   I mean, look it.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.180]   There is a rumor that it would--
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.540]   that there were people in Apple or high up
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.260]   that were fairly--
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.260]   Insensed.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.260]   Perturbed.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.780]   Perturbed.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.220]   It was not-- it was not probably one of the better ideas
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.700]   that Avid had.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.380]   Because it really created a--
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.180]   what I know as a result was where I worked, everybody--
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.140]   all the editors got Macs and we were--
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.500]   Final Cut.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.540]   And they were asked, you know, like, what do we need to add?
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.260]   And it was very funny.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.700]   Frankly, I mean, Avid's still around,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.420]   but it's not the powerhouse it was.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.300]   No, I mean, Final Cut has become--
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.780]   and I think that the--
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.660]   I feel like Apple hasn't pressed the Final Cut studio
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.620]   the way it was getting pressed in the earlier days.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.980]   I think part partially because the product is somewhat mature.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.780]   But it has really become the fact-o editor
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.020]   for many, many people.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.060]   I mean, when you hear someone's doing an Avid,
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.300]   you kind of feel like they're going-- you're like, hmm.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.540]   Or if they're using Premiere, you just
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.660]   assume they're on a PC.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.620]   You know, you don't-- on a Mac, it's--
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.020]   Final Cut has become kind of the fact-o.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.420]   So a great-- a great series of comments
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.740]   in the IT blog watch, Richie Jennings'
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.500]   column in Computer World, in which he synopsizes
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.100]   the various blogs talking about Apple care and smoking.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.940]   Starts with Cade Metz, who says, "A Mac user claims Apple
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.740]   voided her warranty and refused to repair her machine
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.060]   because it was, quote, contaminated with cigarette
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.560]   smoke.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.340]   An Apple service center had agreed to repair the machine
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.220]   before telling the owner repairs were not possible
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.060]   because the system contained some sort of smoke residue.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.500]   And apparently, there's one other person
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.380]   complaining the same thing.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.620]   Laura Northrop responds, you know, smoking isn't good for you.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.380]   It's not good for your computer either."
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.420]   And then somebody who responds on slash.says,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.940]   I used to work as a computer technician.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.540]   And I've seen this too, by the way.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.340]   Computers that had either failed or seized up
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.660]   due to nicotine and tar build up were nearly impossible
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.540]   to clean or repair.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.420]   And I have seen the inside of a computer
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.740]   with a heavy-- where a heavy smoker used it.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.140]   Mass.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.060]   It's pretty bad.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.980]   David Corsi says, "I'm as much against smoking as anyone.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.780]   I also don't want workers to needlessly
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.140]   expose to hazardous substances.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.300]   Still, for Apple to deny warranty claims on Macs,
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.700]   exposed to cigarette smoke seems way over the line."
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.780]   When you think about all the junk that's
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.420]   used to prepare those circuit boards to do the assembly
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.860]   manufacture, all the car's sentigens,
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.540]   they are technically on a certain list of things
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.020]   that will cause your nose to fall off.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.020]   And to say that this thing was in the house
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.420]   of someone who was smoking.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.820]   I don't know.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.820]   Well, actually, although let's have one little caveat.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.260]   If it's someone who is a smoker and plays Warcraft,
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.500]   I'll side with that.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.740]   Because you know that they've been spending 10 hours a day
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.020]   doing nothing but staring dull yet that screen puffing
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.940]   smoke into the inner--
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.780]   But I don't want to look inside that.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.180]   Gotta go fishing.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.500]   But here's the question is, is that would we consider
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.340]   that a problem if someone was in a very smoky environment
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.340]   and the computer--
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.700]   I mean, I think most of us would assume
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.020]   that you don't have to cover warranty
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.100]   if someone spilled water on it.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.460]   But if someone was in a very smoky environment,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.020]   not a cigarette smoke--
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.620]   I've seen a computer that was in a fire,
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.100]   wasn't damaged by the fire, but is useless because the smoke
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.340]   from the fire ruined it.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.860]   Right.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.180]   Or if you're in an environment that has a lot of particulate
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.660]   in the air, I don't know if Apple would necessarily say that--
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.660]   regardless of whether it's a smoker or not.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.100]   If there's a lot of particulate in the air
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.980]   and it's filling it up, I wouldn't expect Apple to cover that.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:42.620]   I guess I--
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.420]   FTW says in our chat room that the Apple has far more weed
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.700]   smokers than PCs.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.340]   What about that?
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.300]   I don't think weed really produces much smoke.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.620]   Weed smoker residue.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.460]   I don't know.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.780]   Have you been using your Mac as a bong?
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.660]   Oh, we just like to answer.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.020]   Just one question before you authorize this warrant coverage.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   Have you ever really looked at your fingers?
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.980]   I mean, really looked at your fingers.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.060]   And if they don't say, oh, what the hell you're talking about,
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.180]   then you know they're a weed smoker.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.420]   But the thing that makes this into a--
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.180]   what the hell story is that they're not saying that--
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.900]   they're not saying that you damage your computer
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.620]   by blowing too much cigarette smoke in there.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.660]   They're not even saying that--
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.380]   they're not even saying that you have no idea
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.660]   how bad your computer smells because of all the computer
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.500]   smoke.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.820]   It'll funk up the entire back room for as long as we have it
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.460]   and for that reason we'd rather not have it.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.140]   They're saying that it represents a health hazard
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.020]   to our IT workers and as such.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.540]   We're not going to force our workers
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.060]   to expose themselves needlessly to workplace whatever
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.140]   whatever.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.980]   And that's not a reason.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.060]   That's double speak.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.820]   I think this--
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.820]   unfortunately, it's two people.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.940]   You don't know-- it's hard to validate that this really happened.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.740]   I find this hard to believe that Apple would actually--
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.180]   Say it.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.500]   Say this.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.860]   They might think it.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.340]   They might send it back and say we can't fix it.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:05.980]   They can't fix it.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.420]   But there's no way they're going to avoid warranty
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.420]   because you smoke too much.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:09.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.340]   That's just not possible.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.460]   It's possible.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.460]   Not probably.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   You're the guy who drinks a venti, triple venti, quad, mocha
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.900]   with a twist, Californian.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.500]   I used to.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.580]   I gave that up.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.300]   And smoke, we don't smoke.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.020]   I know smoking.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.940]   If I spilled my venti on the computer,
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.020]   I would not expect Apple to fix it.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.820]   No, that's a good point.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.620]   It doesn't explicitly say in the warranty.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.340]   We void this warranty for heavy coffee pouring in the computer.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.860]   But I think that there are rumors that the new laptops do
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.620]   have something in the board that if it gets wet,
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.460]   it changes color.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.460]   I know many cell phones-- probably
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.900]   been there.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.540]   All cell phones do that.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.700]   Because people would--
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.860]   They'd bend over.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.860]   Their cell phone falls in the toilet.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.060]   And then they say, oh, they dry it out.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.780]   And they say, I don't know.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.140]   By the way, just an update.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.380]   I talked about my iPhone that went into the--
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.060]   I'm twittered about my iPhone that went into the wash.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.300]   Full cycle.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:03.940]   Full cycle.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.820]   Full cycle.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.860]   Spin dry?
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.260]   I did not put it in the dryer.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.660]   I pulled it when I was putting stuff into the dryer.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.900]   There's this big clunk when I was like,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.860]   can I leave in my pocket?
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.740]   And I was like, aah.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.020]   But didn't it?
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.580]   It went through a spin cycle, though, in the washer.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:13.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.820]   Well, full spin cycle in the wash.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.580]   That's heavy geez.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.180]   OK, so it was submerged for 25 minutes.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.180]   Rinsed, re-rinsed.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.060]   It was a hot-- it was a warm cycle.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.180]   And it was right before I went to Brazil.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.060]   I just bought a new phone.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.580]   I was like, I can't have it not working.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:28.980]   You know what I'm in?
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.740]   Brazil.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.900]   And I gave it to Tony, who's at the office.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.780]   And he put it in a bag of rice.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.740]   And he's now using it.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.740]   Oh, Tony's smart.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.260]   That was good.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.580]   That was going to be it.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.180]   I once did it.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.420]   As a matter of fact, if you search YouTube for some logical
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.220]   keywords you'll probably see, I did a segment on a column
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.540]   and then a segment on the CBS Morning Show
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.100]   about testing urban legends on how
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.220]   to salvage laundered or wet cell phones.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.340]   And the number one best thing is if you have a cat,
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.500]   you get the kitty litter.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.700]   That's the fresh--
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.860]   crystals, not the clay, but the crystals.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.660]   OK.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.620]   Because it's 100% pure silica gel.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.740]   It's designed to do nothing but absorb moisture.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.300]   Get a sealed Tupperware container.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.540]   Put the wet phone inside there with the crystals.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.980]   Seal it up so that sucking all the moisture out of the phone
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   and not the environment.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.220]   And after a day, you have a very good shot
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.460]   of it being perfectly good.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.460]   If you don't have that handy, then definitely
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.140]   use the rice because the rice does the same thing.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.060]   It'll just absorb water like anything.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.060]   The only modification I ever made to that conclusion
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.500]   was somebody told me that--
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.740]   I'm surprised he didn't say before you even
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.860]   tried that--
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.580]   put the drapery nozzle of your vacuum cleaner against it
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.180]   and just hold it against any open port on that thing
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.500]   for a good minute or two to just to get the majority,
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.700]   the moisture out there.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   It's salvageable, unfortunately, because of those color-changing
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.260]   dots, that's a better course of action than saying,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.700]   I don't know, it just stopped working.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.700]   Right.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.980]   Can you use those packets from the hard drive?
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.620]   Did you say that?
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.140]   Can you use those--
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   Yeah, enough of them.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.420]   Those silica gel things.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.740]   Or is that not enough?
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.540]   By the time you get enough of those packets together,
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.620]   that's how much time it would take you to go to the supermarket
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.660]   by the back of those crystals.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.580]   Like, kitty litter.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.100]   I'm serious.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.580]   It's like $6 for enough of a bag that you could rescue yourself.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   But what do you do with the clay?
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.780]   Is it include clay?
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.540]   Or is it like this is a separate fresh step?
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.540]   It's not--
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.300]   It's a special type that they use.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.660]   It's nothing but silica crystals.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.700]   There's no clay, no nothing.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.580]   It's like beautiful little crystals of white and blue
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.980]   and green majesty that you think, congratulations, crystals.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.460]   You were going to be soaked in cat urine.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.820]   Now you're going to be simply soaked in laundered water.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.260]   They must be very happy about that.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.100]   Happy crystals.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.100]   Whatever, whatever.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.380]   They had no reason to hope, but they were in the lottery.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:46.740]   All right, my magic mouse review, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.820]   Look at when I move my finger, when I move, you move.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.940]   When I move, you move.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.380]   Here, you play with it.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.340]   So it's--
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.100]   How do I ask?
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.100]   As with all--
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.740]   Apple has a--
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.340]   Oh, you can't.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.380]   You have to bond it.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.860]   First of all, here's something that's a little surprising.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.700]   First down has ever happened to me with an Apple product.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.260]   You have to download a driver.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.340]   Right, download a driver?
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.020]   You have to download a driver.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.860]   You have to download the magic mouse driver.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.460]   All right, all right.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.140]   And then it's Bluetooth.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.860]   So you have to attach, bond, say hello.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.140]   I believe it's Bluetooth.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:22.500]   Is it?
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.300]   Yeah, it's Bluetooth.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.340]   And then it's funny.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.180]   Apple has just like this love-hate relationship with mice.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.500]   It has the same problem that the mighty mouse has, which
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.980]   is that in order to right click, you
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.180]   have to lift your left finger.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.100]   Because it's not mechanical.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.980]   It's got mechanical click, but it's the whole thing clicks.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.140]   I have to say, feel that in your hand.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.740]   Is that feel comfortable?
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.580]   It's not a comfortable mouse.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.340]   It doesn't have the curves that even a cheap mouse.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.300]   I don't even know if this has--
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   I don't even mean this.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   I just wouldn't use it.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   You could tell.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.580]   It would drive me crazy.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.700]   It's a little bit of a soap bar.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.420]   Now, you're moving my mouse.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.780]   Now, go ahead.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.260]   Just move my mouse.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.020]   You're moving my mouse.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.900]   Here, you can look at it over there.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.700]   If you stroke the top of it, just lovingly with your finger,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.220]   that scrolls.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.260]   And that's not so bad, although we have scroll wheels on--
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.660]   I have to admit, that is the one thing
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.900]   that I do use a lot on my trackpad is this.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.100]   If you swipe to side to side, it scrolls sideways.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.860]   And you could do like browse through things.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.140]   Yeah, you're browsing through stuff.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.780]   I'll tell you what I'm surprised.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.580]   It doesn't have pinch.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   That's what I was trying to pinch it over.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.940]   It doesn't have pinch.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.580]   It doesn't have rotate.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.700]   It only has a few gestures.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.940]   I'll show you the gestures it has.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.700]   Give me back my mouse.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.620]   You can go to the control panel and get--
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.820]   because once you've installed the new magic mouse software--
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.700]   now, I hear silence from Baston.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.740]   So that tells me that Baston might have another opinion.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.260]   So here it is.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.340]   You've got the right click.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.460]   Hey, the little video's--
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.580]   Yeah, well, this is the new system preference
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.100]   made for all my-- see, there's this scroll.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.660]   I hope that's a woman's finger.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.740]   Because I'm kind of thinking how hot she is.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.300]   And if it's a guy, I'm going to really peel back.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.620]   I'll bet you those videos were really expensive too.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.060]   Did I go too far?
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.380]   No, no.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.140]   I just imagined, again, Alex with all of his resources
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.060]   and tools, saying, you know what?
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.780]   That's a woman hand doing things that
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.100]   are interesting to an object.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.900]   I wonder if it would be funny if she would have
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.580]   put different objects.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.380]   Oh, let's not do that, Alex.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:25.900]   You could, though.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.260]   Somebody will, no doubt, a mashup.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.260]   A system preference mashup.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.500]   So you've got--
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:31.980]   Oh, baby.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.740]   Swipe me, baby.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.380]   Swipe me.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.980]   The screen zoom is the same thing as you've always had,
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.780]   which is scroll with the control held down.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.340]   And then the only gesture really that's--
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:44.340]   is this two swipe left right navigate thing with two fingers.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.900]   It's surprised.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.700]   If it was more rounded, I'd be more interested.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.740]   If it was more ergonomic.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.700]   But there's not.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.180]   It's not comfy.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.980]   Now, notice there's a mass battery level here is 91%.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.180]   It's got two batteries in it.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.700]   I think they're double or triple A. Let me look.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.220]   No, they're double A batteries in it.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.620]   And I still have scongyly on it because the way it was packed,
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.340]   they had a sticker on it, which left behind residue
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.140]   on the bottom of the mouse, which I really find surprising
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.460]   from Apple.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.220]   So two very non-Apple-y things in here.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.820]   One, the packaging leaves goo on my mouse.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.940]   And two, you have to download a driver.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.620]   What do they think they are?
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.820]   Microsoft?
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.820]   So anyway, it's not bad.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.340]   It's better than the Mighty Mouse was.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.020]   It's much better than the iMac mouse was.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.060]   But Apple still seems, for some reason,
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.660]   as all for all their brilliant industrial design--
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.140]   Why are they obsessed with trying to make the next great thing?
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.540]   And they just haven't quite figured it out.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.780]   It's funny that they can't lick the mouse.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.340]   They've done so many great design.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.900]   For instance, try to get this battery lid back on for me.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.820]   Because it is-- OK, Andy, obviously,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.980]   you've played with it by now.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.900]   Believe it or not, I have not played with it outside.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.500]   I'm just visiting the Apple store.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.140]   I haven't gotten around to calling my people at Apple
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.260]   and saying, can I have a--
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.620]   I didn't want to spend $65 on it.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.060]   Apple sent me a note saying, would you
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.060]   like to try the magic mouse?
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.780]   And now they wish they hadn't.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   That's fine.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.420]   I point you toward these previous episodes of the Mac
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.460]   Break Weekly, which I've said that anything that's not
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.180]   a very, very simple two-button Microsoft
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.820]   mouse I'm probably not going to like.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.740]   Based on that, and not only that I occasionally
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.500]   get the eyeballs of 5 million people on the course of a month,
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.660]   please send me product in order to take a look at it.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.340]   I didn't ask them.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.180]   They just offered it.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.780]   And I said, well, all right, go ahead.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.540]   Because I knew I wasn't going to like it.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.300]   And I couldn't bring myself to spend $65.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.260]   But I guess what I should do now is pack it up and send it back.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.660]   Now having tried it.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.820]   It's not a dead pan.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.460]   It's not like this thing is horrible,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.460]   which is what I said about the Mighty Mouse.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.260]   I think for some people, you might like it.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.540]   I mean, certainly beautiful on the desktop with a 27 inch.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.340]   And clearly, that's Apple's kind of what they care about,
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.380]   is how it looks amazing.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.340]   I don't mind the Mighty Mouse now that I've used it a lot,
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.500]   except that I turn off all the stuff on the side.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.100]   That little ball, I'm sorry.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.980]   This scroll wheel is so much better than a little ball.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.620]   I kind of like going back and forth, though.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.540]   I use the back and forth.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:09.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.540]   Well, you can do that with Logitech's anywhere mouse.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.660]   You can tilt the scroll wheel left right, and it doesn't.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.860]   I like the back and forth.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.780]   I just don't want to really hate about the Mighty Mouse.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.500]   It's the two little side ones that turn exposé
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.500]   on whenever the first thing I do.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.220]   Every time.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.180]   I just go up there.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.900]   Let's ignore those.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.100]   I just pretend those don't.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.260]   Now, by the way, having--
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.260]   You got the lid back on.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:29.940]   Thank you.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.780]   Was that hard to do?
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.780]   No.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.220]   Well, it's good we got a second opinion, because it was easy.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.260]   It literally took me like 20 minutes the first time.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.020]   No, no.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.260]   And then I just had you do it this second.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:42.860]   I just topped it right on.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.180]   I'm never taking it off again.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.460]   And by the way, it's now lost.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.820]   For some reason, it lost the mouse.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.620]   I don't know why.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.420]   It's on.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.340]   So let me turn it off and turn it on.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:54.740]   There it is.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.180]   I found it.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.460]   OK.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.500]   So I had to turn it off and on.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.980]   I'm not crazy about Bluetooth either.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   I like to stick with Wired.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.500]   I just don't like it constantly telling me.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.100]   You're out of range.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.100]   You're out of range.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.600]   Right.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.900]   Or batteries die.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.700]   It's really bad for on-air.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.740]   That's where I learned my hatred of wireless
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.020]   is at the beginning in screensavers,
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.980]   we had all wireless because we didn't want to have all those
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.500]   wires around.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.380]   In the middle of a show, we're doing a live show.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.140]   The keyboard dies.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.140]   That's great.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.740]   Live.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.340]   Live.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.820]   I mean, that's not a good-- so I just said,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.980]   can we have Wired for now on?
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.660]   Let's not-- well, it found the mouse,
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.820]   but now it's still searching.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.300]   See that?
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.460]   This is why I don't like wireless.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.260]   Why is it searching?
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:32.820]   It's right here.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.380]   It's right next to you.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.420]   Look!
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.620]   Look!
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.700]   Put it in front of the camera.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.540]   There you go.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.460]   Take a picture.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.620]   Make sure they're looking at each other.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.060]   Make sure they're looking at each other.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:44.540]   What do you do?
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.500]   So it's searching.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.460]   And I'm not the only one surely who takes the mouse
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.220]   and waves it around, hoping it will see it.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.180]   I am?
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:54.660]   The only one?
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.620]   Yeah, the only one.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.900]   I usually just-- I go back to work
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.740]   and just come back like 10 minutes later.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.660]   I think that's what I should do.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.380]   It's bound it.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.260]   Locking.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.700]   It says found, but now it still says searching.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.780]   Can you just hit continue?
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.620]   Still lucky I have another mouse connected.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.580]   [SINGING]
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   Turning.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.100]   It's not searching anymore.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.820]   It's now connecting.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.820]   Connecting.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.300]   This is why-- OK.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.020]   Enough said.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.740]   How about those new Apple ads?
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.500]   What new Apple ads?
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.060]   Oh, the ones about AT&T?
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.460]   Defending AT&T's coverage map?
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:27.740]   Oh, good.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.140]   It's back.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.900]   I can now go to the new Apple ads.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.900]   Thank you.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:37.140]   Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.380]   It's somewhere in there.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.900]   Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.540]   All right.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.180]   Where are the new Apple ads?
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.500]   They're on the list.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.220]   They're on the list.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.180]   OK, let me click.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.340]   You know, this is what happens when your mouse goes down.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.460]   You're kind of--
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.100]   We can talk about Sci-Stari while we're
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.500]   waiting for that click to come up.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.860]   We can talk about that last week.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.740]   Yeah, we did.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.420]   Didn't we?
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.220]   See, I get confused because I talked about it on the--
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.420]   We were talking about it.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.980]   The court case, they lost big time.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   Anything else to say?
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.340]   Did they go out of business?
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.140]   No.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:05.660]   What did they do?
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660]   OK, I'm sorry.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.140]   OK.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.900]   Are they all done now?
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.100]   Did they say they fought to survive?
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.140]   Someone on Twitter, I read me that, told me
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.820]   that we hadn't talked about the Sci-Stari decision last week.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.620]   And I couldn't remember having talked about it.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.700]   Well, it could be that my problem is I do too many shows.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.660]   I know I've talked about it.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.220]   It could be the reason that this isn't exactly Diet Coke
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.620]   inside, hiding inside this mug.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.860]   It's a different can entirely.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.580]   And perhaps I should stop laying off
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   this Daddy's Little Medicine before show time.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.700]   Starting next week, this week--
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.500]   I've already opened this.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.100]   Too late now, my days were to drink it.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.300]   Would be ashamed to waste it.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.180]   What Leo to see you.
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.940]   So I'll hide you inside my tummy.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.620]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.300]   I do want to talk a little bit about the App Store
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.900]   Paul Graham, who I think is really brilliant, wrote an essay
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:57.780]   about how badly broken the App Store approval process is.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.100]   He says he calls it Apple's Mistake.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.660]   And I'd like to run it by you.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.740]   I think Paul's really good.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.460]   Have you read any of Paul Graham's stuff?
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:05.960]   Yes.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.020]   He's brilliant.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.060]   He's a guy who wrote the plan for spam that
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.020]   suggested Bayesian anti-spam filtering, which
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.780]   has been a single best way to fight spam ever since.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.020]   He's written a number of really good books, hackers
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.060]   and painters is brilliant.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:33.140]   He started the venture angel funding company called--
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.220]   they do that.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.580]   Hacker News, what's the name of it?
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.380]   Ah, well, it'll come to me.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.180]   Anyway, we'll talk about what Paul Graham said in his blog,
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.220]   paulgram.com.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.580]   And just a little bit--
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.820]   I need to turn on the secondary click.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.180]   We'll also talk about Roga Miba.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.380]   And what they're saying about the App Store process.
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.060]   But right now, I would like to mention our friends at Ford.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.500]   Have you driven the car?
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.260]   I haven't driven the car.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.740]   I've got to put you in the car.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   I've got to put you in there.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.100]   I'm going to have to--
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.580]   Devorek took it on Sunday.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   We're doing a commercial.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.740]   You're doing a commercial.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.660]   I'm doing a commercial.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.780]   Justice, let me grab the car.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.540]   So I give him the key.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.180]   And he went up and down the street.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.260]   I really liked it.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.580]   But we're not doing an ad for the car.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.740]   We're doing an ad for what's in the car, which is Ford Sync.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.260]   The hands-free calling music search,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.860]   turn-by-turn navigation available exclusively.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.540]   And I know a number of people said, well,
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.380]   can I get a third party?
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.380]   No, you've got to get a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury vehicle.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.940]   Sorry.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.300]   But you can find out more about it by going to Sync.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.260]   S-Y-N-C, MyRide podcast.com.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.780]   Have you changed the picture in there?
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.820]   Yeah, you put the Twit.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   I put the Twit logo in there.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.460]   So cool.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.020]   It's so cool that you put a logo--
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.220]   your own logo on the video screen in a car.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.340]   Isn't that nice?
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.260]   That's not in all Ford Sync vehicles.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.220]   I have Sync Plus.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.700]   I got the GPS electronics package.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.940]   This is the beauty of Ford Sync.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.020]   You don't have to spend the extra money on the--
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.740]   I shouldn't say this.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:57.500]   Ford might not like it.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.620]   But you don't have to buy that big screen.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.300]   With Ford Sync, you've got turn-by-turn directions,
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.300]   even without the screen.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   Now, it has an LED screen.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.860]   But the turn-by-turn talks you through it.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.860]   So you say, you press the button on the steering wheel.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.340]   You never take your eyes off the road.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.580]   This is kind of what I like about it.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.340]   You never take your hands off the steering wheel.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:14.860]   You would press it.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.980]   You say, navigation, directions home.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.500]   And it will talk you home.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.340]   You don't need the screen.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.700]   I want the map.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.060]   You're just old-fashioned that way.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.380]   You just want to know my mind's mostly like, navigation,
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.500]   get me out of here.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:27.780]   It is.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.140]   It's just like that.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.420]   Back roads, back roads.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:30.940]   That's what I--
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.860]   Oh, it'll do that, by the way.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.900]   You can tell you, remember this route, remember this route.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.140]   And then it will tell you what the traffic is,
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.700]   and it'll reroute you.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.220]   It's got weather forecasts, traffic, sports scores,
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.020]   it updates all this stuff.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.620]   I think, based on Microsoft technology,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.260]   I bet it's the Microsoft Spot stuff.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.700]   I'm not sure, but I bet it is.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.620]   You know that spot watch that they were doing for a while?
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.780]   So it's wireless data's coming in there.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.660]   Calls 911 if the airbags are deployed.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.780]   I mean, this thing is amazing.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.140]   I want you to take a look at it online.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.540]   That would have been useful.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.020]   Have you ever had your airbags deployed?
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.580]   I saw someone in here in Padawim,
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.940]   I was helping someone with their airbags.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.540]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.380]   That's hit.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.180]   It's hitting.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.580]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.940]   Everyone was OK.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.300]   Man, well, so OK, so I don't want that to happen.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.420]   But as soon as I get in the car,
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.020]   I think you can have 25 different phones.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.380]   I've got both my Droid and my Apple phone.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.380]   My iPhone are both immediately connected to Bluetooth.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.660]   If the airbag should deploy, it makes a 911 call.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.140]   It plays a recorded message saying airbags have been deployed.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.940]   We're going to send you GPS coordinates.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.580]   Takes the GPS coordinates from the iPhone.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.140]   Sends that to 911.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.700]   It's the regional 911, by the way.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.180]   So you're going directly to a local 911.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.540]   Sends them the coordinates.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.260]   And then, by the way, you can override this if you're fine.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.580]   But then it gives you voice control.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.460]   And the 911 dispatcher can say, are you all right?
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:49.940]   Right.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.340]   And here, if you're there.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:51.860]   Right.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.260]   And if not, then you're lucky you have this 911.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.980]   There's vehicle health reports.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.260]   You'd love the vehicle health reports.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.620]   It'll send them to you every--
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.300]   I haven't said every 5,000 miles to send me
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.060]   a vehicle health report.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.100]   I just love this.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.900]   I am a big fan.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.540]   I just want-- I want control over the air fuel mixture.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.260]   We can arrange that.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.900]   I'm not with sync, though.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.340]   Watch it goes.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.780]   Sync My Ride podcast.com right now.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.420]   Take a look.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.060]   You could see some of the features of the Ford Sync.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.820]   But you can also tweet to win.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.020]   They're giving away 15 iPods and Zooms
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.020]   between now and December 8.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.820]   All you have to do is put pound Sync My Ride podcast
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.260]   in a tweet.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.620]   You might tweet something like Alex, Andy, and Leo
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.860]   are off the hook in Mac Break Weekly this week.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.020]   Pound Sync My Ride podcast.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.700]   And then that way, you'd be in the drawing.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.900]   And one a day from now through December 8.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.980]   And I know we have had several winners who are listeners,
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.140]   because they've sent me an email.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.340]   So I want it to be you next.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.220]   Sync My Ride podcast.com.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.420]   We thank Ford so much for their support
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.660]   of all of the Twitch shows.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.220]   It was a little Christmas present from Fullard.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.060]   But I didn't get a deal on the car.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.220]   No, he paid retail.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.180]   I tried to get a deal.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.820]   I was saying I didn't try.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.940]   I said, you got a friends and family anything?
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.220]   They said, well, we'll get back to you.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.140]   And I said, I just need it now.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.620]   I want to try it before I talk about it.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.020]   And I'm glad I did.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.260]   So what were we going to talk about before the break?
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.100]   Ads.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.180]   Ads, the new ads.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.540]   The new Apple Ads.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.020]   Are they on Apple's website?
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.340]   If I go to apple.com?
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.220]   They were on the CNET.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:26.140]   If you go through the Apple Droid commercial,
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:26.980]   I see it right here.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.860]   Let me just find this.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.060]   Best Droid commercial ever?
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.980]   No, new Droid commercial.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.660]   Horizon Droid.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.060]   Apple Ads to Verizon.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.220]   Can Droid do this?
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.340]   Ah.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.660]   So they're kind of like the--
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.580]   we've got an app for that in reverse, right?
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.420]   OK.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.140]   I hate to put an ad before the ad.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.180]   That's ridiculous.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.620]   OK, here we go.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.220]   This is the iPhone ad.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.500]   Did you see my email?
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.260]   It's called.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.980]   Say you're on a call with a client.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.500]   And he asks, did you see my email?
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.100]   You can say, yep, got it right here.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.180]   Or if you're chatting with a buddy and he says,
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.980]   hey, can you change that reservation?
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.540]   You can say, sure.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.780]   Or you're talking to your wife who says,
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.980]   I can't believe our anniversary is a week away.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.540]   Can I do that on my Droid?
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.380]   Me neither.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.420]   I don't like it the same time.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.620]   All without ever leaving the call.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.620]   Is it a difference?
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.700]   Can your phone and your network do that?
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.660]   Oh, I see.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.060]   You're saying on the Verizon network,
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.060]   I can't do data while I'm on a phone call.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.500]   I think you can't do both at the same time.
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.980]   I think you're right.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.260]   Which is an incredibly useful part of the iPhone
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.060]   that I didn't--
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.060]   But that's not the iPhone.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.980]   I was scared to walk away.
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.100]   That's AT&T's network as opposed to--
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.260]   that's the way AT&T does it.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:38.900]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.300]   Do you know?
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.340]   I had to double check that because I know that you can't
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.220]   take a phone call within certain Droid apps.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.500]   That's one of the things that Google is very, very proud of
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.900]   with their Google Maps navigation application,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.380]   that you can take phone calls without having
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.180]   to dump from the navigation.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.460]   Alex, do you have your phone here?
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.820]   Can I call you?
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.380]   I'm going to call Alex.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.260]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.100]   I don't have your phone number.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.460]   How can I not have your phone number?
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.140]   Oh, I know why because you don't answer your phone ever.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.820]   You say, don't talk to me.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.660]   Email me.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.160]   All right.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.600]   Now I'm going to call the office number.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.800]   Give it up.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   Here.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.120]   Let me call the office number.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.160]   We're just calling here.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.000]   It's going to be your phone.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.840]   No, it's OK.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   I got it.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.840]   I got it.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.960]   You know our office number is--
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.560]   and some twit.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.960]   Did you know that?
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.520]   OK.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.760]   So now I'm calling the office.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.560]   Let me put it on the speakerphone.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.040]   Depends on who answers the phone.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:29.540]   Hey!
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.920]   Look at what I did there.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.640]   Hi, Frederick.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.680]   This is Leo.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.240]   We're just doing a test on the show.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.800]   Is that OK?
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.560]   This is Leo.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:40.920]   It's me.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.080]   I'm in here.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.600]   Oh, my god.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.080]   She said, who?
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.880]   Do I know you?
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.160]   OK.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.840]   Now I just want to--
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.800]   Did you just want to be on the show?
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.480]   I just want to see Frederick.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.880]   If I can now go to a data and look,
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.760]   let's look at my calendar.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.440]   Am I still on the phone with you, Frederick?
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.800]   I'm looking at my calendar.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.040]   How could that possibly be?
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.160]   Apple said I couldn't do this.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.680]   I already go to other apps.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.440]   What other apps?
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.680]   What other apps do you want me to go to?
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.200]   Pick an app.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:04.880]   Go to the web.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.800]   How about Google Maps?
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.600]   How about Google Maps?
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.120]   Are you still there?
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:09.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.320]   OK.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   I'm downloading my map.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.880]   Maybe that's just Google Maps.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.040]   So you're saying if I go browse, let's go browse.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.800]   Is still there, Frederick?
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.360]   Now I'm browsing right now.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.840]   I got Google on there.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.120]   And just to be safe, try a third-party app,
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.520]   because all the ones that were in Apple's demo
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.240]   were third-party app.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.600]   OK.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.800]   So third-party app.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.960]   Pandora.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.120]   That's a third-party app.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.080]   Well, that might be mute.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:31.560]   That's music.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.160]   That might be music.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:32.640]   Bright-kite.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:32.840]   OK.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   Let's see if I can do bright-kite.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.600]   Bright-kite.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.040]   It's going on on the internet.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   You're still there, Frederick?
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:37.720]   Hi.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.200]   I'm still here.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.480]   Yeah, she's still there.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.320]   Finding you.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.840]   Bright-kite.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.600]   Pick a place.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.720]   Let's go with it.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.840]   As far as I can tell, it's working.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.880]   So what was it they said?
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   Oh, check my email.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.520]   Oh, right.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.880]   They said you can't check your email.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.800]   Oh, let's check my email.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.840]   I'm checking my email.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.600]   This ad is full of it.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.000]   Excuse me.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.520]   Well, what network are you on?
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.160]   I'm on Verizon's network.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.280]   Did you turn off Wi-Fi?
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.080]   Oh!
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.960]   You think I'm on Wi-Fi, eh?
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.600]   Maybe it's using the Wi-Fi network for data,
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.840]   and it's using the voice network for voice.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.040]   I didn't think of that.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.800]   I can't tell if I'm on Wi-Fi.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.480]   Because everyone has icons on the roof.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:22.920]   Let's see.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.840]   Let's turn off.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.520]   Only icons are on the top there.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.840]   You know what I'm saying, don't you?
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.680]   On the roof?
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.480]   I like that.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.880]   I've got 20 icons on the roof.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.960]   That's a problem I have with it.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.480]   It's on my roof.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.360]   So one thing to say is that--
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.600]   OK, I've turned off Wi-Fi.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.560]   I'm going to turn off Bluetooth just to be safe.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.080]   You still there, Frederic?
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:38.560]   I'm still there.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.840]   Poor Frederic.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.360]   It's OK.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.680]   I think one of the other things I've done--
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.480]   To notice is that Apple doesn't mention the droids.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.000]   What's that?
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.600]   Yeah, they're getting-- this is called Fudge Words.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.400]   OK, I'm still surfing.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.720]   Let's see.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   Let's go look at Google-- oh!
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.160]   Up, up, no network connection.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   Browser cannot load this page.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.280]   You were right, Andy.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.640]   Thank you.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.280]   But that's a few Fudge Words Apple probably should add.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.440]   Well, they're not comparing to anything.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.200]   They're just saying--
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.000]   They didn't say anything, yeah.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:04.600]   No, you're right.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.120]   I cannot-- OK, so that's what it was.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.840]   I was on Wi-Fi.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.560]   So I can't use the 3G network while I'm on a phone call.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.680]   Thank you, Frederic.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.360]   OK, I don't know how to hang up now.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.120]   So that's the--
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.320]   A situation.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.080]   Yeah, and actually, this is a well-known problem with EVDO.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:22.560]   Right.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.440]   Is that you can't do phone and data at the same time.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.200]   You have to choose.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.760]   OK.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.120]   So now we know that if you--
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.200]   so it should say--
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.600]   well, it doesn't ever mention anything.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.560]   It never mentions anything.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.160]   They're very clever.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.320]   They don't mention the--
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.440]   Otherwise, they have to be fine print that says, you know.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.680]   But they don't say anything.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.080]   They just say, can it do it?
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.920]   They inject--
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.240]   Can you do that on your phone?
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:48.600]   Can you?
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.080]   Can you?
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.480]   But I have to say, as somebody who uses a drawer,
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.880]   I didn't even know whether I could do that on my phone.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.960]   Right.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.680]   So I don't know how effective this ad is.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.880]   But I have to admit that I use that feature a lot on my iPhone.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.680]   Like, I would--
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.640]   It is a nice feature.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.400]   Really quickly on Android if I--
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.880]   No, no, no.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.360]   I'll give-- OK.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.160]   I'll give him that.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.640]   I'll give him that.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.240]   And it does-- and two other credit is, as a--
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.280]   I think it's better to have a standalone app--
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.520]   excuse me, standalone ad that simply says,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.160]   here is a feature that our phone has
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.960]   that we're very, very proud of as opposed to--
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.600]   no, no, don't look at the other one.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.800]   Pay no attention to the other one.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.240]   Pay attention to ours instead.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.280]   And I've always really liked the way that Apple handled
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.240]   phone calls in progress while you're doing something else.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.640]   The idea that you have that green bar at the top that you
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.520]   simply tap there to go back to focusing on the phone software.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.360]   OK.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.880]   So-- and as a couple of people who've
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.360]   said in our friend feed chat room,
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.800]   if that's a feature you need, the ability
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.960]   to access the internet while you're on a phone call,
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.480]   Apple's right.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.080]   That's a feature that Verizon cannot give you.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.760]   That's a Verizon feature, not an Android feature or a wax.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.680]   Which will be hard to--
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.680]   Which also makes it interesting to think about whether Apple
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.120]   would be interested in going to--
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.880]   especially if you run these ads-- whether Apple would
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.800]   be interested in a Verizon solution--
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.240]   until Verizon is a new network.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.920]   Hey, what happens--
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.960]   now here's a question.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.960]   What happens if I'm, say, streaming video on Twit Live,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.040]   which we can do on this Droid phone?
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.280]   I'm streaming our live video.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   You can't get--
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.560]   No phone calls can come in?
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.080]   No phone calls.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.720]   That's a bad thing.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.120]   So we can't interrupt it.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.480]   I don't think so.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.040]   But it is network specific, Andrew Smith, saying in Canada
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.160]   on the Rogers network, no problem.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.800]   Right.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.760]   So it's the EVDO.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.800]   It's EVDO.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.960]   It's a limitation of EVDO.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.680]   And so I wonder if you're using data,
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.480]   I believe your calls just go to voicemail, says Ken Shepperts,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.800]   and say, that is a negative.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.440]   OK.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:44.920]   OK.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.080]   I'll buy that.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.360]   They even though they don't mention Droid or Verizon--
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.080]   The uppercut lands.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.960]   The uppercut lands.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.800]   If you know it lands-- but see, that's the problem.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.720]   I think a lot of users don't know.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.520]   I didn't know.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.320]   I mean, I remember-- I didn't really remember reading that.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.120]   But it hadn't come up for me.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.480]   Apple managed to yank down Verizon's ponytail.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.720]   The references, they didn't get carded for it, so OK.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.280]   Apple gets a wedgie.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.320]   Hey, here's some news for the Kindle folks.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.480]   It's not strictly Apple news, but I think very good news.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.720]   Kindle firmware update is coming out.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.600]   Kind of an early Christmas present from Amazon,
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.880]   which will support PDFs natively.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.240]   This is for the standard Kindle.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.360]   The Kindle 2?
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.760]   Not the big DX?
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.080]   That was an important thing for them
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.560]   to do because Sony Reader already supports direct PDF.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.840]   I imagine that's going to have the same sort of solution
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:41.360]   that Sony does, which is to not try to reproduce the PDF
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.560]   exactly, but to simply display the content in a way that
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.360]   will fit onto that screen.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.440]   So that's definitely going to be a disadvantage compared
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.520]   to the Kindle DX, which can show the entire width of the page
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.040]   and just let you create it like electronic paper.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.240]   I'm also curious to see exactly how long
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.760]   it's going to take this new firmware update to process
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.520]   each page, because when I know of the processor that's
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.680]   inside the Kindle 2, it hasn't optimized or chosen
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:09.800]   to do that kind of math.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.520]   And there's a lot of math involved in rendering.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.080]   Interesting.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.720]   So there's a different processor in the DX.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.160]   It's smarter.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   It's faster.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.000]   One of the things that they were very proud of when
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.680]   they introduced it was that it's a faster--
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.360]   it's a faster book reader.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.040]   Doing searches and stuff like that will be a lot faster,
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.440]   though it's not a computer, so it's not designed
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.840]   to be a speed machine.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.600]   But it really does show you how competitive the book reader
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.520]   market is going to be in 2010.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.960]   There's going to be at least four different readers out there,
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.560]   each of which came to fight.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.040]   And it's going to be a great time for consumers.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.440]   If you want an ebook reader, for sure, you've got Kindle,
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.760]   you've got Sony, you've got the Barnes and Noble Nook.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.640]   What's the other one?
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.200]   There's Acer's coming out with one.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.960]   Acer's also coming out with one.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.600]   And Apple.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.720]   Who knows?
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.360]   It's fantastic because now there's
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.640]   no need for an iTunes store like Model,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.800]   because Adobe has already won the battle, so to speak,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.040]   to control who gets to sell books.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.840]   They came out with an open format called EPUB
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.120]   that everybody is getting behind, including Sony,
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.840]   including all these commercial factions.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:16.400]   Adobe has created a DRM that everybody else
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.560]   seems to be getting behind.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.400]   And also, one of the reasons why EPUB is such a great format
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.920]   is because it doesn't care what it contains.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.840]   It just wants to be a standardized container.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.920]   So Adobe was able to create a DRM that would fit inside EPUB
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.640]   so that it doesn't matter where you buy this book from.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.760]   So long as it supports this Adobe Digital Edition's DRM,
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.560]   it'll work just fine.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.280]   And there are multiple stores right now
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.640]   that support that format.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.520]   Also, the book publishers are smart enough
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.120]   to have learned from the mistakes that the record companies made
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.920]   when they made their deals with iTunes.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.200]   They do not want to help create that kind of a monster
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.960]   for publishing, where they have to negotiate
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.920]   with this one centralized iTunes-like publisher
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.240]   every time they want to control what they sell their books for.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.040]   So they are very much interested in making sure
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.760]   that if they have 100,000 titles in their personal,
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.600]   licenseable library, they want to make sure
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.160]   that they can sell that to Barnes & Noble,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.760]   they can sell that to Amazon, they can sell that to Apple,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.680]   and they can simply take money from whoever's willing
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.240]   to sell content through their store.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.960]   - One thing to be fair to Apple is,
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.400]   Apple did not, I don't think that any of us,
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.960]   Apple benefited from the fact that Fair Play was involved,
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.240]   but Apple did not want a DRM when they started.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.760]   That was the music industry's idea, it was a bad idea,
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.680]   and they paid a deep price for it 'cause they're idiots.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.520]   (laughs)
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.720]   - And the, but it was an Apple's idea to do that.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.320]   It was their idea to do that.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.880]   - That's absolutely true, but the publishers are responding
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.480]   to the situation that Apple accidentally created,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.640]   and the troubles that the record industry
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.120]   found themselves in by, that's their just rewards
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.800]   for not listening to Apple for so many years,
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.000]   but it really does show that that's their,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.200]   that's the publishing industry's desire to make sure
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.360]   that you can publish it once,
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.560]   sell up there as many venues as possible,
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.640]   and if you wanna raise your,
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.920]   if you wanna start paying absolute cover price
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.240]   for the latest hot, hot, hot book,
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.000]   they want the ability to do that and take the risks themselves.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.440]   - I was corrected by the chat room,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.360]   that says that the iPhone, if you're watching data,
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.680]   I'm not the iPhone, the Droid,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.960]   if you're watching data, will ring.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.480]   - Okay, but then it'll kick you off, whatever you're doing.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.880]   - And if you answer, it will kick you off.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.200]   So that's actually the right response, I think.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.400]   So that's good news.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.120]   Paul Graham, who now I remember, of course,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.000]   it's why Combinator or why Combinator is his,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.520]   is his kind of, I guess it's an incubator for startups.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.080]   Apple's mistake, this is on his blog,
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.320]   paulgram.com/apple.html.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.560]   I don't think Apple realizes how badly
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.680]   the App Store approval process is broken,
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.000]   or rather, and I think this is the main point,
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.640]   I don't think they realize how much it matters
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.320]   that it's broken.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.640]   The way the Apple runs the App Store
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.280]   has harmed their reputation with programmers
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.960]   more than anything else they've ever done.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.520]   Their reputation with programmers used to be great,
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.640]   it used to be the most common complaint you heard about Apple,
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.760]   was that their fans admired them,
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.480]   too uncritically the App Store has changed that.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.760]   Now, a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.200]   and a big defection from the iPhone,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.920]   ROGAMIBA, which is Apple's,
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.560]   I think one of Apple's best developers,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.880]   they do Audio Hyjack Pro,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.600]   they do Airfoil for the iPhone,
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.720]   which is a really slick program
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.560]   that allows you to listen to iTunes music
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.880]   on other devices.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   They're complaining because they said three months ago,
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.200]   we, Airfoil was approved on the App Store,
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.080]   three months ago we gave them a bug fix,
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.760]   it's three months later Apple still hasn't approved a bug fix,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.640]   and that's gotta be frustrating for developers.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.360]   It's one thing not to approve the app,
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.040]   but not to approve the bug fix.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.120]   >> I think the challenge is that Apple is,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.160]   when you try to have this much quality control
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.640]   or whatever they're working on,
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.280]   trying to make sure that everything's just gonna work
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.080]   just right, the issue that you get into
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.200]   is you become the bottleneck.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.840]   And I think the problem is beyond
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.960]   >> In a bottleneck at this point,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.800]   when you have three months for a well-known
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.600]   >> That's a bottleneck problem.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.000]   That's a bottleneck problem.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.880]   There's other problems that Apple has is,
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.720]   I mean, 'cause wait a minute,
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.880]   isn't that micromanaging me?
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.760]   Look, at 1.1, you know,
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.360]   how long does it take?
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.760]   Do you trust ROGAMIBA YADA?
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.000]   It is, I'm sure that it is strictly a case
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.520]   of way too many applications coming in for approval,
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.000]   and the fact that all of them have to go
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.120]   through the same pipe,
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.480]   and they have X number of people going through it.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.160]   I mean, I think that there's just a level of,
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.360]   well, they need to address this then.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.720]   >> Absolutely, I'm not saying that they shouldn't.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.600]   I'm saying that that's not a,
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.360]   I think that that's clearly a problem of bottlenecking.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.080]   >> Right, well that makes sense.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.680]   So if you address this, then it's how you do that.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.040]   >> The higher more people are what.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   >> But this is really starting to look like a problem
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.080]   that can only be solved by,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.000]   there's such a consistent and longstanding
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.600]   set of problems associated with relationship
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.720]   between developers and Apple,
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.200]   in terms of where the iPhone is concerned,
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.840]   that it's really starting to look like there is
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.560]   one person in charge at Apple who doesn't get it,
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.840]   will never get it, will never appreciate
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.880]   the scale of his problem,
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.200]   who might be starting policies that are impossible
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.240]   to implement or impractical for the solution,
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.400]   and this individual might need to find another place
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.040]   at the company, because if we're just a case of,
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.240]   well some things are being,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   are not being declined approval,
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   even though there's really no reason to do that,
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.160]   if that would be one thing.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.040]   If it takes six or seven to eight months
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.680]   for something to be approved, that's another thing.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.600]   But it's that, it's this other thing,
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.760]   it's this third thing.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.160]   There's a problem with,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.440]   there's an application called the O-tourist.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.040]   Okay, beside issue, developers,
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.520]   come up with a name that can be pronounced
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.360]   and easily spelled, A-U-T-U-U-R-E-I-S-T.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.600]   That's a lot of, anyway.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.240]   O-tourist, it's a writer's companion app.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.800]   I'm not saying anything about the app,
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.960]   I'm just, I can't pronounce it.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.480]   But supposedly, and this is a unique problem,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.040]   it got proved, very good,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.440]   it's available on the app store,
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.400]   excellent, excellent things are working fine,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.720]   but people buy it and then they cannot download it.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.560]   Okay, big problem, bigger problem is that the author,
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.240]   who now has a posterist blog,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.720]   talking about its problems with Apple,
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.360]   he's having a problem just getting Apple
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.800]   to respond to an email saying,
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.120]   "Hi, people are buying my app, but they can't download it.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.760]   "I've got a lot of people who are very angry with me."
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.080]   And when is the problem, where is there a fix?
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.600]   And when are you gonna actually respond to any of these emails?
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   I mean, this is one of those things totally concerns me,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.720]   that if as of November 2nd,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.640]   it's been, he says on this posterist blog,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.800]   it's day 19 and still no fix,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.480]   and he still hasn't heard back.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.800]   And if this is the sort of problem where
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.200]   it's not that there's a bottleneck,
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   it's not that there is an inefficient process
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.040]   that they were, "Hey, I'm sorry, we were unprepared
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.080]   "for the wonderful success of the App Store.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.360]   "If this is the problem, there's a consistent difficulty here
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.480]   "that Apple needs to make a very big,
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.240]   "serious, consistent fix for us."
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.080]   - The question is, and this actually is something
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.840]   that I think was, this point out actually in the IRC,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.960]   which I think is a really good point,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.320]   is have we ever seen an operating system
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.400]   that had 100,000 apps added to it in 16 months?
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.480]   - Yeah. - Ever.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.320]   Ever now.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.560]   And this is part of the problem.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.640]   I mean, this is the issue is that,
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   we've never, ever, ever seen any platform get hit this hard.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.400]   And part of it's because it's a popular outlet.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.960]   Another part of it is that making apps is easy,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.000]   for the iPhone much easier than a lot of other pieces.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.520]   And to go from zero to a thousand,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.120]   or a hundred thousand in this case,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.760]   in 16 months is a big jump.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.600]   And I think that they're--
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.160]   - You sounded like an apologist.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.480]   - You know, I just, I'm not willing to pile on.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.080]   I think that Apple needs to figure out
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.560]   how to fix the bottleneck.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.760]   But I don't necessarily think that that means opening
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.160]   the floodgates and letting everything in.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.600]   I think that there's another side of that,
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.800]   where we got a lot of crap that isn't working,
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.000]   that's breaking our phone, that makes it so that we can't call,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.280]   that makes it so we can't do a lot.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.520]   There's a lot of things that could happen
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.600]   if we just open up the floodgates,
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.000]   and I'm not open to that either.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.360]   - But let's acknowledge that it's very, very unusual
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.920]   for a company to say we will give you free pancakes
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.680]   to anybody who comes to the store.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.680]   If you say that though, you need to be able
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.640]   to deliver free pancakes, which is what you promised.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   If you do not have the ability,
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   then you should stop offering free pancakes.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.960]   That's, Apple had a choice of saying
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.560]   that we're gonna have a totally open app store,
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.400]   or are we not?
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   If we're not gonna have a totally open app store,
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.800]   what ever is hot totally open app store.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.960]   - They've never said it.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   - I'm saying they didn't.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.000]   I said that they have the, what I'm saying is that,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.160]   they have the ability to say we are not gonna be
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.560]   the gatekeepers of software.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.240]   We're going to take, they could have taken
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.600]   like an Android model, which is gonna say
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.080]   that we're going to have an official store,
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.800]   which will have approved content on it,
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.560]   but developers will still have the ability
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.240]   to make software downloads available
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.600]   directly through their sites.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.040]   That's not the decision that Apple made.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.640]   Apple assumed voluntarily the responsibility.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.480]   - Oh, I agree.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   And in the case of Oh, Tourist, I mean,
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.520]   Surge has written an application.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.120]   People have been charged for the application.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.080]   Apple says you can only download it from us,
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.600]   and they're not responding two plus weeks later
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.840]   when he says people aren't able to download it.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.000]   So now everybody's screwed, people who buy it,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.640]   and the guy who wrote it, and Apple's not responsible.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.360]   - I mean, I definitely think Apple has to massively
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.440]   beef up what they're doing,
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.280]   and streamline what they're doing.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.120]   - They need to man up and handle this now.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.960]   - I will agree with that.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.600]   - And well, let's go back to the original contention
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.760]   that Paul Graham makes, that this is damaging
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.640]   in a much more serious way than Apple seems to realize
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.800]   by alienating the most important people,
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.040]   the most important audience for Apple,
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.200]   which is independent software developers.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.120]   - Yeah, and also realize that all these other
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.440]   operating systems and phones, they're making improvements.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.200]   They're making some damn nice phones out there.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.640]   I don't think right now the monetary impetus
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.040]   is to develop software, is to abandon Apple.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.840]   If you want the Gold Rush, you wanna go
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.320]   to develop stuff for the iPhone,
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.040]   but that could change a year from now.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   That could change a minute.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.800]   - And exactly, so Apple needs to fix things right now,
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.160]   today, so that a year and a half from now,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.080]   when the next Google phone is as good as an iPhone
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:27.160]   in every way, that all these problems are no longer problems.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.960]   We used to, think of all the problems
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.440]   that Apple computers used to have three years ago,
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.840]   five years ago, 10 years ago,
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.520]   that now aren't just completely inoperative and irrelevant,
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.920]   and she only showed that the person making that argument
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.360]   just isn't very, very hip.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.640]   We want that to be the case a year and a half from now,
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.800]   saying, well, the approvals process,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800]   well, that was fixed like a year ago, right?
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.680]   - Right, right.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.040]   - Or should listen to the show?
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.280]   - Well, they absolutely have to dive into it.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.240]   I do think-- - There's gonna be a rebellion
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.000]   at WWDC if they haven't fixed it by then.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.560]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.960]   - The clock is ticking.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.440]   - Yeah, I mean, I think by then,
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.280]   they're gonna have to figure something out this minute
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.120]   to figure this thing out. - They're gonna move it.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.960]   - They have to clear it out,
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.720]   and that might mean tripling the number of people
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.960]   that are going through the process
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.840]   to make sure that nothing stupid is getting stopped.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.200]   You know, and then you can worry about how you deal
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.360]   with the areas that are a little more great.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.760]   - It underscores the problem with the kind of
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.520]   micromanagement Steve Jobs seems to prefer.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.160]   It inherently creates a bottleneck,
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.920]   whether it's Jobs himself or this App Store approval process.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.680]   This kind of dictatorial system is in the long run,
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.520]   doesn't scale.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.640]   - But I mean, as a software developer,
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.880]   (laughs)
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.160]   one of the things that we stopped developing
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.200]   one of our applications on Windows
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.200]   because it required too much customer support.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.280]   I mean, that's the bottom line, it was called a flexion.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.000]   We were getting 50% of our sales and 90% of our calls.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.640]   We're coming from Windows, we just stopped making it.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.480]   'Cause it was just, and the reason that we were able to,
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.400]   the reason we kept on developing on a Mac was because
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.560]   there were very few people,
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.880]   because we only had to test it on a certain number of systems
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.760]   and we knew it would work.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.480]   This open ended piece meant that we would theoretically
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.120]   need 27 or 28 machines with different operating systems
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.840]   and different setups and everything else
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.560]   to try to figure out whether our app was actually,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.760]   'cause our app was a little on the edge of,
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.920]   you know, using a lot of what the computer can do.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.160]   And that just wasn't reasonable.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.360]   And so the thing is that that control
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.880]   has obviously its drawbacks, but it also has its benefits,
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.320]   which is that we can actually,
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.600]   it's a safer place to build stuff.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.440]   You know, and I think--
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.120]   - Well look, guys, a game loft must agree with you
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.920]   because they've announced they're a game producer
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.560]   that they're scaling back their Android production
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.320]   and because of the weaknesses of its application store
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   and increasing their development for the Apple iPhone,
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.600]   probably because you sell a lot more games for there.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.760]   - Well, and I think that there's gonna be an issue
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.120]   with all of these phones is that while a lot of people
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.240]   are putting out great phones,
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.600]   I think that the issue is you're gonna start--
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.440]   - You don't know where the money is.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.400]   - Well, this is gonna be, this is how, you know,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.320]   once Microsoft got to a certain point where it pulled away,
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.920]   it becomes very hard to catch up.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.480]   And I think that people are having that trouble
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   with the iTunes store.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.240]   And I think people are gonna continue to have trouble
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.000]   with the app store related to the iPhone.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.920]   As the iPhone continues to sell the millions that it's selling,
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.120]   it's gonna be harder and harder and harder
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.960]   for anyone to catch up if AT&T and Apple really
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   had some semblance of, you know, we wanna finish this off.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.520]   If they just wanted to finish this thing off,
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.240]   what they would do is they'd start making it
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.360]   so there's no $99.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.160]   Like you can just get an iPhone with your subscription,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.000]   which makes--
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:31.920]   - Might as well, why not?
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.760]   - You might as well.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.440]   - Isn't that AT&T's decision, not Apple's decision?
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.600]   - It's both, I'm sure.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.400]   But the thing is, if AT&T just wanted to finish this thing off,
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   they would just make it so that next year
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.760]   you can get a free iPhone.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.320]   And it would, it would literally, you know, it would be,
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.120]   you know, I don't even know if Apple could supply that many,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.200]   you know, at that point, you know, 'cause when you really
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.960]   saw the huge jump is when we went down to $99.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.680]   You know, and I'm kind of surprised
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.320]   that they haven't done that to this point.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.280]   - Alexander de Rochefau, who is the finance director
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.520]   for Game Loft says they sell 400 times more games
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.960]   on iPhone that they do on Android.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.240]   - 400 times, not 400%.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.080]   - 400 times.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:12.920]   - 400 times.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.400]   - Yeah, which is 40,000%.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.200]   And he says that frankly, it's too hard
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.240]   to get promoted in the Android store.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.440]   People just don't know you exist,
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.160]   which is some people have complained about a problem
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.760]   as well on the Apple side.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.360]   - The funniest part of the promotion with Apple
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.560]   is that it might buy.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.240]   - I think I own almost every Apple ad.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.080]   - Yeah.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.920]   - So does everybody else?
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.740]   - Like I want to add that.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.580]   - That's the key.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.480]   - Those ads, I'm sure Apple does those ads
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.160]   as much for the ISVs as they do for the phone.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.720]   (laughing)
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.840]   It makes them happy.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.680]   - Yeah.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.760]   - All right, we're gonna wrap this guy up
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.280]   with our picks of the week.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.200]   Andy, Alex and I quick get to work.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.960]   I have extra, I have so many picks that if you guys--
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.800]   - Oh, I have a great one.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.640]   - I have a great one.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.280]   - I'm gonna go last 'cause I'm gonna let you guys
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.160]   steal my picks 'cause I have so many today,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.400]   I actually hope you do.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400]   Before we do that though, I wanna remember
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.560]   to remind you about audible.com
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.840]   and a special Thanksgiving deal from Audible this week.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.400]   If you go to audible.com/thanksgiving,
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.200]   you can get a book free.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.480]   Now this is, if you're already an Audible member,
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.320]   this is not for you.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.360]   This is for people who are not yet Audible members
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.800]   who would like to sample Audible.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.560]   And maybe some of you said,
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.080]   "I don't wanna give my credit card
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.360]   "or I don't wanna sign up for anything.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.720]   "I just wanna get a book for free."
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.080]   Well, go to audible.com/thanksgiving
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.640]   'cause your wish is Audible's desire.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.320]   Audible.com/thanksgiving.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.080]   I think this is only going on for a few more days.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.200]   Actually, it might be over now.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.760]   Let me see, let me make sure they're still doing this.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.680]   No, I'm still doing it.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.080]   Last chance though, get on over there.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.680]   And the big listen they call us,
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.440]   more than I think it looks like two dozen books
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.200]   that you can choose from,
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.800]   including your pick last week, Andy Badass.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.640]   Last week's pick.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.000]   Yeah, Badass is one of the free books.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.880]   Three Cups of Tea, really great book, highly recommended.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.640]   I'm gonna sign out so that I can look at this
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.320]   'cause I'm signed in and it says, "We're sorry.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.080]   "This is for new customers only."
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.440]   Oh, but I want a free book.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.120]   This is when you're glad you're new to audible.com.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.600]   You've resisted my import tunes all this time.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.480]   This is your payoff, this is your reward.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.320]   (laughing)
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.720]   For so long, you see there is a reward for being stubborn.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.120]   No credit card required, you just go, you just download.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.600]   But it's a great way to get introduced to audible.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   Oh, Metatropolis is available free.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.720]   That is really good.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.120]   That was their science fiction project from last year
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.200]   that I really liked.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.120]   We were giving that away, I remember.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.880]   Escape to Witch Mountain, there's some good choices for kids.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.760]   Red Wall, I love that book for kids, Badass.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.480]   Badass, Blackberry Planet.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.040]   I'm playing Mark Production.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.440]   It does, I know.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.640]   I told about three or four people about Badass this week
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.040]   saying, "You gotta get this one."
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.120]   Wizard of Oz, one of,
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.400]   Alice in the Charlie Wilson's War.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.800]   Fahrenheit 451, if you like sci-fi, I am legend.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.040]   If you're ready for the holidays, a Christmas Carol.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.440]   And this is, "Oh, a Confederacy of Denses"
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.480]   by John Kennedy Tool.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.480]   Flash forward.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.560]   Anyway, go to audible.com/Thanksgiving.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.760]   Get your free book right now.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.400]   And if you decide you like it,
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.560]   then I want you to go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.120]   and you can get the gold account
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.600]   and get another free book, two free books.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.400]   Anything you wanna recommend, Andy?
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.200]   I was just seeing, I saw Sarah Palin's a book is on.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.040]   (laughing)
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.000]   Have you listened to that yet?
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.880]   Going Rouge?
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.720]   Yeah, I can't wait to hear it.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.000]   It's like Rouge.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.160]   Well, I've heard it, it's mostly clicks, pops and buzzes.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.280]   It's, I believe it's not a fault with the encoding.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.960]   I think it was just my brain saying,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.160]   "I can't let you do this."
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.480]   (imitates buzz)
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.160]   No, I think this would be, I don't know.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.240]   I just, I think it'd be interesting.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.080]   Well, oh, all right.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:56.920]   Does she narrate it?
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.760]   I have to see, let me see.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.400]   I have to sign back in to find out.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.320]   Where's Stephen Warsen?
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.160]   Where's your friend?
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.520]   Where's the fucking--
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   Oh, come on!
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.840]   Oh, come on, it's a going Rouge in American life.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.200]   Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate,
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.560]   Sarah Palin's making headlines.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.040]   Oh yeah, Sarah narrates it.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.560]   Oh yeah, let's listen just a little bit there.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.920]   Good friend, Dr. Siegel.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.720]   See, let's just listen a little bit.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.440]   Yeah, friend Russia, be funny, wouldn't it?
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.240]   I know I did my own annoyance.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.320]   I still hadn't learned to accept the fact
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.280]   that political machines twist and distort public service
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.760]   and that a lot of times--
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.520]   (laughing)
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.880]   You know, if you're a Sarah Palin fan, this is hog heaven.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.800]   The first thing, you didn't fast forward.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.440]   That was like the first thing, like--
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.600]   That's the pick.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.720]   I don't think that, I don't think that,
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.200]   I don't think that like the person
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.040]   who chooses the clips was being delicious.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.720]   I just think, 'cause I was flipping through it
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.400]   and the bookstore and it's like,
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.840]   this was totally not my fault.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.640]   They twist and distort public service.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.240]   I made this other person for this.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.920]   The thing that you would blame me for for my behavior
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.680]   was totally not my fault, you know?
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.000]   Like, oh well, you're saying it's such a folksy way.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.960]   Of course you're not thinking.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.480]   Sure, you know what the difference is
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.840]   between a soccer mom and a pig?
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.120]   Very little they do makes any sense.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.400]   A pig has a sense of personal responsibility.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.760]   Years before, I had seen our state speeding
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.880]   toward an economic train wreck.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.520]   Since-- Anyway, that's one of the many books.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.080]   It's like 60,000 books of all political stripe.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.320]   You get your liberals too, you can take shots at them.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.040]   In fact, Al Franken does some great books on here.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.440]   But the point is, this is your library,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.600]   your bookstore, everything you'd want to listen to.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.880]   It's all here.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.440]   Audible.com/Macbreak to sign up for the gold account,
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.000]   but this week only.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.400]   Let me see when this expires.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.720]   You really want to go through November 26th,
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.120]   so you got two more days if you're listening live.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.040]   Is November 26th Thanksgiving?
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.840]   Yeah, it runs out on Thanksgiving Day,
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.920]   so I guess that makes sense.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.400]   It's the Thanksgiving giveaway.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.560]   Audible.com/Thanksgiving.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.440]   I think if thanks for Audible, I know you will too.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.120]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.840]   We should do a Thanksgiving episode of our shows
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.440]   in which we just thank everybody.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.280]   Thank you.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.680]   This show would not exist without people like you, Alex,
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.120]   and you, Andy, and all the great people,
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.640]   and all our great sponsors, and mostly our audience.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.600]   So I'm very grateful to all of you.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.400]   I'm especially grateful to Starbucks Coffee
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.520]   and Japotl Grill,
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.880]   which surely will be sending us each very large gift cards
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.720]   in exchange for the nice things we said.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.800]   Spontaniously hard.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.000]   You gave up on that Burger King card, did you?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.680]   Whatever happened, did you ever get a Burger King card?
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.640]   Oh, I got it.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.560]   I got it now.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.800]   I just, it's just that every time I use it,
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.640]   there's this discussion with the manager
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.800]   'cause they've never seen, what is this?
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.040]   Did you make this yourself?
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.640]   No, no, it's like, kick a call up.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.760]   The manager comes in and says,
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.640]   "I've never seen one of these before."
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.240]   I have a gold card.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.000]   Now, is your gold card good forever?
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.040]   It is, I believe it was a modified gold card.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.920]   I think there's enough credit on the card
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.720]   to comfortably satisfy a desire for the occasional burger.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.560]   I do not believe that could simply say,
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.400]   how many frozen patties you got back there?
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.360]   Great, I'll have them.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.240]   You couldn't buy the store.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.360]   Oh, no, see, if that were the possibility,
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.680]   that would be like my gift,
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.280]   like on Thanksgiving, you said,
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.480]   how much food do you have in there?
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.040]   Congratulations, you just got the rest of the day off.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.760]   I'm gonna buy you out completely.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.680]   (laughing)
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:26.680]   I don't care what you do with the store.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.120]   - Workers, for everyone's--
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:28.960]   - You can tell your manager,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.600]   we had no food left, some guy ordered 800 patties.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.080]   We had to close the store.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.920]   - Everybody gets a whopper.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.040]   - Yes.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.640]   Well, anyway, so yes, so Chipotle grill.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.920]   Andy is grateful for--
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.760]   - It's a hell of an app.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.640]   - Starbucks?
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.320]   Starbucks, it's true.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.160]   Look, I had, this show is powered by two coffees
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.600]   'cause Alex showed up with a triple tall latte
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.680]   and Frederique went out and got me a bus stop.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.320]   See, it says good coffee on it.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.160]   - Is it good?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.000]   - It is, it's very good.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.240]   This is a Mexican mocha, it's fantastic.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.600]   - Really?
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.960]   - So I'm actually powered by,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.520]   well, that would make five shots, I believe,
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.800]   of powerful gasoline.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.920]   - Gavey makes me a bit nervous.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.480]   - Mr. Andy Naco, do you wanna start this pick section?
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.640]   - Yes.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.840]   Now, nothing that happens bad on my computer
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.920]   is my fault, you betcha.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.520]   Whenever things slow down,
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.360]   it's not because I'm an incompetent manager
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.760]   of system resources, it's things that are outside
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.880]   of my control.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.760]   To that effect, when the greatest downloads I've had,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.040]   I think in the past two, three months,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.240]   has been clicked to Flash.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.440]   It is a perfectly slick above board plugin
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.120]   for any web kit browser, and of course,
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.440]   that includes Safari.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.880]   That simply adds a little, adds a little level
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.240]   of sophistication to use of Flash.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.680]   When you have this plugin installed,
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.800]   it's a simple installer, and then you restart Safari.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.520]   Any time there's Flash content,
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160]   you will not see the movie, or you will not see the ad,
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.120]   or you will not see the whatever.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.520]   You will see a very simple,
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.080]   super-state little gray box that simply says Flash.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.960]   And then you simply click on that to load in
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.240]   that content and execute it.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.400]   Or this, so the effect is that a website
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   that might have taken like 30 seconds to load in,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.680]   will take now five seconds to load it,
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.160]   'cause it's not bothering to load in
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.320]   and execute all these separate bits of code.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.640]   It also means that my browser doesn't slow down to a crawl
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.800]   in about 20, after being up for about two days,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.480]   because you don't have these like 10, 20, 30,
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.760]   40 little pieces of code hiding in all these different
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.560]   open windows and tabs.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   It also means that when I restart my browser,
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.640]   I don't, and re-open a window that might have had
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.760]   a YouTube video, there's no longer a chorus
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.280]   of eight different Flash things.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.640]   When I hit a website that has made the mistake
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.280]   of having an auto play Flash ad,
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.800]   it doesn't just start to pierce my eardrums
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.160]   with unwanted advertising.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.920]   And it just speeds up my browser,
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.000]   it stabilizes the browser in a way that I find
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.200]   extremely, extremely amplifying.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.160]   And it adds a bunch of new features too,
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.800]   above and beyond just simply blocking Flash.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.440]   Because if there are certain sites
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.480]   where the Flash is actually important,
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.520]   like if you go to likecnn.com and you're always clicking
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.000]   on the video, if you're going to YouTube specifically
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.320]   and you wanna make sure that you can actually see
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.360]   the YouTube videos, for each one of these little
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.800]   like grayed out boxes, there's also a little pop up gear
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.680]   of settings and functions so that you can simply say,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.240]   you can see that this content came from YouTube.com
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.960]   and then say, okay, well anytime there's content
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.880]   from YouTube.com, don't even ask,
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.360]   you can go ahead and play it.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.160]   You can, on YouTube specifically,
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.920]   there's also a second feature where,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.680]   since nearly all of their video is encoded in H.264
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.880]   as well as Flash, you can simply say,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.640]   don't show this to me as Flash,
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.360]   show this to me as QuickTime Video,
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.680]   you'll open it directly into Inside a QuickTime Player,
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.640]   which is a big, big deal for me because so often,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.360]   there'll be like a nine minute long video
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.400]   and I really only wanna see some bit,
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.720]   that's about three minutes into it.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.080]   One of the reasons why I was playing George Formby,
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.680]   but at the top of the show was I was watching
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.280]   a YouTube video of Peter Sellers
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.320]   and the clip was supposed to be about him playing
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.520]   George Formby's When I'm Cleaning Windows,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.000]   but it was in the middle of a nine minute long clip
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.640]   and the only way to really get to the thing
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.480]   I actually wanted to see was to use Click2Flash,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.640]   open it in QuickTime, it'll download the entire video
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.240]   directly from YouTube and then simply move the scrubber
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.840]   until I'm actually at the part where I want to actually see stuff.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.440]   So it's one hell of a nice enhancement.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.200]   It's not one of these hacks that tries to intercept
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.920]   what the browser is supposed to do.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.000]   It uses Apple's own mechanism,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.440]   the WebKit's built in mechanism for adding plugins
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.040]   and extending the functionality of the software,
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.080]   so it works perfectly and doesn't,
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.320]   doesn't throw any monkey wrenches into things.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.520]   And it's free, you can donate some money if you like it a lot,
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.360]   but you can just download it and just use it and love it.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.560]   - Very good, URL?
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   - URL, rentzzzj.github.com, R-E-N, again,
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:13.240]   this is why, you know, again, I have a name like Anako,
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.560]   I know it's hard to spell, that's why I decided
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.680]   to have a URL c-w-o-b.com.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   R-E-N, Z as in Z, S as in Z, C-H.G, GitHub.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:31.800]   - Why don't we just post that somewhere?
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.040]   - What should I Google?
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.120]   - Give me a Google term.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   - Google for click to flash, click the word to to to flash
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.520]   and you will find it.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.200]   - And I can say that it was very easy to find it
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.520]   and it's already installed and it works great?
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.360]   - Wow.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.400]   - While he was talking.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.520]   - All I was trying to spell R-E-N-T-Z-S-C-H.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.960]   No, now I'm sitting here looking at YouTube
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.560]   and it just says flash.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.280]   - There is a, for Firefox users,
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.920]   a flash block utility does the same thing.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.360]   I think it's a really good thing to block that flash.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.480]   - And I should point out that it's not simply a flash blocker,
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.520]   it simply gives you a level of control
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.040]   over how flash is executed on your machine.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.000]   'Cause like I said, you can have exceptions
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.440]   to simply say that this is a site
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.240]   where every time it uses flash, it's usually a good thing.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.280]   It can even be, even be selective,
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.320]   so as to say that if you're on like espn.com,
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.920]   flash that originates from espn.com,
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.320]   load it automatically, flash that does not originate
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.200]   from espn.com, let me choose.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.560]   You know, I haven't done a lot of plugins
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.480]   or haven't done any plugins I think for Safari,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.680]   so maybe one password.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.800]   Does it, is it easy to install these?
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.760]   You just, you put it in.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.000]   - It's a simple, really again, it is,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.400]   oh sorry, I can try to, I have a post-it note
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.920]   next to my camera saying do not say the word again again.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.600]   - Say that again, would you?
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.000]   - Oh, people, if it's a drinking game, drink up guys again.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.320]   - Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.160]   - Oh no, Thanksgiving is coming,
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.200]   you gotta build up your tolerance for--
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.840]   - Cold duck.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840]   - Korean War story.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:01.600]   - I just installed it.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600]   - That was easy.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.640]   - There's a built-in mechanism for plugins.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.480]   It is the existence of a piece of code
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.840]   inside a folder, inside your library folder.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.960]   That's all that has to happen.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.880]   - It did it very quickly and easily, that's great.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.400]   - So to remove it, the software that installs it
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.960]   can also de-install it, but if you want to skip that,
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.400]   you can just go into a certain plugins folder,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.520]   inside your library's folder, drag it off,
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.000]   restart your browser and it's gone.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.320]   - So now that it's installed, do I,
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.520]   oh I have to restart, okay.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.280]   - Okay, let's restart your browser.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.880]   - I like also that you can whitelist sites.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.840]   So there are many sites that you want to have Flash be
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.360]   available, I mean Flash adds a lot of great functionality.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.920]   And so you can say on that side,
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.080]   I know what I'm getting and that's fine.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080]   - Love that, that's great.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.120]   - See that big add, that big banner add
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.840]   that started every time I go to YouTube
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.480]   for wild dogs, hogs, whatever it is.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.440]   - And because of the whitelist feature, if you said,
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.720]   because that add is not hosted by YouTube,
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.520]   that gets blocked, you could say,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.440]   every time something is originated from YouTube.com,
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.920]   all that's gonna be a little automatically coming.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.560]   - That's really, really, really nice.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.280]   That's really nice, yeah.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.840]   Oh, and see that now, now it's loading.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.080]   I still don't want to see it.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.120]   - All right, it's your turn, Alex Lindsey.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.000]   What is your pick of the week, my friend?
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.560]   - I have a great application.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.760]   - Of course you do.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.880]   - How much is this gonna cost me?
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.960]   - Zero. - Zip, zip.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.120]   And you will not believe that this application is for free.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.480]   - Okay. - Okay, so it's called Wave Agent
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.400]   and you can go to waveagent.com.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.560]   Now if you go to waveagent.com,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.640]   what it's gonna do is it's gonna redirect you
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.480]   to sound devices.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.680]   Now to understand what sound devices
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.360]   makes the sound recorders that we use
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.600]   for all of our recording.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.920]   So everything we record goes through a version
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.360]   of a sound device, a 702T,
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.320]   a 788T, we're getting them.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.480]   - I'm John from Sound Devices.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.320]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.920]   - And I want to refill a John.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.080]   And he's talking right now.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.000]   - And actually John was in my office last week
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.320]   and so he was pointing this out and I was like,
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.760]   oh my gosh, I have to talk about this
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.120]   because what it is, is it is,
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.200]   a lot of times we have things we want to convert sound files,
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.040]   we want to do all these other things.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.320]   Sometimes you don't want to do all of that.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.680]   All you want is you just want to know what's on the sound file.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.960]   You don't want it to be heavy,
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.040]   you don't want it to go through a lot of conversion,
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.160]   you just want to see what's there.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.840]   So what this allows you to do is simply load up
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.360]   a whole bunch of audio files and then play them.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.960]   So I can hit play and it'll just play them back.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.000]   Now it'll tell you all this stuff about it.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.120]   But it tells you all the information.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.600]   You can change the information,
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.480]   you can change what its frame rate is,
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.520]   what its sample rate is.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.280]   These are all things that are in the metadata.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.720]   You can split the track.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.800]   So let's say you record them an eight track thing
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.280]   and you want to just split out all the tracks.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.120]   That's all you want to do.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.360]   You don't want to recompress it.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.000]   You don't want to change the structure of it.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.360]   All you want to do is load up an eight track video.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.600]   I mean audio and just hit split
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.000]   or you want to combine the tracks
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.320]   and you can combine the tracks.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.160]   - Oh, I can really use this.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.000]   We work with audio all the time.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:27:59.840]   - You can rename them.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.680]   You can grab a whole bunch of files,
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.160]   listen to them, delete the ones you delete files
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.400]   or you can just sit there and pull them all in
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.920]   and then just say copy all the files
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.760]   that I left in this area to a new folder.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.600]   Like grabbing from all these different areas.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.040]   And all of this stuff is,
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.200]   it's a tool that a lot of us using audio files.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.680]   It doesn't do too much.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   It does just what you need to organize files.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.440]   If you add scenes and takes,
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.480]   a lot of this stuff is designed for sound devices
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.000]   is heavily used in the film industry.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.040]   And so a lot of this is,
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.240]   you'll see a scene takes circled, wild track,
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.400]   what project, so on and so forth.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.600]   You can have all of that information
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.000]   and then you can rename all the files
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.200]   based on that information that you added.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.040]   Anyway, it's free.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.520]   It's free, there's no reason not to download it.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.040]   So it is a great, great little application
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.880]   that I can't believe I didn't know about until last week.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.360]   Wave Agent, and you can just go to waveagent.com
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.480]   or you can go to sound devices and find the download area.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.320]   But waveagent.com is the easiest place to find it.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.480]   - And I have, thank you, Alex Lizzie.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.280]   I have as my pick three, not one, not two,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.800]   but three different programs that have been significant,
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.640]   programs that have been updated.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.560]   - Since we last spoke, I'm gonna start with one password,
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.400]   which is finally out with its version three
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.880]   that will work with Stole Leopard.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.720]   - There you go.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.920]   - Unfortunately, not a free upgrade,
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.960]   but there are a lot of new features.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:25.440]   One password works with the iPhone, which is great.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.640]   It keeps track of your logins, your passwords.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.800]   You have secure notes, you can even store things
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.440]   like software licenses and it has a new section
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440]   just for software licenses.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.680]   So that makes it a little easier.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.240]   You can attach files to it, which is great.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.040]   For instance, one password's license is a file.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.080]   They have a really clever licensing thing.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.200]   They give you a JPEG that you drag onto one password
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.520]   and it's the licenses somehow embedded in that.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.360]   It's very clever.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:53.560]   You can edit items in the browser.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.760]   It's got tagging, syncs with your iPhone
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.080]   and your touch Safari login bookmarklet.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:02.480]   They've really updated this significantly.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.960]   However, if you haven't purchased it $40
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.880]   and well worth it, unfortunately,
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.560]   if you have one password too, which I do,
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.600]   you have to upgrade.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.200]   If you bought since February,
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.560]   I mean, they're being fairly generous.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.240]   I bought it well before February,
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.880]   I've owned one password for a long time.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.840]   You can upgrade for free and if you bought it before February,
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.240]   well, and you have to pay for a little upgrade,
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.240]   but I have to say this is well worth it.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.720]   So that's one for those who use one password.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.600]   Upgrade is out, version three is out now.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.120]   And if you don't, it is easily the best password
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.720]   management utility on the Macintosh.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:46.720]   Two handbrake 0.9.3 was released over the weekend.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.080]   What are you giggling about, Andy and not co?
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.760]   - Oh no, I just-- - You're giggling.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.680]   - I think they're using Zeno's paradox
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.480]   as a way of releasing software.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.800]   - Inching close.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.360]   They need to get to, the first one was,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.280]   the guys from zero to 1.0, first they released 0.5
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.280]   and 0.75, then 0.87, now 9.3, then 9.4, the 9.41.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.520]   They will never get to 1.0.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.600]   - Never-- - You know, I think it's actually
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.000]   a really good development.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.200]   - It's smart. - You know, that way,
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.520]   you don't wanna get-- - You're like,
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:17.640]   "Hey, I'm still working on it."
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.440]   We're not even in version 1.0 yet.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.800]   - It is Windows and Mac, but it's always worked best on the Mac.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.320]   And by the way, now accepts any kind of video,
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.320]   they're using FFmpeg and the libraries Lib, AV codec
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:32.600]   and Lib AV format so that they can take anything.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:35.080]   Of course, it is a great DVD ripper.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.480]   Word of warning, it does not contain anything
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.400]   to remove encryption from DVDs,
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:43.600]   but if you have VLC installed, it just uses its library.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.320]   Does that automatically?
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.600]   They say the video quality's been improved,
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.000]   thanks to improvements in the X264 project.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.800]   So they say dramatically enhanced picture quality
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.680]   if using H.264.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.400]   - Through the use of psycho visual rate distortion
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.440]   and adaptive quantization.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.440]   They also say it's faster.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.280]   Persistent queues, which is nice
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.760]   because after a crash, I always had to rebuild the queue,
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.240]   it remembers it now.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.640]   And quite a bit more, including improved audio video
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.840]   synchronization, which is always a complaint
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.160]   when you're doing this kind of transcoding.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.920]   Theora is now in there.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.040]   Handbrake 0.9.2 from handbrake.fr.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.480]   And my final update, and it's been a long time since
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.880]   we've seen an update of Camino.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.160]   2.0 is out.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.920]   Camino was the browser before, you know,
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.040]   Apple and Firefox came along.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.640]   I believe it's built on WebKit.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.800]   Does a lot of the same things that WebKit does.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.280]   It's the most mackish of browsers.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.640]   And I'm glad to see that they're still developing
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.080]   an open source, very mack focused
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.520]   universal application so it should run even on power PC,
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.400]   which is something you can't say for so far and for.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.520]   You know, I don't, but I thought when it came out,
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   I thought I'd give it a try.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.720]   Now they've added tabs.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.600]   It's, you know, it's comparable.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.160]   I'd say it's comparable.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.640]   I have to admit, I bounce back and forth.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.160]   I have different uses for Firefox.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.160]   It used to be the speediest.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.880]   Yeah, I don't need a third browser either.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.160]   But I thought I'd make mention.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.480]   You know, it used to be the thing where
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.720]   it was the most cocoa-like browser for the Mac.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.080]   Safari might have taken that crown away,
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.480]   but Safari is getting buttoned us and feature itus.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.320]   So I don't know.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.240]   It's certainly worth looking at.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.400]   They've got tabs now.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.240]   They've got phishing and malware protection,
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.560]   download notifications using Growl.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.400]   I don't know what annoyance blocking is,
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.880]   boy, if you can have annoyance blocking.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.960]   Oh, it's a, it blocks pop-ups, ads and flash animations.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.800]   All together.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.640]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.320]   I like that on my iPhone for sometimes people around me.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.160]   Yeah, Apple.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.360]   Scripting, it's a good Apple scriptable application.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.760]   Lot of, you know, a lot of support for Apple-ish standards.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.560]   It's, oh, actually it's not WebKit, it's Gecko.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.080]   So it's using the Firefox engine.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.200]   It's Gecko 1.9.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.480]   So that's good to know.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.640]   So if you've got Safari, you don't want to use Firefox.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.120]   It probably will work with a lot of the Firefox extensions,
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.280]   although I haven't tried that.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.200]   So three new versions of three classic Mac apps,
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.800]   One Password, Handbrake and Camino.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.400]   That's my pickish of the weekish.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.840]   And I think we are,
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.920]   we've run the ship aground.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.240]   We're done.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.200]   We have run the ship aground.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.440]   We've run this right into the ground.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.360]   There's nothing left to do,
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.200]   but see if we can get our deposit back on the rental.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:39.440]   I do hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.360]   Enjoy your turkey day.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.560]   For those of you outside of the country,
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.760]   with this is this thing we do, we get around,
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.000]   we get together with family and friends.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.960]   Have turkey, get sleepy, watch football,
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.560]   and go buy Black Friday deals.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.320]   We still don't know if that 25% off Mac's deal
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.880]   was a fake or real, we'll know by next Monday.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:00.000]   But Apple has said, if you go to the Apple store,
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.960]   we're gonna have some special deals
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.040]   the day after Thanksgiving.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.440]   They even say it in the UK Apple store,
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.760]   where of course there is no Thanksgiving.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.120]   They just say, "Friedays gonna be a good day."
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.920]   - We're spreading the Thanksgiving love.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.800]   - Friday's gonna be a good day.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.280]   Boy Genius Report does have that Apple Black Friday brochure,
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.240]   and they say it's been leaked one more time.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.400]   So boy, this is even more detail.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.120]   Whoever's the Photoshop wizard behind this
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.460]   is really putting some effort into these deals.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:37.880]   IMAX starting at 1,098 iPod Nanos at 138 bucks iPod touch,
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:44.360]   $178 MacBook Pros, $1,098 MacBook Pro.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.720]   Apple TV, 208 bucks, Airport Express 88 bucks.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.080]   I'd buy an Airport Express for 88 bucks.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.760]   - It's a lot of work if you're making a fake.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.240]   - Boy, it's a lot of work.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.600]   - Yeah, and those are realistic sounding discounts.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.120]   It's not Airport Express, $19 MacBook Pro, $40.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.200]   - And by the way, not at the Apple store,
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.640]   you have to go online according to this ad,
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.680]   fake or real we don't know.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.720]   Go to Boy Genius Report, you can see the details.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.560]   - Wouldn't be surprised.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.960]   I mean, you just think about the mayhem that would...
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.720]   - Oh yeah, you can't do this at the stores.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.560]   And it is, would be one day only.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.280]   Now they've done that before with the only on Black Friday.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.960]   So even if you don't have Thanksgiving,
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.280]   you do have Black Friday, I'm happy to say.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.240]   So enjoy your turkey and or,
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.720]   your deals at the Apple store.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.440]   We'll be back next week for another Mac Break Weekly.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.820]   But now, get back to work,
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.480]   break time is over.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   (upbeat music)
