[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160]   We have put together some of the best moments
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.680]   from the year gone by.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.920]   And I tell you, there's some really fun, funny, deep,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.320]   informative stuff.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.200]   If you're a Macbreak Weekly fan, you've probably seen a lot of this.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480]   Maybe not all of it.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.880]   I think you're going to enjoy.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.440]   And don't forget, we'll be back every Tuesday

[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.520]   And happy new year, everybody.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.480]   All right, you ready for another quadcopter tour
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.720]   of the Apple campus in 4K video?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.280]   This is the January update.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960]   Should I go to-- let me see.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.200]   Should we go to 4K?
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.640]   I don't know what it's going to look like.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.360]   I mean, this is in a 4K screen.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.840]   Give it a shot.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560]   People at home are watching it in 720p anyway.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.880]   But all right, I'll look on the clarity in that.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.400]   Oh my god, it actually does look pretty good.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160]   Here we go.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.080]   What are you looking at?
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.480]   Get rid of that.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.360]   There you go.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.920]   Here we go.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   This is the Circle campus, the Infinity campus.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.560]   It's well underway.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   What you can do when you got $10 billion
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.080]   has been done on them.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.040]   Nice.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   Nice.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.040]   No bugs here.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840]   There's going to be a parking garage underneath.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.960]   I'm shooting on the landscaping.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520]   I'll make this look beautiful, of course.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920]   I love the music.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.320]   It's kind of James Bondy.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.360]   Dad, I worked at Skawak Ranch.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.120]   You know, almost all the-- you've been there, right?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520]   Yeah, almost all the parking is all under the building.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   Yeah, smart.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.240]   But that's a Sylvan environment.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.920]   You're kind of in the woods.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.520]   And so are we looking back to one infinite loop?
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.000]   Is that what we're seeing?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   Or is he just showing off now with this quadcopter?
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   He's a little smoggy in San Jose.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   Look at that 4K.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.920]   I'm going to tell you.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.720]   Look at that 4K.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   Super crisp.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.160]   There's another article somewhere about how they agreed to preserve a historic barn that
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   was on the HP campus.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   Yeah, can you believe that?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   Crazy.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   According to the article, they took it apart board by board, numbered every board, numbered
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.360]   every fastener, are rebuilding it near one of the athletic fields on the new campus so
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.240]   that will now be a working tool shed.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.120]   With pride saying for the first time in years it will be a working barn once again, holding
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   the fertilizer, the manganese.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   How will--
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   --howls back the occasionally sleep there and--
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   Get ready done.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Get ready done.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.840]   How old is that historic barn?
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.440]   It's like 80 years old.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Ooh.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.760]   Well, for fact, in America, you know, we don't have anything--
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Relate bloomers.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   Old.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.520]   What would historic be in Liverpool?
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080]   Entire housing estates that are older than that.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   And they're definitely not historic.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.320]   Yeah, well, I went past my brothers.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.480]   My brothers just moved and went past the house and had 17, 19 up on the door.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   So, yeah, it's--
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   That one's getting on a little.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.080]   You guys park your cars on top of the final resting places of 600-year-old kings.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   You're--
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Oh, you have this old old hat.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   Do we dig up King Richard III or just, you know, we got--
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.720]   Hey, he's in a car park.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   We don't--
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.160]   We got plenty of kings and plenty of churches.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.560]   We can deal with this.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.360]   So, there it is.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.200]   That's the-- I think we're still a couple of years off.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.600]   We're going to get invited for tour.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.800]   I want to-- that's what-- I'll tell you--
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.280]   Well, if something happens to you, isn't that?
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.520]   Yeah, that's where they're going to have all the events from now on.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.800]   If I have any sadness about being kind of somehow off the list-- I'm not going to use
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.560]   the B word band word, but somehow off the list is that I won't get to visit this.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.120]   Thank you, meyithz.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   Or whatever that is for doing this.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.920]   You can visit the campus, just, you know, visit thrift stores until you acquire an entire
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   domino's uniform.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   Fit a pizza box with a ray of GoPro cameras.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   Candy Graham--
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.360]   --a special-- especially how you shaved your head because--
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   Pizza Graham.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   --you're suited for locks or--
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   And they won't recognize it.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.040]   I want to start with not the watch because this isn't-- that wasn't-- there wasn't much
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.960]   new there, but with the Mac book, which was rumored, but the rumor came true.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   It's all real.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   It came true.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.360]   And I was having a little fight in the chat room with some people in the chat who said,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.000]   oh, that's a crappy computer.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   Who would want a computer?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.960]   We're talking about the new Mac book.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.320]   Two pounds, 16 millimeters thick, which is not much thicker than an iPad, really.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.080]   But one connector, the USB-C connector.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.880]   Jason, is that too few?
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.800]   I mean, you're-- I actually use you as an example.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   I was running the SEU2.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   Oh, Lebanon chairs.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   --both of your users and the webinchers.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   Yeah, you know, I would say-- I'm going to go out on the limb here and say that anybody
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.920]   who's in an IRC chat room watching a live stream of just weekend tech shows--
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   It probably has a lot of wires coming in.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.040]   --maybe not the people who this product is for.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.600]   I mean, this is the iPad of laptops.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   It's meant to be super simple.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.280]   It's meant to be the laptop that's at the edge of Apple's product line of laptops.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.000]   The Mac book as a product means there's room for the Mac book pro, right?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I mean, that's the--
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Well, they think that's the name.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   --in the exact name.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Either the Air or the Pro.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   Will they, Serenity, is that-- is this kind of the beginning of the end for the Air?
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   This might be the burgeoning of a new Mac book empire, but I don't necessarily think
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.840]   that it's going to come in the next six months.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   I mean, Apple spent a surprising amount of time on wireless specs during their presentation
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.080]   on how, oh, wireless is the future.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.600]   You don't want to be tethered to wires.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.960]   You want all day battery life.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.800]   You want wireless beets, headphones.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.720]   You want to live a wireless life if you're using a laptop.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   But they're right, I think.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.080]   No, I think they're absolutely right.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.960]   I don't know if we're quite there yet.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.040]   We were talking before the show.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   You were taking photos and then you were tapping, using NFC to tap them to your phone.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   Wireless?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.600]   Yeah, wireless, which is great, but it's a little bit harder to do that with a DSLR
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   to a Mac right now.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.240]   You know, there is an NFC support.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.080]   An AirDrop doesn't exactly work with a Sony or a Canon camera.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.240]   So there are still things that you might need some wires for currently.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.400]   And also, you know, there was a, at the event, Apple's like, all day battery life.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.080]   And I'm like, wait, is this, is this true?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.640]   Are we going to get, you know, 12, 14 hours?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.880]   The day just got shorter.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.920]   It's the same, it's the same nine, 10 hour battery life of the iPad and also the 11 inch
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.480]   air with the 11 inch air starts out.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.920]   You get it in nine hours.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.200]   Now the 13 inch MacBook gets more 13 hours.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.360]   This is the adapter Apple's going to sell you.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.960]   And I think if you take a Mac book home, you probably want to take home the $79 USB C digital
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:22.080]   AV multi-board adapter, which gives you a HDMI full HDMI out full USB and power.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.320]   So basically now with this little dongle, you plug this into the type C and you can power
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   up.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.560]   You can have USB and you can have.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   Oh, crap.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   Is that elegant?
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.960]   Alex Lindsey, what is Mirkat besides a small desert dwelling gritter from Africa?
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.240]   This is, so this is Mirkat.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.840]   And you can see your Mirkat.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   You know, why don't I, why don't I, for purposes, so you see what it looks like as you stream.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   So here's my Mirkat.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.680]   So I'm looking around and everything else.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.880]   Now I'm in Rwanda from, oh, my iPhone and I'm streaming to Twitter.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   Jason, show my show.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.280]   I'm on 42 seconds over the show.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   You know, to do this.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   I mean, like it was, it's crazy.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   You push a button.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   It tweets, right?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.160]   And then it tweets, it's watching, which is so cool.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.560]   I actually really like that.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.800]   And there's a chat on it.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.200]   So the people are chatting to me here.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   From a, from a social tie in it's, it's really, really interesting.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.160]   And the fact that to be up now, I do a lot of live streaming and I know that impromptu
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.600]   live streaming does not usually yield very many viewers.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Right.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.400]   So the idea that in a couple of minutes I have 71 viewers is actually pretty good.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.600]   You know, that you know, that's 500 people watching this Mirkat.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   You've got five now.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Exactly.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   Exactly.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.840]   So it's the, let's see if I can spin this thing around.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.080]   But, but I think that this is a, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   It's pretty solid.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.480]   I mean, it works, it works pretty well.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   Absolutely.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   Well, I have to admit, I had it on my phone and I, in this morning on the way to work,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.240]   on the way to the school, I was just in the, in the cab and I just turned it on.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.560]   And I just couldn't believe that it was coming out smoothly and working and everything else.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.760]   And so, so anyway, it is a, it's a pretty amazing.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.320]   So Jason's watching my Mirkat right now.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.640]   What are you watching that on Jason?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.240]   How are you doing that?
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.640]   You have to resize the browser to a portrait format.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.240]   So you can watch it on the browser.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   Yeah, you can.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   So this is it.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   Not resized.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   Right.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.760]   This is why this is the perspective we're normally used to having.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.440]   But if you resize the window to a portrait and you hit one another class.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   When you, so you can schedule a stream ahead of time, but or you can, and then it'll
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.440]   tweet out, oh, tune in as I did at two and into 12, 50 years, going to stream or that
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.560]   you could just start a stream and it'll tweet it out.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   And does it continue to read to tweet like I've been on for 40 minutes now.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.960]   Does it continue to people want to look at the story?
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.000]   I'm going to get me off to there.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Did you start?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   You're doing it too.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   This is like Mirkat inception.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   Boy, now I got to find out.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.600]   Everyone, everyone pointed the camera.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   Everyone pointed the camera right now.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   Wow.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   We'll have a little more.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   Wow.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   We'll have our all broadcast, our individual shows that we have.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   You do like live action.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   We'll have a camera.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   You got somebody cameras around here.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   I know.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   So eight people are watching right now.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.800]   What, so have you been using it for a while?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.720]   No, no, I just, I've been hearing about it.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.240]   Everyone keep on telling you, oh, you got to look at me, you know, because what I do.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.320]   Everyone keeps on telling me that I have to look at Mirkat.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.960]   And so I finally had it, I down loaded it immediately and I just didn't get around to
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   it.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.760]   When I opened it up, I just thought it was so cool that anyway, that's why it's my pick.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.880]   There's a little bit of latency on it.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.680]   What is about half a minute, 40 seconds?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   Something like that.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   Yeah, it's probably about that.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   Something like that.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.560]   I can't tell because you're not on, but we're looking at these now.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   There we go.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   Now we're looking at Alex.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   That's Alex.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   Here we go.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   I'm going to go.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   I'm going to snap.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   Okay, I snapped.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   This is a little bit insane.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   It's your kind of inception.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.160]   We need to get the people who are listening to the audio only version of this podcast or
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   completely.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Oh, they're very confused.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   I'm about 15 right now.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   Yep.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   So I've got 28.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   I'm beating you, Renee.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Oh, so you can receive a mere cat.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.360]   That was probably about 15, 20 seconds.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   You can receive a mere cat on a browser.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.160]   You can receive it on a phone.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.080]   It is not Android yet.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080]   It's iOS only.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.320]   And it really went viral just in the last couple of weeks, partly because of product
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   hunt.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.440]   But then yesterday we saw that a number of people were going to mere cat the keynote,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.280]   which is kind of silly since it's already a good stream.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.200]   It was your cat road rage because people were trying to mere cat the same watch table
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.480]   and yelling, "Dad, am I mere cat?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480]   Oh no, really?
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   Yeah."
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   There was almost like, there was almost brawls.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.880]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.560]   I'm definitely going to use this for Derby.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.360]   This is actually, this is really exciting.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.880]   So what's great about it is, yeah, you can do kind of ad hoc streaming.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.120]   We certainly spend a lot of money to design a streaming studio.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.240]   I don't really need mere cats since I spend plenty of time on streaming live streaming
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   video.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.120]   But there's something personal and intimate about it as well.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.640]   So now I'm going to mere cat, Jason's mere cat.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   I'm mere catting, Liam.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   You're cutting, Jason.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   You're getting, you're getting.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   You're getting, you're cutting.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   All right, how about that?
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   Oh, what's your name?
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   Jad.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.040]   Maybe this is the way we should do the show from now on.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   No, right.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   It's a multi-camera.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.160]   You know, I do think that this is going to be something that's going to transform news.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.880]   I mean, I think that's the thing is something's going to happen and suddenly there's going
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.880]   to be mere cats.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.960]   You know, it's going to be a swarm of mere cats.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.080]   You know, on, you know, on, you know, those types of things.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.000]   There's a swarm of mere cats right now.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Look at that.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.200]   So the interesting thing is that Twitter just bought a company that does exactly this.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.400]   Is it called Pumba Mode?
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   It's Pumba.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   Periscope.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   No, it's Periscope.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.480]   And I think that unfortunately they just missed the boat because MIRCAD is obviously snagged.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.280]   Everyone had a nap.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   It is about Twitter.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.520]   Without Twitter, it means nothing, right?
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   I mean, they integrate it right into Twitter.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.920]   Remember, um, quickly, oh, we need the You Are Cali with you.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   That's much fun.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   Quick.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   I know.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   I know.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   I know.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   I know.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   I know.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   And social camera.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   You can save this.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   You can save this.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   You can save this.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   Okay.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   Now, this is what's weird.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   I think it also is.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   Presumably.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   If you wanted to.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   You could post it somewhere.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.360]   And I think part of that is also the quality of the video that you post to be much higher
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.640]   quality than what it would have recorded from the live stream as well as that's a whole
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.920]   nother problem of scale.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.280]   So if they start scaling and they didn't have somewhere to put all those videos, they're
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.920]   now in YouTube's business of trying to manage all of that.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   So it took me, I took me a second to figure that out.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   I was like, oh, right.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.460]   They don't want to start that way because no, that's a very expensive thing to do is
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.560]   to serve all those videos around the company.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.920]   I'm from the tidbits of saying is watching all of our videos at the same time.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   Who is that?
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   I'm not Josh.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   Center's.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   Oh, how funny.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   Very weird.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.160]   Your cat's option that's happening.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.640]   I have used all of these and I've used, you know, social cam and quick and all of that.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.360]   And I'm sure this will be just another flash in the pan, but they did do some things that
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   not near cadding.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   I am.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.600]   Andy's like totally not interested in this business.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.360]   And you looking at like that.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Andy will not bet.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.200]   No, I just told him we're not going to college anymore.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.440]   I'm just thinking about what I'm going to go.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   No, no, no.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.840]   I just think that you should set yourself a limit that the juggling does not work out
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   after one year.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.120]   Maybe you should take your job at your own big lumber years.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.640]   No, what I actually really like about this is it's integrated.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.120]   Yeah, sorry, chatroom.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.760]   I turned off my mere cat feed because I got you.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   I got you.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.160]   But I really like how easy this is to set up and how quickly you're going to be.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.520]   And I see that I can get a good stream going almost immediately.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.960]   And hook in with Twitter.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.080]   There's like you stream is nice, but there's the separate chat room and it's kind of insane.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.360]   And I don't know.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   It's complicated.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.720]   If you want to stream anything good, you need to pay for a subscription.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.240]   Like again, I'm thinking about roller derby here because my mind always goes to.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.640]   There is a kind of neat real time aspect to this and the instant aspect of this live streaming
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.320]   roller derby games is really difficult because you could do this on your.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.080]   You could attach this to your your.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.440]   Oh, yeah, I absolutely could.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.880]   I mean, I'd probably put it in an otterbox first.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   Jammer.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   Yeah, no, I can.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   Who did invent type C mark?
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.840]   Do you have any idea because Google is also taking credit.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   Right.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   So John Gruber said that Apple had a large hand in it and something about them coming
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   up with it.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.520]   But based on documentation available on the USB foundation's website, it seems like a
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.600]   lot of different companies had a hand in it.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.800]   And it is interesting that Apple was first to announce actual shipping hardware with
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.400]   it and Google came out just the very next day.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.880]   And Apple does have a patent on something that looks a lot like a type C connector.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:44.680]   Pat and Lee, Pat and Lee Apple has a basically a reversible cable, which seems to be very
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.320]   similar.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.840]   This is a video from Stefan Zvarling.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.440]   But you can kind of see the patent Lee Apple post.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.800]   I have to see if I can find the original post.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.520]   I heard the same thing that Gruber heard.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.160]   I mean, it definitely was a team effort, but you know, sometimes there are people who
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.600]   lead a team or have ideas or contribute to a team where just get the team going in the
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.840]   direction that they want.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.160]   And this is very much the direction that they want in an industry standard.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160]   You wouldn't expect one team.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.000]   I mean, Apple worked with Intel on Firewire.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.160]   Underbully, you know, 1348.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   Thunderbolts is standard, right?
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.960]   But the patent that you showed, I think that's actually lightning.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.560]   No, it's a lightning.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   Okay.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   USB, Sean, and Pat and Lee Apple.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.840]   A lot of times some of those patent websites, they mix up things that have happened years
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   ago.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.640]   Well, as you know, you can't credit a patent.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   Everybody patents everything.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.920]   And that was the same team involved with USB C as far as I know.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.280]   So this is the PDF from the USB 3 promoter group.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   Good Lord.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:53.480]   Could you have a more 1986 logo too?
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.080]   That doesn't inspire you to confidence.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.040]   Super speed plus.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.400]   Is the type C on the MacBook a 3.0?
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.040]   It's a 3.1 connector, isn't it?
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.000]   It's the latest.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.480]   And to your point earlier, there's some discussion about whether this precise Broadwell chipset
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.880]   that Apple is using supports the dual dual side ports or the architecture of the MacBook
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.080]   would allow them to have a controller on both sides.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.160]   This is going for ultra-thin, ultra-light, not for spanability.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.480]   Nor does it have two channels.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.680]   Some USB 3.1 has two channels, but this is I think 10 gigabits is plenty, but it's one
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   10 gigabit channel.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.440]   Of course, you choose your compromises in your design.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.240]   So some have raised the issue of USB is a somewhat dangerous interface.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:46.040]   You've seen bad USB, it's called, which is malware that infects USB firmware and can
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.480]   be used to then infect the computer it's put into.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.680]   Typically with thumb drives, because weirdly enough, virtually all thumb drives, even
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.080]   the most secure, have electronically erasable prompts, EE prompts that you could put new
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   firmware in.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.400]   Bad USB takes advantage of it by hacking the firmware of the USB and then infecting everything
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   you plug it into.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.840]   Now, I understand that the Apple power adapter doesn't have any firmware in it.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.600]   You can't be reprogrammed, so it doesn't have that capability.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.920]   The issue is though, not Apple's adapter or even Google's adapter, but maybe going to
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.560]   a coffee shop, hackers corner and plugging into their USB to charge might have an adverse
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   effect.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.840]   It's the cost of being a standard.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.760]   You want to have standard compatibility.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.960]   It's not unique to USB-C, it's not unique to Apple, the Chromebook Pixel, the same thing
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.680]   with ever-
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   Absolutely.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   Anything.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   Absolutely.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.280]   It would be difficult to secure it.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.800]   There are ways to hardware secure, but then you break compatibility, especially with older
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   devices.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.200]   It's something that maybe Apple could do a prompt on OS 10 the way they do in iOS where
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.920]   it says, "Do you want to trust whatever you're plugging into this device?"
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.720]   They're pretty good at interfacing with the Intel circuitry.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.200]   Hopefully, something will come of it, but it's the cost of using USB for business now.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.560]   There's also a difference there because if you are really, really concerned about security
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.280]   and we're not just talking about, "I don't want to surf a porn site and get malware I'm
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.920]   talking about, I'm entering another country where I feel as though my laptop is going to
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.280]   be a target of something."
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.160]   If you have a different kind of port, then you have the option of simply not plugging.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.480]   If you have a separate port that's just for power, you have the option of never connecting
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.080]   a data device to that machine ever.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.760]   However, given that there's only one port and it's the only way to get power into the
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.480]   thing, it would be possible for someone with an unusual interest in your machine to compromise
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   your power adapter.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.160]   Because what are you going to do?
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   Keep buying it.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.400]   Travel with 10 fully charged up MacBooks and then just throw them out every time the battery
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   dies.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.840]   No, you're going to have to plug something in there sometime and that's an opportunity
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.280]   for someone to get access.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.240]   Obviously, we're not talking about a threat that anybody really is going to be facing,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.640]   but it's not a threat that nobody will face and you like to have at least one option there.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.560]   It's like iOS where you have just a lightning port and juice-jacking was common for a time
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.080]   and that's why they created the trusted device request here to begin with.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   I imagine it's probably best to think of the MacBook as an iOS, almost an iOS device based
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.240]   on how it's set up and how the ports work.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.560]   I think iOS solution would be the best thing there.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.080]   Tim Cook says I'm giving it all away.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:40.440]   The article in Fortune Magazine says he's worth about $785 million.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:48.400]   He's going to pay for his 10-year-old nephew's college education and then whatever's left.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.040]   He will give away.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.200]   This is in the tradition of Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, who have all
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.680]   committed to giving at least half their worth away.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.400]   It's called the Giving Pledge.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.240]   I don't actually, Tim Cook's not on that list, but it's in that same spirit.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.920]   We think that's a little bit longer though because his nephew isn't going to go to college
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920]   for under eight years.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.880]   The way college costs are going, $785 million might not be as much as it seems like.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   I would say yes.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.760]   Well, also, if I knew I was getting that deal, I would say, "Hey, guess what Uncle NASA
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.920]   is agreed to let me do a semester at sea in the International Space Station.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   That'll be $40 million."
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.080]   Hey, if I have anything left in my kids college fund after their eight, nine, ten years in
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.880]   college, I promise to give that all away as well.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   You have my word on it.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.080]   I think I'm running out already two years in.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.520]   That is a pretty cool proposition though.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.360]   When you think about what you could do if you have tens of millions of dollars to disperse,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.400]   it seems as though the least satisfying thing imaginable would be to simply let it be your
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.120]   children or your relatives' problem after you die.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.440]   The idea of sitting there and thinking, "What problem do I want to solve forever for some
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   city or some institution?"
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.440]   The idea that I'm going to put $30 million into an endowment fund so that this library
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.320]   or this educational system is always funded so long as they don't screw things up like
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   try to launch a startup or something like that.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.240]   I'm just saying, if you wanted to give away your entire Justice League action figure collection,
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.280]   not hand it off to your kids, I know somebody had taken.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.440]   That would be roughly my half-minute worth, so that would be a freaking good gesture.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.480]   Tim Cook told Fortune he already has started donating money quietly, but he wants to develop
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.920]   a more systematic approach to philanthropy.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.560]   That's exactly what Bill Gates said.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.360]   Bill Gates, before he started being a philanthropist while he was still running Microsoft, was
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.880]   often asked, "You're the richest man in the world.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   Why aren't you giving more away?"
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.800]   He says, "Because I don't have the time to do it right."
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.760]   The minute he retired, he started the Gates Foundation with Melinda, his wife, and now
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.720]   they are giving it all of it, or most of it.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.560]   I think he wants to give 95 percent of it away.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.040]   I think that's great.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   More power to him.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.480]   What are you going to do with $785 million, especially if you don't have kids?
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.800]   Buy a library or something.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   No.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   That's something.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   Again, I've always thought that not on that kind of grand scale, but how many times do
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.480]   you open up a newspaper or open up a news feed and see that, "Oh, well, some church or
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.800]   some library had a snow roof collapse and it's going to cost them $7,000 to fix it,"
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.600]   and they're not really sure where it's going to come from.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.800]   The ability to sit your desk and say, "Don, here's a check.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   You're done."
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   Problem solved.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   You're going to worry about this for three or four months.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   Nope.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   Here we go.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   Check.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   Don.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.280]   I'm going to interview Adam Lachinsky did in Fortune Magazine talking about Tim's unique
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:56.800]   style and how he has in fact done very well.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.600]   It's silly me, but I liken it to Joe Montana and Steve Young.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.680]   As a 49ers fan, there was no greater quarterback than Joe Montana until you look at the numbers
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.640]   and you realize Steve Young was a greater quarterback than Joe Montana.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:19.800]   This is like the successor beating the master.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:27.560]   Stock has gone from a split adjusted $54 to $126 since Jobs died.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   That's a market cap of $700 billion.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.920]   The cash hoard has more than tripled since Steve passed to $150 billion.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.480]   That despite the fact that Apple's already spent almost $100 million in buybacks and
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:47.160]   dividends, something Jobs said we will never do.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:55.240]   $38 billion of merchandise sold in China, a market that was nonexistent when Steve left
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.880]   the company.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.400]   Tim's done a great job.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.240]   What's interesting, he's taken I think Apple into a new area with the watch into fashion.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.400]   We've done for me to be seen.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   We'll see how that works.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.000]   What was the term I was looking at a New York Times style section and what was the term
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.280]   they were using for Apple to Wapple Watch?
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   Norm Core.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   What?
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   Norm Core.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.280]   Norm Core.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   Not NURM Core.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.880]   Nope, Norm Core.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.360]   Meaning that apparently it's all fashionable or the specific type of fashion that Apple
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.200]   Watch will be is not hardcore, not softcore, but norm core.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   Just sort of normal.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   For crying out loud.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.800]   Because everyone can have it and therefore it's not real fashion.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   Born in a Wikipedia, Norm Core is a unisex fashion trend characterized by unpretentious
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.000]   and average looking clothing.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.600]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.400]   New York Times Magazine all over it.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.040]   I know nothing.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   I know Norm Core.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.320]   I reminded that I know absolutely nothing because now there is like what if what these
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.640]   isn't very stylish or fashionable or whatever, there's absolutely no trend represented by
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   this.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   We have to call no trend a trend itself.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   There you go.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   Here you go.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.680]   There's a picture of two people, one man, one woman dressed in Norm Core.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   This is also a Wikipedia.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.320]   I've got a guy dressed all over it.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.800]   No, there's space available for an Apple Watch there.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   Oh, good heavens.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.440]   Well, first of all, you don't button the top button.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440]   That's fine.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.440]   What is that?
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.440]   That's Canadian Norm Core.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.440]   I think he's from Canada.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.560]   I'm just saying it seems as though this writer wanted to say that Apple has come up with
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.640]   a really boring watch design, but they don't want to fend by Apple because they still
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   haven't seen the review hardware yet.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.200]   I want to know who posed for this Norm Core picture.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.000]   Can he like, he's really?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.960]   Yeah, I didn't even know they make those.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.200]   Actually those don't look, they're just acid washed jeans.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.600]   Well, that's bleated.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   So he's okay.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   They're flat front caggies.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Flat front.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.400]   There's something in his pocket though that's really a maybe drawing me eye.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.520]   Maybe he's holding like that dark iPad, but he looks like he's ready to be taken.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.080]   Into the spaceship by his doomsday cult.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.200]   It's the perfectly white sneakers that are the giveaway, isn't it?
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.960]   It's the tapering to the sneakers that really sets that off.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:22.240]   There's something about those legs.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:29.920]   And all they have to do now is just show this picture and say now in three styles.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:39.120]   So I had a request, someone asked about what I use for forwarding slides for presentations.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.160]   And so this is, a lot of people you can go to Radio Shack and buy those little infrared
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.120]   things that only work about half the time.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.080]   And so I thought I'd show the industrial version of that.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.360]   So let me see if I have this new system and try to experiment with just once I guess
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   it's so.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   So this is the company here.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.280]   It's a DCAN and as you can see that they make speaker timers.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.120]   Is this coming from you?
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   This is a screenshot.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.040]   Are you doing, tell us trading?
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   I am.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.720]   God, you're such a show off.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.200]   So anyway, so the.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.880]   This is coming over Skype.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.960]   This looks, I mean, I can't believe this looks better than our screenshots.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.320]   So anyway, so the, so if you, if you look at it now, the queue lights are the what, or
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   what I'm actually using.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.920]   Your cat just give the whole thing up.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.560]   Exactly.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.240]   So the, so anyway, but the cool thing about it, if you look at it actually physically here,
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.640]   this is the, this is kind of the.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   Oh my God.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   So you're just trying to show up.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.800]   Creme Cam 3000, the future of this is, this is the new, this is the new cam.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.160]   So, because, because, so this is the, this is the controller.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.480]   Now this will go about 300 feet without really any trouble at all.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.360]   And it's very simple to use.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.320]   You can even get one that doesn't have a back to really protect speakers from themselves.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.840]   So now the problem with it is, is that, you know, that you don't give them a lot of control.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:08.520]   And so instead of having them go directly to the computer, you actually go to this.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.600]   So, so this here is, if you look at this, what you have is you can decide that it's a
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.640]   master or slave.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   That means it could follow another one.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.680]   You know, so you could actually put these together to run a bunch of computers at one
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   time.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   You can give it sound.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.480]   So I turn the sound up like this, you'll see it and watch, see the little, I don't know
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.440]   if you can hear that or not through my, my thing, but, but basically what that's designed
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:38.160]   for is if you, if, if you want someone to go forward, you can actually have them do
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.640]   that without having the person who's up stage actually run their own presentation, which
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   is very useful.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.680]   And of course you can turn this light up and down.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.720]   And so you can see that it's USB and you can actually connect this to two computers at
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   one time.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.320]   So, and the reason that that's useful is the, obviously what happens a lot of times in
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:02.760]   presentations is that, is that you, what happens in the presentations is that you have
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.920]   a primary and a backup presentation that's running to stage so that we can switch back
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.720]   and forth with one of them crashes.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200]   So anyway, that's, that's it.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.040]   Do you like my little system, Leo?
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.520]   What are you doing with it?
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   What?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.000]   What are you doing there?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.400]   This is how I, oh, what am I doing to do that?
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.640]   Well, I'm impressed because first of all, it's on Skype.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.960]   And it looks like you're, you have better quality than we have in studio.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.920]   So, so that's number one.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.360]   How much bandwidth are you throwing at it?
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.480]   Well, I have the, so my office has about 300 down and 100 out.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.040]   So it's, it's, it's, um, you hear the explains.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   So that's interesting.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.000]   So Skype will use, I mean, there must be a limit to how much Skype will use.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.640]   But it's using enough to give us beautiful images.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.600]   Now the other thing is is that this is the new Skype TX box.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:00.360]   So this is a straight SDI into a Skype TX, you know, one you, um, so this is the, this
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:06.120]   is a company that Microsoft acquired that was doing this kind of dedicated Skype hardware.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   What is it called?
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   It was called cat and mouse.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Cat and mouse.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.520]   We looked at it was really expensive.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   It is.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:21.080]   It's, you know, it is, um, but, but what my frustration was I was tired of trying to
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:26.040]   emulate a webcam, you know, like like this, this constant process of trying to trick
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.280]   Skype into knowing what, what it was at.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.160]   And I have too many clients and too many other things that wanted to use Skype that I just,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.920]   I needed to have a solution for it.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   And what, what I have here is something that we're working on for classes.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.320]   So this is a, you know, the, I don't see, I wouldn't even need this studio.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.240]   If I had this at the house, you should see the rest of it.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:50.160]   I next week when I'm on out, I'll, I'll, I'll have the other camera system set up.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.560]   It's just not, it just came in in the mail and I'll be able to, I can actually show the
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.240]   system because there's a, it's a, it's a science project right now.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.640]   I have to rewire it because Sam actually, Sam Squires came out and built it.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.760]   And then I tore half of it apart to get this Skype.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.080]   So what do you use for a switcher?
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.520]   I'm using a couple switchers.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:15.840]   So there's a, so there's a, the ATEM, I have a two me in a, in a, in a television studio.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.160]   So these are, and so one of them is just letting me go back and forth between these sources
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   like this.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.600]   And then the other one is once I get to this source, I have another one that is controlled
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   by some control pick.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.400]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I can transition.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.360]   At least we could do that.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   Star web.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   Star web.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   These are, these are three different sources that I can bring in.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.320]   I can't believe how good this, you know how hard it was it to.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.160]   Yeah, you can't do that, can you?
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.200]   No, I can't.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   I can't do that.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   Not yet.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Not yet.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   But now that I've seen it, I don't know.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.160]   We spent, oh yeah, can't do that, can you?
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.840]   We spent so much money at tech TV and so much time and so much effort.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.960]   You remember this shooting screens because there was no, I remember it.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.960]   There was no way.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.440]   And so we actually had a camera operator with the expensive camera pointed at a screen.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.800]   And you have to be very careful about pulling the focus in and out because it would more
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.120]   a like crazy and remember that now you just go like, yeah, well, I push a button here.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.000]   Well, and I can tell straight.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.160]   I don't have, yeah, well, yeah, and that's just, yeah.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.320]   So the, and I can do zoom ins on the screens.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   I just haven't set up.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.720]   I'm just going home right now and I'm going to buy whatever you have.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   And I'm going home.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.160]   We're going to close the studio and I'm just going to go home.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.360]   Alex, be ready, be ready for a package to arrive from Petaluma.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.000]   It's going to be about a sign about this big reading with East.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.160]   I am so impressed.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.840]   That is really amazing what you're doing there.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   That's really great.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840]   That's really great.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   We're just having some fun.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.000]   I'm just teasing it.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   All right.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.800]   We're three out of four wearing the watch.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.520]   The force is sitting in a soundproof booth.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.440]   So he won't be tainted by our opinions.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.200]   I just got a new, I knew Deanna Domra of CD came in just today.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.440]   Oh, listening to it during the conversation.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.320]   I'll say something right up front.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.480]   It is easily the best.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.000]   Now I've worn all the smart watches including the weird galaxy gears and all the different
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   watches.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And of course I'm a fan of Android Wear and I've been wearing quite a bit.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.560]   I'll say something right up front.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.720]   In terms of looks, it's great.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.960]   I've asked a number of people.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.480]   Some people say, yeah, it still looks kind of geeky.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.880]   But I think it looks great.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.240]   I like the Milanese loop, but there are lots of different kinds of bands.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.400]   And the other thing in display may confirm this today, but I've been thinking this all
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   long.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.880]   It is a great display.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.360]   This is Apple's first OLED display.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.460]   All the Android Wear watches are LCD, I believe, IPS LCD.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.280]   There are some Samsung OLED displays.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.360]   I think many of the Samsung watches use OLED, but OLED has some real advantages.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.720]   First of all, incredible contrast.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.040]   The blacks are in key black.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.760]   The whites are white, white, white.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.640]   And that also saves power because only the lighter dots need to be powered.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.040]   You don't need a backlight for the whole thing as you do on LCD.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.440]   You could just light the part of the screen that's being used.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.120]   But it also gives you an incredible looking high-res display.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.360]   It's over 300 dots per inch.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.160]   I did not know that, but they broke out the calipers at display mate.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.680]   Even the 38 millimeter is over 300 dots per inch.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.960]   I think we're close to maybe 277.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.520]   It's pretty good.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.200]   Just from cosmetics, just looking on the outside, not at the software, but just at the outside,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.440]   I think it's a good-looking watch with a very nice-looking screen.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.280]   Adam, what do you think?
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.680]   Yeah, I agree with that a lot.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:44.000]   I was really actually impressed the Flora Alastomer band.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.600]   You like the rubber band.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.000]   Well, how comfortable it is.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.760]   Yeah, I wore a pebble for the past, I think, over a year.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.400]   And so I'm moving from the pebble to this, and I've been very impressed just with the
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.560]   wearability of it.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.000]   I want to ultimately get a band.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.840]   I just didn't want to pay the Apple tax on some of the bands.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.720]   You think there'll be third-party bands?
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   I guess it's a standard.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   There's going to be a ton.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.000]   And there were some rumors that Apple was going to have a certification program even.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.200]   So I'm looking forward.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.400]   I want to get something improbable in leather.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.400]   It'd be nice to have a couple different options, but my budget doesn't allow for $150 classic
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   buckle band.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.680]   Those are beautiful, though, aren't they?
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   All the bands are very nice.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.000]   Like I said, it is technically, I guess, rubber.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.520]   But whatever the material is, doesn't feel like any other rubber strap that I've ever
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.000]   worn on a sports watch or a swatch.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.280]   I mean, it's really soft and supple and very, very comfortable to wear a Harley-E.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   Why did you get to 38?
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.480]   I was going for the 42.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.720]   That's why I'm wearing the 38.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.920]   Well, in my house--
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.720]   It's my wife's.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.600]   We do some past down of technology.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.040]   And so my wife didn't want one day one.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.880]   But when I asked her last minute, do you think you'd ever want it?
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.280]   And then we started talking about some of the features.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.960]   She said, you know, I may.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.280]   So I went with the 38 because she did really didn't have any interest in the 42.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.960]   And I know I'll be upgrading whenever the next one comes out.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   Same with me.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.440]   Same up to the 42 then.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.840]   And I want to be able to send Lisa my heartbeat and all that stuff.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   All right.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.760]   You know, that's another one of those features that I thought right out of the gate.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.960]   How come on, you know, this is not going to be a thing.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.080]   But, you know, it's actually kind of an interesting--
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.320]   Have you been able to send touches and heartbeats to people yet?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.760]   Yeah, my brother.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.080]   Yeah, isn't that sweet?
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.280]   I mean, I like them a lot.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.160]   But I'm sending them to a stranger.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.680]   The only other person I know with an Apple Watch is some guy that we've emailed.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   I don't even know who it was at first.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.920]   See, I'm sending a heartbeat right now.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.000]   It's a brilliant plan to breed the next generation of Apple fans will buy anything.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.840]   Because the only one you can send your heartbeat of love to are other people who bought an Apple Watch
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.080]   at 30 seconds past midnight.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   That's exactly right.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   That's exactly right.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.040]   In fact, Lisa, I can't send her one yet.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   She's letting me wear her watch.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.200]   She doesn't have one yet until I get mine, which is in a couple of weeks.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.920]   So I'm sending heartbeats to strangers, drawing little pictures.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.040]   Look, he's drawing me a picture now.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.880]   Real quickly, I'm curious on the size.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.760]   You know, I've been wearing that pedal, which I think is about 50 millimeters.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.360]   I mean, it's pretty big.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.000]   Same thing with the Android Wear is much bigger.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.680]   Yeah, when I went to do my try-on, you know, I got to try on both.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   And I was pretty worried and disappointed because I was like, oh, I think I really wanted
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.800]   the 42.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.600]   But I think a lot of that too was just having the two sort of side by side and having the
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.600]   comparison.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.080]   Because now after wearing this, I mean, it feels fine.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.680]   I think I still want the slightly larger just for me.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.600]   But it doesn't feel like a compromise.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.800]   Like, this is what I was worried it was going to feel like I had really compromised on the
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   screen.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.720]   I'm not feeling that way after having worn it for a few days now.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.520]   Can I make one point that I actually had to take a picture of when I bought this watch
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.760]   like five or six years ago, I was waffling on this a lot because it is larger than any
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.920]   other watch I've ever bought.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.360]   I used to have like a time X that was probably 38 or a little bit smaller than that.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.760]   And so this even this seemed like it was going to be an enormous watch.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.400]   But after about two or three days of wearing, I realized that it wasn't a big watch.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.040]   It was just bigger than what I was used to.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.920]   So if you're people who are trying to decide between 38 and 42 and they think that G, I
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.640]   think the 42 is going to be a lot more readable, but I'm kind of thrown off by how big it is.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.440]   Consider the size of the watch you're wearing right now or the fact that you don't wear
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.120]   watch and that might help you to decide.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.200]   I want to thank Stephen Hall who's been sending me heartbeats and drawings and stuff so I
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   could demo.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.840]   So Leo, of all the things that people have been sketching to you, how many of them are
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   non-broadcastable?
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   Or what's in writing?
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.640]   Do people just do people just two pictures of kitty cats?
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.800]   It's not that big.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.000]   You really can't draw any genitalia.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Oh yes, you can.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Yes, you can.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   So many genitalia.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Okay.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.800]   Five dollar donation to the World Wildlife Fund every time.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.200]   Okay, I'm going to give you all a chance to yell at me now because I'm going to tell
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.080]   you what I think about the guts, the insides.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.960]   I mean, it's beautiful and I'll acknowledge that as a great screen.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.200]   Having worn, and I'm curious what you guys have to say, having worn smart watches now
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.920]   for more than a year.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   This doesn't seem groundbreaking.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.400]   In fact, in some ways, like the heartbeat and the drawings, that is not a selling point,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.960]   frankly, for me.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   No.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.560]   I think it's a little busier than it ought to be.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:40.480]   There's a lot of manipulation and fiddling to get it to do things.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.680]   And I just feel like it's not a breakthrough in the sense that it's in a particular regard
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.920]   better than Android Wear or the watches that have been out there.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.760]   I think the screen is better than the Android Wear screens.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.520]   It's nice to be able to take and make phone calls, but it's not something probably I will
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.640]   do a lot of.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.040]   I don't find it particularly impressive.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.640]   It's not bad.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.360]   If you want a smart watch, it's a good choice among all the smart watches, but I think most
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.600]   people will not find this of great utility.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.120]   I think a lot of people just don't feel bad.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.000]   In other words, I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.080]   If you didn't get one or you don't want one or you can't afford one because I don't feel
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   you're missing a lot of functionality.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   Agreed?
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.080]   Disagree?
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   Go ahead.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   Adam, fight me.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   Beat me up on this.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   I think it has a lot more functionality than my pebble did.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.920]   I have not worn an Android Wear, so I can't really compare to that sort of thing.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.200]   Let me say this, no watch that works with Apple is going to do as well as this because
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.040]   Apple just locks everything down.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.840]   Only Apple really has access to all the features of the phone.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:52.800]   Android Wear with Android, I think, gives you as much functionality, almost as much,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   in some cases not.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.600]   You can't send a heartbeat.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.400]   I think some of it too, though, is early stage and functionality.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.720]   I definitely feel like there's some bugs.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.640]   There's some things that Apple will be able to tweak, maybe in the software in the UI.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.720]   I'm not super happy with how I can navigate through glances.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   This is insane.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Come on.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.600]   You have way more apps installed.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.960]   I think that's another thing is I think pairing down the number of apps that you're interacting
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.560]   with to really those ones that are essential, that really helps a lot.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:30.400]   I think some of it is tailoring the watch to what you need it to do.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.760]   I've certainly done that with glances because you can have so many glances.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.680]   The problem with glances is they're individual pages and you have to find what you're...
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.400]   There's no quick way to go to a glance that you want.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.200]   You have to swipe through them.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.360]   Yeah, I hope they can tweak that.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.560]   You can go into the settings and you can move them or change the order around and prioritize
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   them.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.520]   Maybe the ones you accessed most frequently are closer to one end or the other end.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   I found that a little bit tricky to navigate.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.600]   I mean, these are things that can really be overcome as far as the day-to-day utility
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.200]   and functionality of it.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:13.880]   I'm finding as days go on, it's slowly integrating its way into more and more parts of my day.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.800]   I think for somebody who works out, there's some real advantages to it.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:22.600]   Let me see if I can manage to navigate to the workout program.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.760]   I was going to say that the workout stuff for me has been...
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.920]   I was using the Misfit app on my Pebble, which is really nice.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.720]   Yeah, but again, this is a lot nicer and tracking those.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.920]   I'm not so sure about the awards that they give out.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.560]   I haven't quite figured those out yet.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.120]   Yeah, they're little weird, little 3D things.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.360]   The first one I got was looked like a target, but there was no words.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.880]   There was no congratulations.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.160]   It was just like the spinning, I guess, metal.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.520]   Yeah, it's a little funky.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.280]   So here's an outdoor cycle.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   Somebody's tapping me.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.760]   This is another issue.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.280]   Also, do you find it slow to launch things?
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.080]   I spend a lot of time watching it.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.160]   They still need to tweak the software a little bit.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.760]   I've had some hang-ups and crashes, most specifically with some of the Siri functionality, where
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.320]   it'll just go dead for several seconds.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   I actually had to reset the watch because it was stopped doing my heart rate for three
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   days.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.040]   Yeah, this is all early stage stuff.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.720]   Version 1, it's really, really good.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.120]   I don't want to focus too much on the negatives because I'm pretty positive about it so far.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.960]   Well, and the main reason is I think that I want to make sure people don't feel any FOMO
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.000]   or need to rush out and get one.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.440]   And the thing that I've been saying is that I don't think it's going to take us all about
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.480]   a month or a month and a half to really come up with longstanding opinions on Apple Watch
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.800]   because developers have not figured out how to write apps for it yet.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.560]   And now they see it in the flesh.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.200]   They know how to adapt their apps to make it more relevant.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.280]   People have never, most of the people who are buying this have never worn a smart watch
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.400]   before so they're not used to how to integrate that into your lives.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   Right.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.640]   There are a lot of things that really, so a lot of first impressions are going to be
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.880]   valid as first impressions, but maybe if you circle back to those people in a month and
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.560]   ask them the same questions, again, they'll have very different answers.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.160]   I think that estimation of Apple Watch is probably going to go up a little bit as people
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.440]   as users and developers figure this out.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.840]   Johnny Ive kicked upstairs.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.880]   Chief design officer.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.520]   The announcement was, I think, originally made by Stephen Fry.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.600]   And an interesting but quite discursive article on the telegraph.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:39.760]   And then a memo came out from Tim Cook confirming that.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.640]   Johnny Ive is now a chief design officer.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   Not sure how that...
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.240]   Well, I guess he doesn't do hands-on.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.840]   Because of his managerial duties.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.120]   That's all the stuff that I've read indicates that it's more of a...
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.080]   Now he can just be this free floating cloud of design that descends...
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.520]   That floats over the entire planet of Apple stuff, including retail, and just simply descends
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.600]   to rain design upon something and doesn't have to like, "Oh, and now we need some...
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.360]   Someone needs their 1099s, countersign.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.520]   Yeah, there's other people who can do that now.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.000]   It's just basically how many times should the fork and the new Apple cafeteria on the spaceship
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.880]   campus be right now?"
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.960]   There was like three really different reactions.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.640]   One from the people who were optimistic was, "Wow, he's finally ascending.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.120]   He's shedding all those managerial duties he doesn't like, and he can focus entirely
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.280]   on design."
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.840]   The pessimists were like, "Well, this is his first foot out of the door.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.760]   He's giving over his responsibilities.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.160]   He's not going to be at Apple forever."
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.000]   And then the analysts were like, "Oh, super clever way for Apple to hide his salary because
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.400]   he has no management duties and not a policy maker.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.640]   He says, 'No disclosure, he needed under FCC guidelines.'"
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.520]   Oh, that's an interesting twist on all of that.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   Richard, what was his...
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.760]   Do you know what his salary is until July 1st?
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.200]   They haven't reported it since 2009, even though it looks like they should have because
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.560]   he had managerial duties when he was promoted to senior vice president.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.560]   And I forget what it was.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.200]   It was one of the people on Forbes was saying that there was probably negotiation going
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.640]   back and forth with the FCC saying...
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   SCC.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   SCC.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   SCC, yeah.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.120]   So, he was saying that, "Well, you have him on your corporate front page and that's not
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.720]   matching your disclosure statements and he does have all these direct reports and that's
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.040]   not matched and that is a policy making job and maybe they decided to move him out before
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   that became an issue."
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   Why hide it?
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.480]   Is it because it's like $40 million?
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   It's competitive information.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.800]   They said it's like the highest paid trader at a hedge fund.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.920]   He's not an officer of the company, but he's one of the most valuable assets of that company.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   You don't need to know what Johnny makes to know that Johnny is critical to Apple.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.640]   He's just as poachable now as ever.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.280]   Yeah, but no one has no good poach him.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.880]   But who could poach him, right, Mike?
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.320]   I don't think it's the name of money.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.000]   The guy probably owns quite a chunk of stock in Apple, so the money is just going to build
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   forever.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.920]   But there has to be a reason that he would want to join your company and as a designer,
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.760]   what better job is there than his?
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.320]   Isn't he or Lego?
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.320]   I've heard some interesting...
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   Lego!
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   I don't see Johnny.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.840]   Oh, that's the ultimate thing.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.720]   You talk about quick turnaround prototyping.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.120]   There's Lego and there's nothing else.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.760]   The thinnest bricks we've ever made.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.320]   Richard Halworth or Halworth will become VP of Industrial Design.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   That means he's hardware design.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.440]   He's part of the original iPhone team.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.480]   Alan, this concerns me a little bit more.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.280]   First of all, I was concerned when they say Johnny was in charge of software.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.720]   That worried me a little bit.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.920]   Alan Dye is now going to be VP User Interface Design.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.640]   That's both desktop and mobile devices.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   That's software.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.360]   He's the guy who did the fabulous Apple Watch UI.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.760]   He was bought over from marketing, which is why there was all that hubbub at the time
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.400]   about marketing taking over.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.800]   But he was doing marketing design at Apple and he moved over.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.720]   Greg Christie was a long time head of design at Apple and he started phasing himself out.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.800]   He was more of the Steve Jobs, Sumorific, era, and originally pioneered the iPhone interface
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   and all those things.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.600]   Christie and Bazz, I'm beginning his last name early, started winding down.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.080]   Alan Dye started moving in and he was working with Johnny on this new flatter, simpler,
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.320]   more retina and lead design.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   A lot against that.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.960]   I think that's all good.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.520]   Do you think that the, maybe it's just me.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.560]   Do you think the Apple Watch is a paragon of incredible software UI design?
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.560]   It's an experiment.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.120]   I would say it's a playground right now.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.080]   Well, it's for $400 minimum, it shouldn't be a playground.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:34.360]   But it's interesting to look at some of the history behind these guys.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.280]   Alan started off in fashion design.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.720]   He was, I forget what Brandon was for, but he was a high-end sort of accessories maker.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.280]   He started at Apple in 2007 and he was working exclusively pretty much on iTunes and the
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280]   iPod.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:56.960]   So, if you're getting started on the iPod in 2007, you're definitely being slotted in
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.280]   on the top products for it to start off with.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.120]   Well, he did the box for the...
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.400]   Yeah, well, let's be clear.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.560]   He did the box.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.200]   But I, you know, in every single unboxing video I've done, most of them are tongue-in-cheek.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   It's a good box.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.440]   Because I think boxing videos are ridiculous.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:21.200]   But every time you look at the packaging that anything that Apple makes comes in, here
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.720]   is the box for Apple Watch.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.520]   And the corners are completely sharp.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.840]   You can't, every time I open up a box, it's like, look how tightly this is fitted and
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:38.000]   how long it takes to get gravity to simply drop the thing off of the container.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   This is just beautiful.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.320]   I'm really not a fan of the Apple Take Shore that the other side of the fence is painted
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.440]   just as well as, I'm not a fan of that statement, but their time's received, man, they put
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.840]   so much work and effort into just how nicely this box is going to be, given that it's going
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:58.360]   to be your first introduction to this thing you've just paid a lot of money for.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:05.960]   By the way, Andy just sent me a link to a original packaging box only eBay listing,
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.320]   50 bucks.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.920]   I just threw out 100 bucks worth of boxes.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.600]   You had the, you had the, you had the, you had the, you had the stainless steel one,
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   we lost quite 200 bucks.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.720]   Is it too like to recall the recycling bin?
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.240]   There hasn't, there hasn't been any bids on that one, but I'm continuing to like do searches.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.160]   And here's one that there's already four bids up to 10 bucks.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.640]   Here's another one with the box.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   It's free.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   People are fans.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   People are fans.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   Apple.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.280]   I should have wrapped them up and given the empty boxes to my kids for Christmas.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.080]   The one thing you can definitely say you will def unlike the, unlike the contents, you will
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.520]   definitely be able to use that box in two years.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.840]   So maybe it's the better value.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   All right.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.760]   Time to talk music.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.080]   A challenging world.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.520]   Let me set the stage here because Apple is the number one retailer of music, iTunes and
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.680]   digital downloads at iTunes dominate the industry entirely.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.240]   But the world is changing.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.760]   People have been moving a hundred million people listen to Pandora, 60 million people
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.560]   listen to Spotify.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:10.680]   And you're seeing dramatic, almost precipitous drops in record sales over the last few years.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.520]   Apple obviously recognizes they've got to do something.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.040]   They buy Beats with Beats streaming service, which on its own was not wildly successful.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.200]   Around 110,000 subscribers when they bought it, compare that to 100 million or 60 million.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:29.000]   You get an idea that Beats was a late to the party and perhaps not the strongest.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.440]   But I think they also felt good about getting Dr. Dre, getting Jimmy Iveen and maybe even
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   more importantly getting Trent Reznor and designing something that they could.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:46.760]   Is it replace, you feel like it's replace iTunes and purchases with, that this is, I
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.400]   feel like people don't buy music much anymore.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.240]   I think they're live, some people do and some people don't.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.800]   So Steve Jobs always said people want to own music.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.160]   Well, some people do and some people don't.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.320]   And I think what Apple's trying to do is have it both ways.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.200]   You can buy music from them, you can stream all your music.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.120]   It also integrates essentially the features of iTunes match.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.760]   So if you have music that's not on their service, it'll get added and then you'll have
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.400]   access to it too.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.680]   I wasn't clear at the presentation, but they do say that on the web page.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.120]   Right, that is interesting.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.080]   That is what Google does now with its all access music and Amazon does with its music.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.400]   It allows you to upload and iTunes match does.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   But now they allow you to upload and stream via their new music service.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.080]   Yeah, so that way if you take it.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   That's a competitive advantage.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.640]   Taylor Swift weren't on this service and maybe she will be, but she's not on the others.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.960]   And you buy her album, it would just be integrated with all the other music.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.160]   I use the Beatles as an example.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.840]   The only way you're going to get Beatles on a streaming music service.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.760]   Right, is that you bought them on CD or on iTunes and they will just show up.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.000]   But otherwise, I think Beats Music is a good service.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   I love how they spent time talking about the thing I liked from their music presentation
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   is they talked about curation.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.280]   They talked about using human beings to pick playlists and it's people who understand music
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.480]   who are trying to go beyond the algorithm.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.440]   And Beats as a music service was really good is until the end of the month.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   That was its thing that it was good at that.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   That was its thing.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.120]   Jimmy Iovine stepped forward before when they founded Beats and said, "We believe we want
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.920]   to bring the human back in and the music."
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.600]   So I think it's a good service.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.720]   It was late to the party and hasn't really caught on.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:20.520]   But I think Apple is also hobbled by its association with AT&T.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.200]   Yeah, I think it's a smart move.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.600]   It was a smart move for Apple to take it.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.320]   I think rebranding it is just fine.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.840]   But I think that they're inheriting some of the good features.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.600]   Like the sentences call it.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.720]   I'm hanging with my keynote buddies waiting for a unique book.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:43.480]   They're also taking away the Beats Android app and they won't have Android till the fall.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   That's a big audience.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.640]   It's like not having a Windows app.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.440]   They will have a Windows app in the fall as well.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.720]   Well, they take it away or will they just leave it there?
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   We don't know.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.720]   Maybe they'll leave it there.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.160]   I have to feel it's going to be a compatible service.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:59.160]   When this launches in 8.4 at the end of the month, June 30th, I have to feel like the
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.480]   old Beats is going to just say, "Okay, switch over.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.480]   Bye.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.480]   It could be."
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.240]   And for Android users, that's going to be, "Okay, bye bye."
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   That's what they're doing then.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.360]   Well, and for the Android app is also hobbled in that there's no free access.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.880]   If you are, you can only get the, so there's a number of features that if you're using
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.960]   it on iOS or on your Mac, you can get for free.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.520]   You can listen to Beats 1.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.080]   You can get some of the streaming the radio stations with limited skips.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.880]   But that's not available as a tier for Android.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.000]   You have to be a paid subscriber to get anything.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.480]   You know, I'd surprise me that Beats 1 was free because that was another differentiator
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   is we're going to have a 24/7 global radio station with three of the best known disc
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.360]   jockeys in the world who I had never heard of.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.040]   And that was a differentiator, but that's for you get every Apple user gets that.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.000]   Well, but that's a great way to sell music and to get people into the service, right?
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.280]   That's a great way to say, "Look, we're giving away all this music for free.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.600]   We've got people who are choosing it.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   We really want to appeal."
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.760]   Well, I get it both because I'll subscribe to Spotify for the same price, 10 bucks a
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   month.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   And I get Beats 1 radio.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   Sure.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   And the price is amazing, right?
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   15 bucks.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.800]   15 bucks a month.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   That's what's really mean.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.800]   You're willing to use iCloud family sharing.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.280]   I had some people have had up to that.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   Oh, you have to use family sharing to do that?
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   It's hard to get that.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   It's hard to get that.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   Do your family sharing.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   Ooh.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.720]   I had heard that the Verge said that Spotify was going to respond to that with a similar
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   price.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   There was some rumor that.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   I don't see an announcement.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   I don't think they've done that.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.920]   That happens when you've got deals with labels, right?
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.040]   Is that you go back to them and say, "Cut us that same deal for family."
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.880]   And the tip for tap, by the way, was they know free tier.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.600]   I mean, that's what the labels didn't like.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.080]   That's what Taylor Swift didn't like.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.680]   This is the free tier of Spotify and Pandora and all these others.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   Well, that's very Apple.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   And Apple's not going to do that.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   Right.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.680]   That's very Apple to just say, "Look, pay us."
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.240]   That's what we're here for as you pay us money.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   There will be some free stuff.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.240]   You said radio one is free.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240]   Beats one is free.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.720]   Some stuff that you-- iTunes radio is not going away.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.080]   There are still going to be curated stations and you will be able to listen to them for
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   free with limited skips much as you can now on iTunes radio.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.560]   So they do have a free tier, really.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.640]   There is some free stuff, but it's less control, right?
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.560]   You can't just go and play any song, I think.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   Well, Pandora is like that.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   Right.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   Closer to Pandora than Spotify.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.200]   Not Spotify, yeah.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.400]   Yeah, I found that really confusing.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:14.040]   I mean, I was expecting to see one just sort of tight ball of music features, but now I'm
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.560]   thinking, "Okay, so I've got the radio station, plus I've got iTunes match, plus I've got
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.960]   Apple radio, plus I've got curated playlists from other people, plus I've got a social
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.120]   media platform."
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.120]   I mean, it just really just seems--
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.720]   If I understand what Apple's going for, I really think that they don't want to leave
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.920]   anything behind on the plate.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.440]   They want to-- if there is a way that somebody is experiencing music, they want to have a
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:39.600]   product that will work with whatever you're going to do because they don't want people
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:43.800]   to leave the Apple ecosystem in order to get internet radio, or they don't want to-- they
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.320]   like everything except for a curated playlist, and they're going to still be dipping into
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.560]   Spotify for curated playlists.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.000]   But it made it really, really difficult to follow the story that they were trying to tell
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.360]   yesterday.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.400]   And it's really-- to all that I was hearing was, "Okay, we've got that feature from Star
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.280]   of Spotify, and now we've got this feature from this other service you're familiar with."
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.240]   So just-- I don't know what to think.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.800]   It just seems like-- the note that I was-- the note that I have in front of me taken at the
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.320]   time was that, "Okay, you've given me a lot of reasons why this new music system is great
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   for Apple.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.960]   I don't think you've given me a reason why it's going to be great for me the customer."
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.560]   Well, I think the service could be good, although getting all that stuff in a single
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   app is going to be really hard.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   I think there's no questions.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.680]   Anybody seen the app?
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.600]   They showed the music app on iOS.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   They have not shown it.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.240]   So will you integrate iTunes on Mac?
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.360]   iTunes on Mac, which is already kind of a--
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.520]   I gave me great hope.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.040]   My heart started pounding a little bit when they showed what looked like a very different
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.200]   iTunes on the screen, and then they did say anything more.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.320]   But do you think they've rewritten iTunes?
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   I sure hope so.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   I hope so.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.360]   But this newest version isn't even that old, so it's unclear whether they're ready to throw
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   that all out already.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   I think iTunes is gradually becoming an operating system.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   It's the e-max.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.360]   It's the e-max.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   It's the music player.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   You'll be able to get mail from it.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.920]   But Amazon is absolutely right.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.520]   They didn't make the case.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.880]   That's one of my great faults with that section of the keynote is not only is it long and
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:09.840]   boring and overstuffed and self-indulgent and very not Apple keynote, but they have
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.800]   a very interesting, complicated service that they need to make the case for.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   Instead, it was sort of like, "Here's Drake.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.760]   He'll tell you some stories."
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.360]   And they didn't make the case that they needed to make.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   Story time with Drake.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   I want to blame Drake.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   I thought he was very well-spoken.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.760]   I liked how natural he was.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.440]   He's very good on stage, but he didn't have what he was doing made no sense.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.520]   His lead-in was for something that he didn't talk about.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.120]   And he was in the middle of kind of a disaster of a presentation.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.680]   Yeah, I thought he had dignity and told an interesting story, but it wasn't what out.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.160]   It didn't serve Apple's needs.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.640]   They didn't set him up properly, so it made him look like he was off the reservation a
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.200]   little bit, which is bad for him.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.440]   So yeah, it was a mess.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.200]   It's a shame because this is Andy's right.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.280]   This is a complicated service.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.680]   They really need to explain how iTunes and this service and the streaming and the radio
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.640]   all work together.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.120]   And they didn't.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.720]   And everybody came out going, "I don't understand what this product is."
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   And that's failure.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   To set the story, Drake.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   Who, by the way, we all want his jacket.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Love the jacket.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.200]   Yeah, we all want his rainbow Apple.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   No, he's really likable.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   Yeah, he was.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   It was not his fault that he was in the middle of-
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.960]   Just was off message, I guess.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   But you know, when you-
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.960]   But you know, when you-
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   Even Jimmie, Jimmie Iaveen was not really on message.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   No.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   He was on something.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   He was on something.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   What a strange story.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.200]   I feel like there's so much more to this story than they're telling us.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   Don't you?
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:40.760]   Taylor Swift on Sunday posted a blog post.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.800]   We talked a lot about it on This Week in Tech.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.680]   Two Apple love Taylor.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.760]   And like five minutes later, Eddie Hughes, the post was to please Apple.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.600]   I'm not going to put my music on your new music service because you shouldn't be doing
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.080]   three months free and not pay anybody for the three months free, which was apparently,
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.000]   I guess, Apple's plan.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.080]   Others had protested Adele's label and Indi label and Britain had protested.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:17.480]   But when Taylor does it, man, those Swifties within about, I don't know, a couple of hours,
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.320]   Eddie Hughes was on the phone to Taylor apparently.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.120]   He said he'd been talking to her.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.880]   And then later that night, he tweeted, "Okay, okay.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880]   We'll pay."
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.200]   Well, now that story on recode says, "We'll pay Taylor Swift, but I presume he needs
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   we'll pay everybody."
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.440]   It's fine that it kept saying artists in the discussion as though artists were the-
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.040]   Because these deals, it wasn't that Apple wasn't going to pay us.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.680]   They'd come to deals with record labels saying that they wouldn't be paying for the first
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   three months.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.680]   And while the discussion was focused on artists, you've got to imagine they're not paying artists.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.120]   And in large person, they are paying record labels and the artists will get whatever their
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   deals state those-
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.440]   Yes, see, that's what pisses me off because really, Taylor, you know better than that.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.920]   It's your freaking label.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.520]   Well, it does trickle down to the-
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   I mean, you know, not getting paid.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.440]   Yeah, but who made that deal?
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   The labels.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.880]   Their label made that deal.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.280]   And this is not a minor offer from Apple.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.280]   We want to make sure people get what the numbers-
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280]   Yes.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   How much is that going to be?
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.280]   Do we know?
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   Well, I can- If the- by my calculation and I'm, you know, what I'm looking at is Apple
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.960]   said they're trying to hit 100 million.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960]   Let's just say they do.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.400]   They're going to put- they're going to do a big push for that first three months.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.480]   And they actually get 100 million people and they actually, you know, don't pay $10 a month.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.400]   And they actually would have paid 70%.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.120]   That's like over $2 billion.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.360]   That's a big chunk of what they paid for beats.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.000]   Yeah, but 100 million is ridiculously optimistic.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   You think that's-
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   It's ridiculous.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.760]   Also, they're not paying full rate for the- like they're going to play what they call
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.000]   streaming prices for- before you subscribe, when you subscribe, revenue share kicks in.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.040]   But the free listeners are going to get what they call a streaming fee and nobody seems
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040]   to know what that means.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.640]   But it could be in the tens, if not high tens, if not maybe triple-
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   Well, here's the deal.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:06.320]   You know that Spotify says they've paid 3 billion total over the entire life of Spotify
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.880]   to the labels.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.760]   Tim Westergren at Pandora, what did he say?
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.480]   $1 billion last year.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   Those are both- I mean-
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   What?
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.560]   That's 75 million free streamers on Spotify.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.280]   That's 100 million streamers on Pandora.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.840]   So it's a billion.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840]   Let's say it's a billion.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.480]   Well, and the thing is that now if the record companies are smart, they are going to promote
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.840]   the heck out of it.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:38.160]   And this is why my conspiracy theory hat goes on, is that if the record- after all this
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.120]   PR, if the record companies are smart, they're going to push everybody to Apple Music because
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.920]   there is no cost for the listener to jump in for three months and they get money out of
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   it.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.040]   Like this is the- the record companies right now can print money from this now.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.160]   So are you thinking that these can play all along-
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.280]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.600]   It's like the old saying, but the executive was responsible for New Coke asking, "Hey,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.400]   is this just a PR campaign to promote Coke?"
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.880]   And he said, "We're not that smart.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.360]   We're not that stupid either."
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.120]   I do believe that the speed at which this decision came in close to, at least close to
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.840]   Taylor Swift post, I think that that does underscore that this whole question about,
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.800]   are we going to pay out money for the first three months of users?
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   That inside of Apple, I believe that that was a very, very hotly argued topic, that
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.080]   wasn't a decision that was made on universal contentions, consensus, and that at the- I
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.200]   believe that at the end that decision was made, say, "Look, we got to make this decision.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.800]   Let's just go this way and whatever happens happens."
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.640]   I do think that even after the announcement was made, it could have tipped one way or
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   another.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.720]   And I believe that Apple deciding that given that there were pros and cons of each way,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.800]   there are advocates at the top for either direction, they said that if we- if we cave
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:01.280]   in right now, when we have this incredibly critical launch in less than a week from now,
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.920]   this will not be the discussion about whether or not we're screwing over independent artists
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.880]   will be a discussion about Apple music.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   And that's what I think happened.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.680]   Yeah, it's good for Apple music.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.360]   I mean, it's costly, but potentially costly.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.600]   Yeah, they've already spent a lot of money on beats.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.080]   They're already spending a lot of money down the path.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.960]   They can afford to do this.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.000]   And here's the thing is that if the music industry figures out that they can just cash
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.640]   in on this, and if the artist all push it and everyone pushes it, Apple could end up
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.680]   paying out more money in the first three months than Spotify paid its entire history.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   True.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.520]   And that is a PR bundle for Apple that is worth the money.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520]   Probably is.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520]   They're spending on that.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.320]   Yeah, if a hundred million people line up, that's good.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.840]   They really are consistently trying to fight the idea that a free service is a business
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.080]   that any real business is going to get into.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.080]   It should be instead, though, that Spotify does pay out their artists even on behalf
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.800]   of people who are using the free layer.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:01.160]   The difference is that they're not getting, essentially, they get credit for ad revenue
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.400]   that is sold to these free listeners.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.800]   And that is added to the main pile of money that's coming in from per play clicks from
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.200]   the rest of the service.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.600]   So it's Apple was on thin ice here.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:18.080]   And another part of the problem was that, and this is probably unfair, but humanity is
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   not fair.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:25.600]   When the one the most widely quoted figures about Apple is how many, how close to $200
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.720]   billion in actual workable money that they have on hand, it's hard for them to that.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.240]   It comes harder for them to explain.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:37.240]   Here's why we don't feel like paying out money for the three months worth of content
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.160]   that we're actually using.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.480]   That's again, it's an emotional argument that people are making against Apple, but it can
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   be an effective one.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.160]   And it might be one that Apple said, if we write a check, this goes away.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.640]   Let's just write the check and make it go away.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.240]   Just to add to what Andy was saying, I heard the same thing that it was highly contentious,
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.320]   you know, at the top levels and that people were arguing about it, even up to the last
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.040]   minute when he was making his tweets.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.960]   And that, but it's also important to understand this shows us several things.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.520]   Apple music is incredibly important.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.800]   Apple is a company.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   It's not just a product that they want to use to sell iPhones.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.760]   You can witness that by seeing the Android app is coming for it.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.080]   Apple music is a big deal and people care about it at the very highest level of Apple,
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.800]   which is probably why you get the senior vice president of iTunes, sort of internet services
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.000]   on Twitter at that late at night on a Sunday.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.800]   But also it's, it is a discussion.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.840]   It's not like evil people versus good people.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.840]   There are people who think that maybe if Apple throws their money at this, and Apple
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.600]   really does believe down to their core that they need three months, they were willing
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.040]   to sacrifice a lot of things to get this three month trial, but that if they just throw
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   money at it, they might get a little like government oversight the way they got it with
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.600]   e-books or the way they've, they're already being looked at by states attorneys general
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   for music.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.320]   Sometimes when Apple feels that money alone can't solve a problem, that whether you believe
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.200]   that the DOJ lawsuit over e-books was prompted or not, or whether you think that states attorneys
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.360]   general should already be looking at Apple music or not, they have that fear in them
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.600]   now that just, that just money makes them a target for things.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.000]   So it's not always a cut and dry.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.880]   Just throw our money at it either.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.880]   It's interesting.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:08.040]   Taylor obviously would make a great diplomat because even from the title of the post on
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.960]   right through it, it's all about, I love you Apple, you're great, you're ingenious, you're
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.400]   innovators, you push the right boundaries.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.840]   It's just this one little thing.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840]   So it was, I almost feel like she kind of knew she'd win this battle and she certainly
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.240]   knew that Apple would still be an important part of her music strategy.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.760]   She also says something very strange.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.800]   She says at the end, we don't ask for free iPhones.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.000]   Please don't ask us to provide you with our music.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.720]   I'm pretty sure Taylor Smith Swift has never paid for an iPhone.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.480]   Then in fact, maybe she doesn't have to ask, but everyone art is in the industry gets free
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   iPhones.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480]   Give me a break.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.760]   Well, I think the label sends a tour, then they charge the target for a time.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   Charge it back.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.480]   But the label is the bad guys here.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:54.440]   And I think this whole discussion really bypasses the real problem here, which is the record
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   labels.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.840]   And the only guy Apple who feels bad about this at this point is the guy who spent eight
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.520]   months of his life negotiating this deal with the record labels, only to see it thrown
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520]   out the window.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.040]   I know there was an accountant at Apple who was going, we're really going to pay for all
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.680]   the iTunes stuff for three months for free on this as well.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.880]   I've got a server I've got.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.480]   I mean, don't you think Apple worked hard to get to the, they're paying 71 and a half
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.760]   percent instead of 70 percent to the record labels.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.760]   That was part of the deal.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.480]   And what we'd like to have this free for three months, don't you think that was a big
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.640]   negotiation they had with the label?
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.520]   And Jimity, what is that?
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.040]   There's a, the lightning storm is right over top of my head right now.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040]   I'm scared.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.760]   I was about to jump out of the table.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.280]   Alex is in the flash right in front of us.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:43.240]   The lightning bolt is, is it was instantaneous to the sound, which means that it must be
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   right here.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   There's flash flood warning.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.240]   You start one Mississippi.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.000]   As long as the server doesn't get, there we go.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Here comes another one.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   Are you in Pittsburgh?
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   Where are you?
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   I am.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   I'm in Pittsburgh.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Yeah, we had a lot of rain here on like California.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.600]   Did you sacrifice to the Thunder God lately?
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   I haven't.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600]   I think I probably should have.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   I think you might.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   It's a little.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.560]   So people are saying Taylor Swift has her own label.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.880]   She has an imprint under a real label.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   Right?
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.480]   I mean, you look at, you, but you look at this letter and it's, it's, well, the difficulty
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.440]   of any, any of us trying to discuss this is that we don't know exactly what's going on
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   behind the scenes.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.240]   We don't know what the legal repercussions they have or any, any of the stuff that they
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.880]   signed is.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.280]   But the thing that occurred to me reading this is that there was no matter what was
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.760]   going on, there was absolutely no downside to Taylor Swift's or Taylor Swift's people
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   posting this.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.440]   Whether this would affect actual change in which Halo, how great, how great and respected
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.720]   Taylor Swift's word is, or nothing would happen in which she is seen as sticking up
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.880]   for, for independent musicians.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.600]   Either way, this is, it's good stuff for her to do.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.760]   And in terms of self interest, there's certainly going to be a larger self interest of a, of
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.920]   a kind, but listen to what you can't think that this was a problem that she needed to
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   solve for herself.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920]   I put it back.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   No, and that she says that.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.200]   And you know, she's obviously doing fine.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.560]   Tom Conrad, who's the CTO at Pandora, had a series of eight tweets.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.560]   He's pretty angry.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.440]   Spotify, he starts Spotify, YouTube Pandora and all others pay artists for their free
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.960]   tiers and trials.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   It's the right thing to do.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.640]   Swift took her new album off Spotify, not because she's not paid, but because she feels
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.240]   their free service, quote, devalues music.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.200]   Swift never pulled from YouTube, which is the most popular free service.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   And certainly devalues music if Spotify does.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.400]   Swift's career was built in terrestrial radio play, which is a free service.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.520]   And people don't necessarily understand this.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.600]   I know you do, Alex.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.920]   Doesn't pay recording artists.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.280]   They only pay the publishing rights.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:47.200]   The ASCAP BMI fees go to the songwriter or whoever owns the copyright.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.760]   Apple isn't getting rid of its long free trial and is now going, but is now going to pay
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   artists.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.200]   This simply puts it at parity with everyone else.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.360]   Reminder, Apple uses music to make billions off hardware.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.560]   It's nothing from this.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.920]   Swift's letter, and this is the important part, and Apple's response is mostly theater.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.400]   Nothing here to suggest that Apple treats artists more fairly than anyone else.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   My point is this.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.720]   There's too much animus between artists and Silicon Valley.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.880]   We shouldn't herald this move as progress.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   It's status quo.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.320]   And my point is the artists should embrace Silicon Valley and get rid of the labels because
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.360]   that's the predator here, not Apple.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   Humans are funny.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.120]   Like one of the things I noticed is that everyone on Twitter, at least when I was following
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.920]   it, was saying that either the artist should suck it up or that Apple should pay and almost
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.280]   no one said, "Hey, why can't we start paying for the music immediately if we want to?
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   Why can't we pay for this?"
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   There you go.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.640]   Because nobody wants to pay for content anymore.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.200]   They always want someone else to pay for them.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   It's a really good point.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   Apple's a great target.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.440]   The recording artists are a great target.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   It happens with apps.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   It happens with websites.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.520]   It happens like we go through some podcasts.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.120]   That's a very excellent point.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.160]   Can I just make a point?
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.720]   I do think that there's a lot of sense in what you say.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:58.120]   I also think there's a lot of sense in comparing it to you're going out to eat with three
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120]   friends of yours.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.360]   One of these friends makes $1.8 billion a year.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.440]   The rest of you are doing okay.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.080]   He wants to stiff the waitress for a tip.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.760]   He tells the rest of the tip, "Well, look, if you want to tip them 40% to make up for
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.520]   what I'm not going to kick in, why don't you go ahead and do that?"
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.480]   I understand all that.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.200]   This move from Apple's part is absolutely, they could not buy this.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.400]   The best way to put it for me is that this is a huge investment for Apple.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.880]   Paying off artists has so many returns to them that it should be a no-brainer.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.240]   But I also am continuously surprised.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.520]   You hear it every day developers talking about how they can't make sustainable businesses
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.360]   on anybody's app store.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.680]   Amazon was toying with subscription app services as part of Prime.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.520]   You have this raised to the bottom where you want these streaming services.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.000]   But I don't know if Apple pays the artist or not, if 100 million people sign up or not,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.280]   I still don't know if it's going to be sustainable.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.400]   I don't know if content blockers are going to hurt websites.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.320]   I don't know if podcasts are going to make enough.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.000]   All of this goes back to, as individuals, we don't want to pay for this stuff anymore,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.760]   but we still want it produced at a very high level.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.080]   I think all of us are struggling to find those models.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.280]   I think a lot of people are willing to pay their 10 bucks a month.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.840]   In fact, for me, the family edition is going to drop my cost in streaming.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.960]   So $14.99 for six people is going to be a lot less than I'm paying now.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.600]   If Spotify, which they said they will, does the same thing, would that change your tune
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.320]   or are you going to beats no matter what?
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.800]   No, I'm leaving Spotify.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.880]   And the number one reason I'm leaving Spotify is because every time I turn on my phone,
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.840]   I have to go into settings and turn off social.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.920]   You know, so like I don't want to share with anyone what I'm playing because I don't want
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.320]   to commit, how often I listen to Katy Perry or Taylor Swift or anything else.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320]   I'm proud of that.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   I like to.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.280]   You like this.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.240]   My recommendation today is one that I think will save a lot of people a lot of money.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.240]   I know it has for me.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   And that is the Staples app.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.720]   Now, you know, oh, that was easy.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   The Staples app.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.920]   So here is why.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.600]   The Staples app is free, but more importantly, it has a feature in it that is very important
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.200]   if you ever have, if you have a Staples nearby.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.320]   So let me, let me show you.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.640]   So you see, if I, if we look at this here, you see, you've got all these little, these
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   little things here.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.280]   And the thing that you're going to notice is you'll be really surprised to see that this
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.880]   is 1599.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:13.120]   Now that may, now that may be something that is a little bit kind of abrupt because you're
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   used to seeing this be $82 in Staples show off.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   Okay.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.560]   That's what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, whether going to be closer to the
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560]   coast.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560]   No, no, I don't have the green screen yet.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   That's coming.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560]   Miss.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   We're going to be right back there.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.200]   I just had a flea flicker or were they doing the nickel offense there.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   I love how.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200]   That's a humble tech.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200]   So, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.000]   So the thing is, is that what you're going to see here is you're going to have these
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   exes and those.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   And this guy, that looks good.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   That's the best look at Telestrator I've ever.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.840]   Never seen forget the Staples thing.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.320]   They're a lot of work.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.560]   Alex Lindsey, as he travels about from time to time stops by, we're so glad that you're
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]   here.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]   It was great to be here.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.760]   Even if I made it for myself over Spotify.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]   Did you?
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.560]   I don't think you did.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   I missed that part.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   I did.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   So here's the thing.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.840]   I think that what happened is it used to be that it would still share inside Spotify.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.040]   And I just got into the habit of it.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   So the whole, the whole thing with the.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.040]   They listened to you.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   They fixed it and you ignored them.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   And then I ignored them and complained about it online.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   So I'm.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.880]   It didn't, it didn't make yourself look foolish.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.040]   You would be making yourself look foolish if you were to give yourself a bright red
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.200]   groucho mustache and I and and and and and and eyebrows.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.400]   Oh, that he would.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.200]   Oh, wait, how would you do such a thing?
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.920]   You couldn't do that.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920]   That's not possible.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.920]   I go.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.920]   Zoom in.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920]   Oh my God.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920]   What is he doing?
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   He's desirable.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.920]   I know.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   I can't cut away from this.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   This is too good.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:45.920]   Sorry, that was fun.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920]   That was awesome.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.680]   That was a little shepherd fairy moment there.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.840]   That was amazing.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840]   Very talented.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.080]   One of the other interesting bits in use that came out on July 1st, Johnny, I have assumed
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.680]   his role of chief design officer at Apple and the updated apple.com.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   It's fun to say.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.880]   Basically, everything I look about this, I see him just like putting his his sto, his
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.840]   his is like a stove top hat.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.040]   Just his pan on the top of his head, sling a bag of apple seeds and just walk in barefoot
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.560]   across the entire world spreading, spreading design.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.560]   It was a really majestic sort of description of someone who doesn't has certainly has a
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.920]   lot to do, but they're not really explaining what it is he's going to have to be doing.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.040]   I thought it was great because they just they made a very subtle update to Apple.com,
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.760]   but they also added bios for the two people who are basically replacing him as day to
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.480]   day managers of Apple, the new vice president.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.400]   And that's Alan die who's taking over human interface, the H.I.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.840]   group and Richard Hoarth, who's taking over industrial design, the ID group.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.920]   But it caused a bit of a kerfuffle because on the internet, it says that they are on apple.com.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.360]   It says that they're reporting to Tim Cook and not Johnny.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.880]   I've a couple of things sort of stood out at me there.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.440]   One is that all the vice presidents listed on apple.com report to Tim Cook.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   Ken Ferry on Twitter pointed out that no Steve Jobs only had one direct report and that was
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.960]   Steve Wozniak and Steve Wozniak had no direct reports and everyone else went technically
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   to Tim Cook.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.000]   And Apple sort of like correct me if I'm wrong, but Apple just doesn't see org charts the
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.640]   way other companies do, I think.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.880]   And it's dangerous to sort of read into what they put on apple.com.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   Absolutely.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.240]   Apple.com I mean, come on, apple.com is designed to showcase for the shareholders and it's
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:32.720]   designed to showcase for the media, basically.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.920]   It's not really designed to show like if apple really wanted to roll out a here's how our
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.520]   management structure works and here are lines and they could, but they're not going to their
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.800]   management structure I feel like is just as much a not necessarily a trade secret, but
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.480]   is part of what makes apple apple.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.960]   It's part of how they build their company.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.160]   And just because you have, oh, they report directly to Tim Cook.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.320]   That means Johnny I was thinking about retiring.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.200]   No, it means they're vice presidents.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.600]   They're all the VPs talked to Tim Cook.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   That's how it works.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   They're VPs.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.840]   Johnny, Johnny Saruji who runs chipsets doesn't report to Dan Reicho, your reports to Tim Cook.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.000]   It's interesting, but I think it's hard to make a case, whatever you feel about Johnny
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.680]   at, whether you feel this is him starting to retire or him going in a different direction
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.880]   and maybe assuming more responsibility, whether you think this is an elaborate plan to hide
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:29.800]   his salary from Wall Street or you think it's just a way to make him content and happy to
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.200]   continue his job.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.640]   I think apple.com, you worked there actually.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.600]   I think apple.com is never a good way to assess any of this stuff.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.600]   No, absolutely.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.440]   I think serenna hit it right on the head in terms of, you know, it's for shareholders.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.440]   It's for media.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.600]   It's to sort of placate the people responsible for our stock price and make sure, well, they're
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.560]   stock price and make sure that there's no panic.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.000]   I do think it is interesting that they're reporting to Tim, but I feel like that's an
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   organizational thing.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.640]   Like maybe Tim writes their performance reviews at the end of the year or something.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:10.560]   If we're under the auspition, that Johnny is sort of accepting or taking on a little
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.520]   bit less responsibility or a little bit less of the management responsibility as was in
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.000]   one of those articles recently, then I think it makes perfect sense that he wouldn't, they
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.920]   sort of wouldn't directly report to him in a managerial structure.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:30.360]   The apple car rumor persists.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.480]   Is it a waste of time to even talk about this?
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.200]   No, I mean, it's what they're working.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.760]   It's the same thing about talking about the watch for four years ago.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.480]   It's a product that they're exploring and they got a lot of people working on it and
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.760]   we have no idea what it's going to ultimately end up looking like.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.840]   Wall Street Journal says that they've just hired a auto industry veteran from Fiat.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.040]   Doug Betts, he led global global quality at Fiat.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.040]   You know what?
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.520]   Well, that's not a really good recommendation.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.240]   But B, it may not be cars.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.840]   He could just be, he's an expert in global quality.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.840]   Manufacturing it.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.840]   Manufacturing it.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.320]   It could be QC on computers, so that would be cars.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.440]   The interesting thing when you notice is that they're not getting a lot of people who are
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.240]   on their way up in the auto industry.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.280]   They're getting people to leave really great jobs to take jobs at Apple.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.520]   And so that would at least indicate that this isn't something that, well, we try a whole
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   bunch of things.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.360]   We have a, we try to square iPad and we try to Mac with a touchscreen.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:33.560]   This is, it's hard to get someone to leave a really great career on something that Apple
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.800]   is just sort of thinking about.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.560]   So it leaves me with the impression that Apple really, really does intend to actually
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.280]   put something on the road.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:46.640]   But whether they can actually pull it off remains to be seen.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.540]   It did make me think though that this is one product that's maybe kind of perfect for
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.640]   Apple in that they don't have to build a Toyota.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:59.080]   They don't, they really, they, if they sell 10,000, 20,000 of these, that can amount to
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.080]   a success.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.160]   And it is something that they can target people who are specifically looking for something
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.320]   that is elegant, that is well designed, that has a certain luxury phony baloney cache about
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   it.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   If they want to take advantage of that as well.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.200]   Tesla did brilliant stuff because they couldn't, they, the early days, of course, they couldn't
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.640]   build a 20 or $30,000 car.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   They even, they couldn't even build a car that would meet the conventional definition
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.960]   of an automobile given range.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.960]   But what they could do is if they built it in a, in a luxury frame and they made it something
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.240]   that is hard to obtain and very exclusive and something that would only appeal to people
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.920]   who are very much interested in wherever the next wave is, they got all those people to
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:43.640]   pay 80 to $110,000 for the car that then allowed them to then build the $30,000 or $40,000
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.960]   car a few years later.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.400]   So this, it's even better than the watch.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.640]   It seems this could be like a perfect Apple product.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   Interesting.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:57.560]   Webster in our chat room points out that Fiat owns Ferrari and Eddie Q is on the Ferrari
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.560]   board.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.400]   It's Kevin Bacon there somewhere.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.920]   Well, but those things can be problematic too because if you're on a board and you poach
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:09.760]   an employee from that club was on the Nike board and they still get watches.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.920]   So the interesting thing to me here is not like Apple executives on your board.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.040]   If all they do is use it to do it.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.720]   Totally Eric Schmidt smooth.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720]   I mean, that's right.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.720]   Exactly.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.720]   You could argue it as Eric Schmidt.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.520]   The thing is going to be about this is that Apple can make a beautiful car.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.200]   Like Apple is just a great industrial design company and they can hire a lot of people
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200]   to make a beautiful car.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.000]   But the thing that interests me about Apple is that they're not just a manufacturer.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.960]   They do integrated products on the chipset on up.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.440]   And I think like things like the software story and the services story are going to be,
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.400]   you barely think about software on cars.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.760]   Maybe you look at the big Tesla screen and you wonder why you have during fireball it.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.360]   It's 17 inches on your dashboard.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.880]   But I think there's a real or I think maybe Apple thinks is a real opportunity to solve
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.280]   cars from an interface perspective.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.760]   And you often heard Steve Jobs's time, you know, cracking the interface for the TV and
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.960]   various products like that.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:02.400]   And the Apple watch is beautiful, but it's ultimately the software on that that we experience.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.960]   And I think just based on rough rumors of who's working on this kind of stuff, they have a
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.240]   lot of really, really smart people beyond the atoms and on the bits on these projects.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.160]   And to sort of get an idea of what Apple thinks a car should be running, not necessarily
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:19.400]   how it runs, but what software runs on that, I think that's going to be an extremely interesting
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   thing to see.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.040]   You tried talking about that.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.320]   Ours Technica, I think it was an article that was, who wrote it?
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320]   I think it was ours.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:32.360]   I can't remember that said that you can jam this stylus back in and you can.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   It goes in.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   This is backwards.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   It goes in.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   It's a little bit different.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.440]   I told people not to do this, but they didn't.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.240]   But it sounds like you're through the statement now, which is amazing.
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.320]   They say people that they should read the manual.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.480]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.080]   You're inserting it wrong.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.440]   We highly recommend our Galaxy Note 5 users follow the instructions in the user's guide
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.800]   to ensure they do not experience such an unexpected scenario caused by reinserting the
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.320]   S pin in the other way around.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.760]   You're inserting it wrong.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760]   Wow.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.280]   So what happens is it's very easy to do that.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.280]   Oh, I just did it.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280]   Oh crap.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.440]   Leo.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.240]   And that's their official stance is RTFM.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.400]   It's the, it's the series Leo.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   Did you just do it?
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   Really?
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.040]   With draw the stylus.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.960]   It, it, I thought, because it went in so easily, I thought, oh, this isn't going to be a problem
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   to get it out.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   Oh my.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.400]   The clippers closed down on it apparently.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.440]   They did.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.760]   And now you're not supposed to rip it out.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   You're supposed to gently.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   Yes.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   No, no, I can do that.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.560]   Don't get those players anywhere near it.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560]   Oh my God.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.760]   I can't believe I just did that.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   You answered it.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.720]   I'm pushing in the whole rest of the way.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.680]   You may not have damaged the damage.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.920]   No, I haven't damaged the thing yet.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.120]   The damage occurs because it's still loosely in there.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.720]   The damage occurs when you.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.560]   So something closed on it, Renee?
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.920]   Yeah, apparently there's some sort of a gripper inside.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.400]   At least that's from the stories that I've read.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.960]   I feel like it's gripped it.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.000]   And the, and the problem is that if you, if you, if you pull it out in an injudicious fashion
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.640]   that way, then it will, it won't break the phone.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.960]   It will just damage the sensor that the thing uses to detect whether this, the stylus is
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.680]   inside the holder or not.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.720]   So that you'll lose that you will lose that cool feature where it says you dislodge it.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   You pull it out.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.720]   It's ready to take.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   Don't come at me with tools.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   Please.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.720]   I think this, what do you think?
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   What do you think?
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.880]   It was like black rubber and you tell people today and it's a silly or antenna.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   There you go.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   Just hold the phone upside down.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   It'll look like an antenna.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   That's the galaxy.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   It'll be the galaxy.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   Oh gee.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   Right?
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   I thought the OG with the giant hair.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   The OG, the old school.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.240]   I thought that it would be harder to do.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.720]   I thought I should have read that.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.840]   It's the manual.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.240]   I thought that, oh, at some point it will give me some resistance.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.680]   Then I'll push on it and that's when I'll be in trouble.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.040]   But in fact, it just loosely slid in and then I tried to retract it.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.840]   That illustrates a lot though.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.840]   So it is a problem.
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.840]   You know what?
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.440]   Sam, Sam, I'm claiming that read the manual.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.680]   Otherwise, you know, this is going to happen to you.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.840]   Like if there's no resistance whatsoever, it just seems like it would be very, very
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.840]   easy to make that mistake.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.840]   Yeah, because you're not even looking.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.840]   Gosh darn it.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.520]   Leo, it's going to be okay, right?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.800]   Because you can take it to the Genius Bar.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.000]   Oh, the Smarty Pants Bar.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.800]   Smarty Pants Bar.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:19.360]   I'm always pleased when like Samsung seems to be learning stuff like the Galaxy S6.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.440]   It's the nicest phone they made in a while.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.680]   But it's like, I wish that there's somebody you need to hire or fire at that company that
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.600]   says, well, that was really too easy.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:34.440]   That's the sort of thing that a higher life form would not design a phone that way.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   Somebody just didn't-
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.040]   Just like test it first, put a twizzler in and see what happened.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.840]   Somebody didn't really think about it.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:44.400]   So what's happened is the top is now trapped inside a-
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.200]   And it's still, you can see it's still loose.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.880]   In fact, every time I do this, the buzzer goes off that I've removed the pen.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.720]   So it's on the sensor there.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.400]   It's like a little curse, something.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.480]   Oh my gosh.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.360]   I'm sure that if you've got an appropriate spudger, you could slide it out.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.880]   Yeah, I need a spudger.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.600]   So I was poo-pooing this story because I thought, well, you'd have to be a moron.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.000]   You'd have to be a moron.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.200]   Just take this in the wrong way.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.200]   Apparently so.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.200]   Hey, sing.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   Sorry.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.200]   Apparently the joke was right there.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   I had to do it.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.200]   You're not a moron.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.200]   This is a badly designed product.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200]   Apparently you don't.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.480]   I was, because I love this, I love this phone, but boy, I guess I won't be using it much
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.560]   anymore.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.920]   I guess I could pull it out.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.920]   I could pull it out really hard, but it will just, it will break the sensor.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.480]   And I don't know, the sensor's not super important, but it's kind of important.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.720]   Like, you want the sensor because that's the thing that first lets you draw on it when
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.720]   the phone's off.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.720]   No.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.200]   You knew what you were doing, Leo, and you got stuck.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.840]   I mean, imagine just someone not paying attention.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:53.400]   But if you like, sort of like unscrew it as you take it out, if you rotate it, it's
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.120]   not going to get less bad.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.600]   Is there a narrow wound right now?
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.600]   Where's the manual?
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.600]   There's no manual.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.400]   This didn't come with a manual.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.400]   There's like a booklet.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.920]   It must have a Samsung set to read it.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.400]   You don't have to fix it right now, Leo.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.600]   Get one good drink in you.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.400]   Get nice and mellow and relaxed.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   This is great.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.440]   I need to use get maybe some KY jelly or something and also show title.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.440]   I think the title.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.760]   I can't believe I did that.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.720]   I even knew you knew, but I didn't know, but I thought that it will be harder.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.400]   That was very loosely going in.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.400]   There was nothing.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.960]   I thought it would be harder.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.640]   All I need is some KY jelly.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   I inserted it wrong.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640]   You inserted it wrong.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640]   That's the title.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.800]   Right now, I'm sorry.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.280]   It's just.
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.280]   This is so.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.280]   So, Renee, are you?
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.880]   Are you just like with your freehand like writing an I'm or call about this?
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.800]   No, this is still Nick and his problem.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800]   Android Central.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.960]   I have to deal with this.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.960]   I can't.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.520]   I'm actually actively sad because I like this phone.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.520]   Oh, right.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   I know.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   And it's a stupid.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.680]   It's by the way, it costs me almost $900.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.480]   Can you imagine Apple if they made the Apple watch and you slid one of the the buckles in
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.120]   wrong if it just got stuck halfway there and you could never get it out again?
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.080]   Like they've got to just test these things.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.240]   Like how does this go past like UA?
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:22.840]   That I mean, that is a good comparison because, you know, the styluses on the iPhone are.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   They don't have anything.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.440]   They eliminated the problem, Andy.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.360]   They didn't stop the problem at the end of the cycle.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.560]   They stopped getting the change.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.760]   I guess I guess what I should do now is figure out how to take the whole thing apart.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.320]   Because I damaged anything yet.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.560]   As I said, posted the.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.560]   Is there a fix?
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560]   I don't know.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   I don't know.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   Maybe I fixed it.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.560]   Later tonight on all about Andrew.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:49.200]   We'll use your phone as a cautionary tale.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.600]   I am so bummed out.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.840]   I'm so sorry.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   Is it within 14 days?
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.840]   Can you just exchange it?
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.840]   It is.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   Oh, hey, I just bring it back to 18.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.280]   I got a problem.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.760]   Hey, it's with a 14 day win by listening.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.760]   All right.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760]   I'm going to the 18.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760]   Yeah, I would definitely.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   I would definitely.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.760]   I'm saying dude.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.760]   Yes.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.760]   Dude, I can't.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   What happened?
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   Can't stylus.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.440]   Oh, yeah, we heard about that on Android Central.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.440]   You put it in wrong.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.640]   Did you read the manual, sir?
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.920]   What manual?
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.200]   I have to bring this to 18.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   T since after the show.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.200]   And you got to wait in line about the last.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.680]   We'll all be standing there like this with a stylus coming out of.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.800]   You want to go to work out to write on another galaxy note.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.800]   That's the brilliant plan.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:36.320]   You end up with a really big stylus.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   Plus stylus.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   There you go.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.760]   Does this count as intentional like damage like I broke it?
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   No, this is accidental.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   Dude, we still.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.760]   Like they're watching YouTube.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   You're right.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.840]   This should not happen.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.600]   The three of us are willing to swear you were taking great care of that stylus.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.120]   I just was putting it.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.800]   This is not your fault.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.400]   There are people to blame for that.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.360]   None of them are at this table Leo.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.520]   Just tell them that tell them the antenna is falling out.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.400]   I got it.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.200]   You know, the antennas falling out.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.200]   I don't know.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.880]   And it doesn't seem to stay in when I was a million to one shot.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.680]   You're the ass man.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:28.720]   Yes, this is the answer.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.440]   We have a good we have a good plan for you.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.440]   I wonder.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.440]   Okay, I'll report back with it.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.120]   No, don't come at me with tools.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   I'm telling you.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.800]   I'm not going to 18 T unless you're willing to take this to a 10 T it's staying right there.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.480]   And I'm not touching it with no I fix it.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.480]   Spudger kid.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   It doesn't really seriously Jason.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.280]   This is not what it's trying to.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:49.280]   I have a natural.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.280]   For you Leo.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.280]   And right now they're settling on Penn gazee.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.280]   That's going to be low.
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.280]   Yes.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.640]   And God, I have to stylus gate pen gate.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.280]   And now it's on Penn gazee and Brad Mullen has admitted defeat with me.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.920]   You mean wipe it with a cloth?
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.680]   Holy cow.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.480]   And kind is born to trouble just as surely as a spark.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:10.360]   Why isn't this class action?
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.320]   Like, there's a lot of people.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.520]   Does it happen to a lot of people?
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520]   I don't know.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:19.400]   It will be a battery was it the iPod battery was a class action thing because I got a new
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.400]   iPod out of it.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.280]   Well, Apple's doing a Apple bringing back phones that have a camera problem.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:28.400]   So hopefully Samsung brings back phones that have a stuck style or I guess all of them have
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   this stuff.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.960]   Don't look at this and say I can fix it.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   You can't.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.960]   Come here.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.960]   Come here.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   This is our repair guy.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   You can fix anything.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.760]   But you see how loose it is?
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:42.200]   And then when it comes right there, it's there's something it's no, no, I'm taking
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.200]   the AT&T.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.200]   I don't want to.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.960]   He's going to take the ATT guys is what it looks like you slid something in there, sir.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.960]   And I venture to guess that you aren't the only person that's going to be taking the
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.520]   note five back for this very reason.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.760]   I swear to God, I thought this story was link bait was spurious.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760]   Come on.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.760]   Who's going to put it in backwards?
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.760]   You'd have to force it.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.160]   And then of course it would be stuck.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.800]   No, it slides in really.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:09.480]   I mean, there's no resistance until there is when you try to remove it.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.640]   Design should have caught this in some way.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.800]   They should have built in some sort of mechanism that prevents it from sliding in backwards,
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.240]   especially if it results in such an easy locking in this way.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   It would have been easy, easy, easy.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.240]   That's it.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240]   That's a design issue.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.240]   Well, you can make sure you can't do it twice, Jason.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:27.240]   I mean, remember I can withdraw this pen show this for BCL.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.240]   I'm stronger.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   I define providence.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.320]   But a lowly stable boy.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.400]   Surely he cannot speak the note before.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.240]   Was Leo was the note five year pick for today?
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.240]   Home award.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.040]   I'm supposed to review it for you.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.040]   I know you buy.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.640]   Oh, it was going to be a color.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.440]   Well, you're not wearing it.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.440]   There's a review.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   Yep.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   Okay.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:01.880]   If 18T will not exchange it, then Burke, I will give you an opportunity to attempt to
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.960]   work your wily ways upon it.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.600]   I like something in the chat room said, put a straw.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.520]   Although, I mean, there's a little air gap.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.680]   You could put a little straw around that.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.320]   If you found something small enough.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.600]   Oh, and then as a sheath.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.600]   Can I tell you?
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.400]   That's not a bad idea.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.880]   Jason, why do you keep coming at me with crap?
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.960]   You know, when I broke my iPhone 5 in the first week, it was also, I hated that I broke
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.240]   it, but it was also an opportunity to say, okay, let's see how good customer service
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.240]   is.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.240]   No, I always.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.560]   This is a great opportunity for you to bring it in, explain what happened honestly, and
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.840]   then to see if AT&T/SAM-SUNG decides to be awesome.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.560]   Well, or at least acknowledge that, okay, yeah, we kind of, we could have been.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.560]   They filled it to his review unit.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:55.800]   I did it to the phone that I spent 850 bucks on from AT&T and extended my contract for
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800]   two years.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.800]   We had a bunch of people in the forum, we had a bunch of people in the forums who had
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   had done this, how we found out about it.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.800]   It's not unusual.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.800]   No, they weren't paying attention.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   It would be easy to do.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.800]   Like they said, it felt like it worked.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.760]   Yeah, it would be easy to do.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.000]   Jim in the chat room has a good idea, which is pull the stylus out and let it be broken.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   And then go to AT&T and just say it's not recognizing the stylus.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   I'll wait till they refuse.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.840]   I'll wait till they refuse me for this one.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.560]   I guarantee you when I go to the AT&T, they know me at the AT&T.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.120]   I spent a little bit of time there watching us now.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.040]   They're probably watching that.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.720]   That was true when I dunked my iPhone in the water and brought it to the Apple store up
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.280]   here in Santa Rosa.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.520]   I was glad too.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.520]   I was honest.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:39.680]   I said, yeah, I dunked it in a glass of water.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.680]   And he said, yeah, I know.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680]   I saw you do it.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.120]   So it's good I was honest because if I'd said, oh, I don't know what happened, he was
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.880]   said, come on, Leah.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.840]   Oh my gosh.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:53.840]   This is a problem.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.400]   This is not an insignificant problem.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.800]   I now acknowledge this is not linkbait.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.200]   This is not an insignificant problem.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.920]   Kind of a big issue.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.760]   And guess what?
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:13.160]   It's pinkish joining me right now with his pink iPhone 6s plus Renee Richie from imore.com.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160]   So pink.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160]   Both of them.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.040]   You got the silver on the, what do they call it?
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.400]   Aluminum on the little one?
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.080]   Yeah, silver on the 6s and so much rose gold on the 6s plus.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.520]   It really, there's a lot of expanse on the back.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.720]   It's like that dress Leo.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.400]   Like every, like it looks gold, Bennett looks white, Bennett looks pink.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.880]   It's going to be controversy.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.960]   Yeah, I really want to.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.640]   I'm here to tell you while if you look at it straight on and that's why all the pictures
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.480]   look pink, it is pink, but tilt it just a little bit.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.360]   It gets coppery and then a little more and it turns gold.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.440]   Actually, I sound like a rationalizing.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.160]   It's actually very manly.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.400]   Like a party on a phone.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:53.320]   Andy, Andy, Andy, and I go is also here from the Chicago Sun times.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   Hi Andy.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.920]   Hello Leo.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:02.440]   And I hope that to see, I was actually looking forward to having like a rose gold phone and
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.400]   somebody, people in the press have been ruining it by saying that, oh no, there's a trend
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.800]   for men to get pink iPhones.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.760]   We should be there calling it rose gold.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.040]   Like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.680]   You're stupid.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.060]   You're trying to get a take an individual's personal preference and elevate it into a
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.360]   lifestyle trend.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.360]   Stop doing that.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.360]   Rose gold.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.320]   So get a cookie, get your blood sugar back up.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.440]   You will stop coming up with ideas like trying to sell a doll, press to throw in front of things.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.900]   Yes, the pressing rose gold.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:40.300]   So as you pointed out before the show began and I'm now scanning through because I didn't
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:45.140]   know where to come out, a non-tech Joshua Ho has put out and they usually really focus
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.820]   on benchmarks and numbers kind of getting down and dirty on it.
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:52.980]   They've put out their preliminary results in the new iPhone.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:57.820]   Renee, you're going to have to summarize for me.
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:01.500]   So that, I mean in the proud tradition of Anand and Brian Clue, they're just getting
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.500]   deep into the silicon here.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:05.860]   By the way, we should mention that both and Anna and Brian Clue now work for Apple.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.180]   Yes, but Anand Tech has been bought by Perch.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:11.980]   So they're the same company as laptop, Mag, and Tom's diet and Tom's hardware.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:17.500]   And they have a strong kind of roadmap about what differentiates them and it's the numbers,
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.380]   it's the geeks, it's the benchmarks, it's the deep dive.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.220]   So they're going to continue that, which is great.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:26.220]   Yeah, and Josh is enormously intelligent.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.540]   I think he's about 12 years old.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.540]   I don't mean that.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540]   No, he's a kid.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.380]   Yeah, it is crazy how smart he is.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.940]   And then started when he was in high school.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.380]   I interviewed him when he was 16.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   It's the tradition.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:36.380]   It's amazing.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.380]   It's true.
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.380]   They're getting into the technology.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.060]   Like we were talking about, it's a dual source.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:44.540]   I mean, they're getting parts from TSMC, I think you get in the right order, and Samsung.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:47.840]   And that's really hard because they're on different processes and you want similar results.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.460]   But last year we saw like the iPhone shipped with the A8 processor and the iPad Air 2 did,
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.820]   but the iPad Air, I've had many didn't.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:57.180]   They just weren't enough processors.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.780]   And this year they're setting up their shipping tens of millions of phones and they don't
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:03.460]   want to run out and dual sourcing it is super smart.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.220]   But it's the details and they're like what they're doing with the NAND flash storage
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:07.220]   in order to get this.
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:10.060]   It's like some similar to what they were doing with the MacBook storage.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:14.180]   And when the difference between those devices starts to disappear, the idea of how powerful
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:17.940]   and how performant you can make a mobile device gets really, really interesting.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:21.820]   They always like, I didn't know this, but a NAND says they'd always written their own
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:27.180]   or designed their own custom controllers for the SSD, the storage and the phone.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:31.860]   And then this controller looks a lot like the MacBook SSD controller.
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:36.540]   It's always really focused on speed and SSD on the computer side.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.100]   It does make a difference though.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.220]   Well, in this one they're using TL, so they're using different kinds of RAM.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:45.300]   I don't know if it's the same for the S models yet, but for the 6 and 6 Plus they were using
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:51.620]   MLC multi-layer for the lower storage devices and TLC twin layer and TLC is cheaper NAND
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:56.260]   but they're doing a lot to sort of mitigate this or make it just as fast for normal operations
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:01.180]   even though it isn't traditionally as speedily as media technology.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:06.340]   I have to say this phone is a beast and boy, if you look at the NAND read and write benchmarks,
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:14.300]   it is so far beyond the 6S Plus is so far beyond anything we've seen before twice, almost
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:17.420]   twice the speed of the Galaxy S6 and a 6S Edge.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.780]   It's what you get when you have the kind of money Apple does, but you're also writing
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.980]   for a specific operating system and platform.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:27.060]   For example, in Qualcomm makes a chip, it might get sold for a Windows phone and for an Android
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   phone.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.700]   So it's got to support OpenGL, but it's got to support DirectX and you're carrying sort
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.180]   of that load whether you use it or not and Apple can write specifically for what they
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.340]   want to do with the phone.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.740]   Although that's for sequential reads.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:39.780]   The random reads actually the S6 beats it.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.180]   Which I mean, who knows what.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:46.060]   Although they're saying that might be a limitation of the test and not a limitation data so they're
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.060]   going to look at it.
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:52.580]   Yeah, that seems a little odd to be on a sequential reads would do better on a spinning medium,
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:42:00.380]   but I shouldn't make much difference on a random access medium like NAND chips.
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:04.780]   Nevertheless, we're seeing a pretty speedy little device.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:10.180]   It's almost as fast on Chrome Safari and IE as the Surface Pro 3.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.180]   Which is pretty good for a mobile device.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:20.140]   And just in my pure anecdotal experience, the iPhone 6S Plus feels extremely snappy.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:24.700]   I was actually crediting some of that to the fact that it finally has two gigs of RAM.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.020]   Yeah, it's also got as much faster as it's got a 1.8 gigahertz.
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.100]   Now it's called a Twister, the Apple A9 Twister.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.620]   A processor in it.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:37.020]   Apparently the S6 also uses NVMe, so it's a similar nanotechnology which would explain
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.020]   why it's up there.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:42.980]   This is one of the reasons why I'm looking forward to the iPad Pro so much that it's
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:49.060]   an iOS device, but it really shows you how much performance a phone or laptop leaves
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.460]   on the table when it's just has to use off the shelf components.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:56.580]   When you really do build everything to work together for this one application, you'd
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.740]   leave nothing on the table.
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:01.100]   Apple TV has arrived.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:03.300]   Many of us have them.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:06.860]   Can you get it in Canada or did you actually bootleg it into the country, Renee?
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:10.540]   No, actually I went to the Apple store as soon as I landed and they had like 300 of them
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.260]   lined out on the shelves.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:13.420]   There's no short supply.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:14.900]   There's no short supply.
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.940]   Yeah, you can't get it anywhere near the content that you get in the US, but you can't
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:18.940]   get the boxes.
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.100]   Yeah, in fact I got one and played with it.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:27.220]   In fact we set it up, showed Megan how to set hers up on iOS today if you want to watch
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:32.860]   that and I've done the unboxing and a little bit of a review.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:36.860]   Lisa said, "Well, how come we only have one?"
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:37.860]   Why is it not in rose gold?
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.260]   Don't I get one in the gym?
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:41.340]   I said, "Okay, okay.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340]   So I ordered two more.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:45.660]   We're replacing the Apple TV basically."
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.140]   I've ordered five Leo.
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.340]   I'm giving you away his Christmas presents.
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:52.580]   They're good.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.820]   I don't know if they're 150 to 200 dollars better than the old Apple TV.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:01.300]   I was going to say, I don't know if they're good.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:06.060]   I'm not sure they're at the, "I'm going to give it to somebody who is not necessarily
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:13.780]   particularly interested in this technology because we've all had some not great experiences
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:18.300]   that first this first weekend, but we motor through them because we have perspective and
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.900]   we see all the benefits that are coming future."
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:25.780]   I'm not sure if my aunt who just wants Netflix would want to go through everything.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:26.780]   I figured this out.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.060]   There's this big disparity.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.500]   If you're in the middle, you're screwed, but if you're on either end, you're fine.
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.900]   If you're a techie, you'll figure your way around it.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:36.580]   I put one in from my mom yesterday and all you had to, we bumped her phone and it was
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:37.580]   basically done.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.580]   She downloaded Netflix.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:42.500]   We put that in once and she's super happy because she doesn't worry about any of the
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.100]   stuff that we worked with.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.740]   You're still stuck with that remote.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.740]   Bumping didn't work for me.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.740]   I was so disappointed.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.580]   That was going to be the coolest thing ever, but bumping the phone didn't work.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.740]   It didn't work for me either.
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:55.340]   It worked after a while.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.740]   It was like half an hour.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:02.580]   We actually had to stop down the show and then we went to manual and I said, "No, I
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:04.620]   refuse to enter passwords that way."
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   Like an animal.
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.620]   Like an animal.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:09.940]   I'm a man and we tried again.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.380]   Is there NFC in the thing?
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:12.380]   How does bumping work?
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.380]   No, you have to be close.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.180]   It's Bluetooth, but it really wants to make some money.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:20.060]   I held it and touched it and did everything.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:22.300]   How can you get closer than physical contact?
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:25.180]   You got to apply yourself, Andy.
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]   You got to want it.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:31.380]   Are you telling me that Apple intentionally installed weak white Bluetooth in there?
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.620]   No, the Bluetooth is fine because it's a little bit of a control.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.260]   No, I imagine it's an encryption thing.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.460]   Oh, it's an encryption thing.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:41.140]   Yeah, I don't know if that's official or if there's security reasons for it needing
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:45.060]   to be closer, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was just, you know, you don't want somebody
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.620]   to authenticate from two rooms away.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:47.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:48.620]   That would just be weird.
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:49.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.860]   We took three hours to sit up.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:55.420]   It'll work eventually.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:00.420]   The best thing to describe the Apple TV is that it is way too long in coming, but the
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.740]   version we're getting is racing out the door.
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:04.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:08.060]   They didn't have enough time for Bluetooth keyboard support.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.020]   They didn't have enough time for it.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.860]   It was the selection of apps.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:18.660]   I've only got to play with it for three days before I had a leave for here, but I'm like,
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.340]   wow, I guess I'm so dumb.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:24.580]   I can't figure out how to get into the App Store because every time I click on this icon,
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:28.980]   I see this place that only has like three apps in each category.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:31.540]   It's like I'm not even trying to be sarcastic here.
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:38.340]   It really is like the Microsoft App Store that if you're going to look for modern apps
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:41.540]   that take advantage of Windows 10 and Windows 8, it's okay.
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:42.540]   Let's get this.
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.820]   Let's see how many different word processors there are for.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:45.820]   Okay.
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.620]   There are two editors and they're both markdown.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.620]   That's disappointing.
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.500]   And so how about I do a search for photos?
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:53.500]   Not really.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.500]   Okay.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:55.500]   Search for podcasts.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   No, really answers.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:58.820]   And you're like, okay, it's day one.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:01.300]   We'll keep the faith, brother.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:02.300]   It'll.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.300]   Two Twitter apps though.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.300]   Two Twitter apps.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.300]   Three.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:07.300]   I'm three.
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:08.300]   Twitter apps.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.300]   All approved for launch day.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.300]   You did a nice.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:15.500]   You did a nice little video at iMore of all of the apps available at launch.
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.060]   A lot of games.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   Because if you didn't know their name, you couldn't even find them yet.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.260]   You have to search them based on name.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:27.220]   The other really cool thing is I was surprised that as soon as I set up, I had a copy of
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.580]   Cannonballed for Apple TV.
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.300]   You installed it on iOS.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.580]   Well, because yeah, exactly.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:36.660]   This whole thing where every game that I ever bought and played for about six weeks and
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:40.940]   then stopped playing is going to start to like like zombie like come back from the grave.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.740]   Like remember, I'm hot ass full of feelings about that.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:45.740]   I mixed feelings about that.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:48.020]   It's a universal purchase.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.020]   It's not a universal app.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:52.340]   It's a completely separate binary, but developers can choose to group them in a way that if
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.100]   you have the iOS app, you get the Apple TV app for free.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.340]   And that's great for us.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:58.660]   But I want a lot of really good games.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.500]   Like I want Adam atomic to make another $10 for Cannonball.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:04.700]   Because you put in like a bunch of new awesome characters and things.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.020]   And I want to give them some new money.
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:10.580]   But then people now when they don't see that purchased app, they just think the app doesn't
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.580]   exist.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.580]   So like they didn't know that.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.820]   It's a little confusing, isn't it?
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.460]   And if you look at the app for people, see it, then not know.
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:23.380]   You did the only way to do this, which is to enter a single letter.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.820]   Because when you enter a letter, it shows you all the things with that letter.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.020]   And you literally went through the alphabet.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:31.900]   To Andy's point, there were not enough apps yet for them to populate categories or top
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:33.060]   ten list when they launched.
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.780]   There was like come some categories with one app.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:36.100]   So they just chose to hide them.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:37.100]   How many are there total?
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.380]   Were there a total on launch?
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.380]   Under a thousand.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.380]   There's over a thousand now.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.220]   Yeah, it's growing fast.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:47.020]   Well, there are three Twit apps now.
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.980]   And none of them official, but all of them great.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:53.500]   One free, two ninety nine cents.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:56.260]   And highly recommend you buy all three.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:59.220]   Or you download the free one, then you buy the other two.
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:02.620]   Actually, one of the things that I thought was really cool about the fourth generation
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:05.740]   Apple TV is how it handles audio.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:11.460]   In previous generations of Apple TV, obviously there's the optical out for optical audio port
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:16.660]   on the third generation Apple TV, but the fourth generation Apple TV is a little unique
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:26.180]   in that it actually has built in AirPlay support for a lot like lossless airplay connection
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:31.940]   so that there's no delay between the AirPlay speaker and what's on your screen, which is
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.940]   kind of fantastic.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.900]   So if you have your AirPlay, say your Sonos system hooked up to an airport express or
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:41.180]   even if you have a Sonos play bar and you have it hooked up to a previous generation
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:46.100]   of your Apple TV, you can actually go into the fourth generation Apple TV's audio menu
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:52.500]   and change the audio source from TV to whatever AirPlay source it is.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.140]   And you can even do that on the fly while you're watching your videos.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.140]   That's pretty cool.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.140]   Really cool.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.220]   That's really cool.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:02.220]   One of the one of the biggest underrated features I think on the.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:07.580]   No, I just I have it hooked via HDMI to my AV receiver, which is probably for people
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:09.460]   who have big setups that can meet.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.740]   That's probably the most likely.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:15.060]   And it by the way does five one beautifully getting great surround sound out of it.
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.060]   Seven point one two.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:17.060]   I'm sure it does.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:20.060]   I have to buy two more speakers to find out.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:24.980]   I really recommend that people go get the read the Apple online user guide.
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:29.740]   There's a lot about the interface that isn't really intuitive, but it's easy but it's not
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.740]   intuitive.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.420]   Like if you have to be one of those people who's a button masher, like double tapping the home
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.020]   button brings up like an iOS six.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:38.020]   Right.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.020]   That's right.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:43.260]   Apps which you can quickly go from, you know, two different apps without having without
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:46.460]   without having to bounce into the home page first.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:51.540]   You can also I was trying to remember whether or not the older Apple TV supports Bluetooth
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:55.380]   audio out, but whether it does or not, the new one also supports Bluetooth audio.
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:00.180]   So if you want to not disturb your partner in bed while you're watching TV, you can do
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:01.940]   wireless headphones with it.
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.940]   That's also fantastic.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.940]   Yeah, yeah, that too.
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.860]   There's so much really cool.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:11.620]   You really should go through settings and just go through every single one of these menus.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:16.460]   There's so much accessibility options that are built in there that it is a slam dunk
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:21.060]   for people who need extra options because that's certainly not something that Roku and others
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:23.780]   are doing a lot of great work with.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:26.500]   You can make your own closed captioning style if you don't like the build.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:27.500]   It's so cool.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:28.940]   Oh, I'm going to have to read this.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:29.940]   I wish they did.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:34.300]   I guess nobody puts this stuff in the box anymore.
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:38.740]   And there's and I discovered if I keep pressing the menu button, I get to the screen saver,
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:39.740]   which is really nice.
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:41.900]   But you have to kind of discover it.
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.580]   There are lots of cool tweaks.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:50.540]   I mean, it's damning with faint praise to say that they made an improvement over the
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:51.540]   old Apple TV.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:56.220]   But a lot of the stuff that I appreciate about it is like you could always reorder the icons
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:52:01.380]   on the launcher menu, but the Apple deck of icons was always sacrosancts.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.460]   But now if you want Netflix, Hulu and HBO go to be on the very, very top problem, just
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.860]   moving right in there.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.260]   You could say, find me funny horror movies.
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:13.980]   It's and those screensavers also, they're going to update those so you can enable it when
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:18.420]   you sign in to update those and they're helicopters and drones and they're filming.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.740]   They are so nice.
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:25.900]   So the John Coates, of course, immediately made a app that I'm sure highly illegally
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:29.300]   connects to the servers because this stuff is served to you.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.300]   They say, what is it?
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.380]   600 megabytes could be as much as 600 megabytes a day.
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:34.380]   A month.
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.380]   A month.
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.380]   Okay.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:37.380]   That's not so bad.
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.860]   That's why there's an option that you can say when, how frequently should I connect to
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.820]   that server and get updates to these things?
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:45.420]   You can actually just say just once a month, don't please don't.
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:46.420]   It's called Ariel.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:49.580]   And while this looks like a still picture, if you look at the cars in the bridge, they're
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.580]   slowly moving.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.260]   There's some potential here.
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:57.180]   Like I make a version of news.app that prioritizes video or start making apps that you put the
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:53:00.460]   Apple TV in a classroom or a meeting room and all the iPad because there's a yoga app
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:03.660]   already and turn it over to the name because I never do.
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:06.940]   But it takes a heart rate from your Apple watch and puts it up on the monitor while
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:07.940]   you're exercising.
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:08.940]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.940]   All the stuff working together.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:14.020]   I can imagine a bunch of kids in classrooms, all of them with iPads and the Apple TV in
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.500]   the front and all of them working on things.
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:18.540]   I mean, it's really cool that this stuff is just linked together.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:20.700]   Some of this is plain footage.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.940]   Some of this is obviously drone.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:27.020]   As you mentioned, drone footage, you're flying really low across vegetation in Hawaii.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:31.260]   And it's really clear that that's not an airplane.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:34.140]   It's really, this is amazing footage.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:38.220]   The screen saver is available for Macintosh as it's called Ariel.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:43.100]   And John has put out a beta version of it that lets you cache the videos, which I would
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:48.940]   recommend because I have a feeling Apple might cut off his access at any time, although
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.340]   they haven't so far.
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.660]   I mean, they're super proud of these.
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:53.660]   These are gorgeous.
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.740]   They should be proud.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.740]   They should make this on the Mac screen saver.
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.740]   So anyway, since they haven't, Ariel is the name of it.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.980]   OS 10 Golden Gate will have a message.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:03.980]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:06.460]   Wouldn't that be a great screen saver?
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:08.220]   Hey, the new iPad is here.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.100]   The new iPad is here.
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:15.620]   And I trust you have all received your units in the mail.
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:16.620]   So big.
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.620]   So big.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.620]   So big.
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.940]   So we hold them up and no one can see any of us.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:25.500]   And then if you put it in, this is, they, when I went to the Apple store, because I
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:28.340]   ordered it that night and then they said, well, just pick it up tomorrow morning in the
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.420]   Apple store.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:33.660]   They didn't have the Apple keypad keyboard.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:34.660]   That one.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:39.340]   So they, I got the creative, which actually I like better because it's, first of all, $20
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:43.180]   cheaper, but it also has special iPad buttons.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:46.260]   You know, it's got a home and I love the search button, which is great.
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:48.940]   Mine is laser-oblated taffeta, Leo.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.900]   I mean, just pretty sweet.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:53.620]   It's like in Project Runway, taffeta.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.620]   That's a hard material to keep in control of.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.620]   It's in gun will do.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:01.420]   How many prom dresses and bridesmaid dresses had to give their lives to make this keyboard?
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:04.580]   Is that taffeta on yours too, Andy?
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.580]   Yes.
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:09.220]   Well, I didn't go to prom, so I don't know what taffeta feels like.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.220]   So that's a fabric.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.220]   Because it looks like plastic.
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.220]   That's fabric.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.220]   It's laser-related fabric.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:16.220]   So instead of having a scissors or butterflies, it just has the domes.
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:19.000]   And then the structure of the fabric that gives it its...
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.180]   So it's a chocolate keyboard, let's say.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.180]   Let's tell the truth.
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.220]   I guess it feels a lot like one.
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.220]   It feels like one.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:30.060]   It's a little bit more interesting about that keyboard, though, is that it's all molded.
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:31.060]   Right.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:35.700]   I talked to Apple just before this was all released.
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:44.660]   And it was fascinating to see that there's no actual mechanism in there, you know, which
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.820]   is something we're not used to with the keyboard.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:50.700]   Obviously, there's a mechanism in there to make the key go up and down.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.700]   Are there switches?
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.700]   What's in there?
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.700]   There's no switches, but there are...
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:54.700]   It's molded.
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:57.140]   It's just molded plastic.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.620]   Or molded, you know, fancy stuff.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.620]   Taffeta.
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.620]   It's a taffeta.
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620]   It's a plane.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:03.620]   Taffeta.
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:04.620]   Taffeta.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.620]   So...
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:07.380]   And they can't put wires because you have to fold it.
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:08.980]   And a wire would get crimped if you folded it.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:13.020]   So they did this thing where they actually, almost like a circuit board, they have power,
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.340]   ground, and data all going through the actual fabric itself.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.140]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:20.140]   Wow.
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:23.620]   Well, this is a much more conventional keyboard.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.220]   It just has keys that when you push them, it triggers a switch.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:27.220]   And it's very...
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:28.220]   It's a lot like the MacBook keyboard.
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:32.940]   It lights up in the back, which is nice powered by the connectors, so it's not a battery-powered
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:33.940]   keyboard.
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:35.100]   And then you get this honkin' big case.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.860]   And by the way, if you thought the iPad was big, wrap it in the Logitech Create case.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:41.820]   And now it's bigger than a MacBook.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.700]   It's like the size of my MacBook Pro.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.340]   It's huge and heavy.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:47.340]   But that's what...
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.260]   If you want a really good keyboard, I mean, this is every bit as good as what I've got
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.900]   on my MacBook Pro here.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.740]   We're off this other keyboard.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:55.740]   It's less stuff.
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:58.180]   Yeah, I mean, I could...
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:02.660]   This is so comfortable to use and backlit and scall these function keys too.
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:09.260]   I mean, the first day that I was using it as a full-time device, I was just sort of subconsciously
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.020]   tickling this part here.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.500]   Yeah, it's a trackpad, don't you?
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:14.660]   Lots of people say that.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:17.460]   With this, it'll do.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.340]   And it's great because it's so compact.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.220]   It's lighter, yeah.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:26.380]   It's also great because unlike the Create keyboard, you can easily slap it on and take
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:27.700]   it off again.
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:32.140]   And when it's on, it's practically nothing.
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:38.220]   I think that the ideal thing for this iPad is to just keep it as thin as possible so
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:42.940]   that when you just want to have it even just having it flat on the desktop and interacting
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:48.260]   with this huge, huge control surface, I had my stand with me.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:49.260]   I had all this stuff with me.
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:54.220]   I was in Starbucks, but I found that I kind of like just having it in 2001, a space odyssey
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:58:00.900]   mode where there's just this rectangle of interactive glass almost level with the tabletop.
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.620]   It really is a whole new...
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:06.540]   For something that's so familiar, it really does feel like a whole new way of using an
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:07.540]   iPad.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.340]   Andy, what do you think is split-screen?
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.340]   Love it.
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:14.420]   This is everything that I've been hoping for.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:19.660]   It's one of the biggest things I loved about Windows 8, one of the few things I really loved
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.460]   about Windows 8, was the ability to...
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:24.340]   I don't necessarily need to have a whole bunch of overlapping windows.
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:29.100]   I really just want to have one main, for instance, one main pane that has the stuff I'm creating
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.660]   and then something I'm keeping an eye on.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:32.660]   And you can have that.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.980]   You can have two equal columns like you see Leo doing there.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:42.480]   And you can have one iPad-sized screen, one iPhone-sized screen, and then even the floating
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:45.500]   video window that you can resize that floats over everything else.
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.260]   That's really all I need.
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:54.860]   So yeah, this is for me, and I think any conversation about using this like a notebook has to underscore
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:56.500]   your personal quirks.
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:59:02.380]   For me, this is emphatically as good, if not better, than a MacBook Air.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.380]   Really?
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:04.380]   Yeah, I will say that.
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:11.980]   I've come close to buying a MacBook Air or even the 2015 MacBook just because I just feel
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:17.180]   like I need to have something that's lighter than my MacBook Pro.
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:21.580]   But it always felt like this isn't an improvement over what I've got now.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:25.780]   This is for the things that I would be using a MacBook Air for.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:30.100]   Again, I would not be using it as my 24/7 only Macintosh.
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:31.940]   The MacBook Air...
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:33.580]   The iPad.
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:37.180]   iPad Pro is a better solution for me.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.180]   Wow.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.820]   That's why I have the iPad Pro and I have the 2015 MacBook.
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.620]   And I use split screen on both.
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:45.780]   They're very similar in many ways.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:49.380]   But I have workflows that I still prefer the MacBook, like things that I want multiple
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:52.500]   windows and drag and drop and all that kind of stuff because I've been doing it for a
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.980]   decade and it's hardwired into my system and I'm so fast that way.
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:56.980]   But using...
[01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:57.980]   I just...
[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:00.500]   When I went to Toronto yesterday for the Apple Pay stuff and I just took the iPad Pro with
[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.580]   me and I forgot it was an iPad Pro.
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:08.060]   I was sitting in a coffee shop writing the story and three hours later I forgot that
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:12.620]   I was using an iPad Pro until I decided to get up and then I unfolded it and I was using
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.620]   the Apple keyboard.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.620]   I was just typing away.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:15.620]   I was...
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.620]   We're using half pages.
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:17.620]   What were you using to type into?
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:18.620]   Notes.
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.620]   I've been using the notes.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:20.620]   I've been trying...
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:21.620]   I tried to start with the baseline.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:22.620]   Like I wanted...
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:26.340]   I've been sketching in notes too and I wanted to do just the simplest thing I could at first
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:29.220]   and then after this I'm going to use Coda and I'm going to use Procreate.
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.980]   But I wanted to give myself a couple of days with the built-in apps and really see what
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:32.980]   they...
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:36.220]   I feel like the built-in apps are always the baseline and they give you the idea of the
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.140]   minimum you can do with the system.
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.060]   I was really pleasantly surprised and I also...
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.500]   Notes syncs with everything.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.780]   It doesn't just sync with other iOS devices.
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:46.300]   I changed something in notes here.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:49.020]   When I do go home to my Mac, all that stuff is just there.
[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:52.740]   I have five or six articles that I just wrote in there that are just as valid right now in
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:54.620]   the Notes app on this iMac.
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:57.060]   I really, really like that sort of...
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:00.860]   The whole package with this was just so great and then I folded it up, pulled out the pencil
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:02.740]   and started sketching while I waited for my plan.
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:04.740]   Wait a minute on the pencil thing.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:05.740]   Yes.
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:07.900]   How did you get a pencil?
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:10.780]   Apple provided pencils to people who are getting them.
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:13.100]   I'm not the only person.
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:14.100]   The pencil...
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.020]   I got online pretty quick.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:19.580]   It was like four in the morning our time and there were no pencils to be had.
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:20.580]   It said December.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.100]   You'll get yours December 7th.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.900]   I think that once you let all really great things, once you get it, you will forget about
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:27.900]   how long you had to wait.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:28.900]   You had to wait for it.
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:29.900]   It's amazing.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:30.900]   It's fun.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:31.900]   I was using the Notes app to sketch with.
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.140]   I don't know if this can be seen or not, but...
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:35.140]   You're a good...
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.140]   Go full screen on.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:37.140]   Oh, look at that.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.140]   Oh, I saw that.
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:39.140]   You posted that.
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:40.140]   That's Tim Cook announcing the iPad Pro.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.140]   And I just started trying...
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:42.940]   But you're an artist.
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:44.540]   See, for me, it's not going to help.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:45.540]   I'm an idiot.
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:46.540]   I've got to know.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:47.540]   I started...
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:49.020]   This is a friend of mine.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:50.020]   That's a great picture.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.300]   Color of stuff.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:54.460]   So as an artist, this is a great platform, right?
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:57.060]   Leo, there's two things about it that make it terrific.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.300]   Just for some background, I went to school for art.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:01.660]   I drew every day after school for hours.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:03.620]   Went to college in a fine arts program.
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:07.420]   And then I worked in design where I used Wacom tablets for over 10 years.
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.540]   And this is the closest thing I've ever felt to when I used to just draw with a pencil
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:11.540]   on paper.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:14.700]   And it's not exactly the same way, but it's super close.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:18.660]   And the nice thing is with a program like Procreate, I used to do all the kind of art.
[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:19.820]   Like, you did oils and passed out.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:24.100]   And then just going to the store, buying the stuff, coming, setting up, cleaning up...
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:27.340]   It became as time got more and more constrained.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:28.940]   I just didn't take the stuff out anymore.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.580]   It's sitting in a closet now.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:34.140]   And with this, I just pick a brush, start there, and now I'm doing a watercolor.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:35.980]   It's like paperless art.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:42.140]   If they made a pencil version for an iPad Air or a mini, would it be as good?
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:43.140]   So the technology...
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:47.060]   No, I understand, but I'm saying next generation, let's say they make...
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.420]   Do you need all that real estate is the question.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:55.180]   I would love an iPad Air 3 with the same type of 203 Hertz refresh rate and the electromagnetic
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:56.340]   stuff in it.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.500]   To be honest, I would love this in an iPhone 6 Plus.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:03.300]   I know some people are complaining about the lack of touch ID, but these are all different
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.300]   technologies.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:06.740]   The force press in the watch is different than the force press in the Mac.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:07.820]   It's different than 3D touch.
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:09.700]   It's different than the precious ones in a pen.
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:13.140]   And you start putting all those things together and you got really thick, really heavy screens.
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:15.020]   So they have to sort of pick and choose for now.
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:20.220]   But in a perfect world, I would have a little field notes version on my iPhone 6 Plus where
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:22.460]   I could sit there and do it all out in the park or something.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.460]   I'm a huge fan of this technology.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:25.460]   Yeah.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.460]   It's just amazing.
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.460]   Renee is absolutely right.
[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:31.980]   I'm not really an artist, but it just allows you to play and make mistakes.
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:34.220]   And I've never drawn with color.
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:38.980]   But I mean, as I just don't understand how mixing colors works and how the tools work,
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:44.900]   the fact that you can just screw around work based on a photo and just make mistakes and
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:47.340]   make them very easily.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:52.220]   It's procreate has become my favorite game, my favorite iPad game ever, because you just
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:56.100]   got some time to kill and you just want to fool around.
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:59.420]   Every time I've set down thinking I was just going to fool around for a second because
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:02.660]   oh, I want to test this out or I just want to see if this works.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.340]   It's like three hours later.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:08.660]   And now I've created something that maybe isn't great, but I'm sort of like now invested
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:12.860]   in it's just amazing pencils.
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:18.820]   I think the thing that you have to remember with the pencil, what Apple was able to do
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:21.100]   was reduce any latency.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:24.580]   And that's the big part about the pencil.
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:33.940]   Now, when I spoke with Apple about how the pencil works between the pencil and the screen
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:42.580]   and the technology that's built into both of those, the screen actually tries to predict
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:43.820]   where you're going to go.
[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:48.220]   So if you're drawing a circle, it'll predict that you're drawing a circle and the pressure
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:59.060]   that you have on that line and it will intelligently go back and backfill the line and the prediction
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:02.540]   so that it's exact to what you actually did.
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:08.300]   So if at the end you put a little bit more pressure on the pencil, it will backfill that.
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:13.820]   Now that's not something you can actually see because it's happening so quickly that
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:16.780]   you don't see it happening.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:20.100]   And that's incredible to think about that.
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.620]   That it's predicting where you're going to go, then goes back and backfills where you
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:31.660]   actually went, but does it in an amount of time that's not visible to you as a user?
[02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:33.220]   That's crazy.
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.500]   Jim was just talking about Apple Music for a second and it occurs to me there's this
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:39.580]   theme going around because Jim is a power Apple Music user and it's been horrible for
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:40.580]   him.
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:43.220]   I just use serial play stuff and it's been fantastic for me.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:48.140]   People who have big collections of media on Drobo's or other devices, they're really
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:52.420]   upset with Apple TV because it stops some forms of MP4 from working and the home app
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:56.660]   is still, the computers app is still a mess and they really can't access their collections
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:59.300]   but I just use it as stream stuff so I'm fine.
[02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:02.660]   Brent Simmons just did a post about his father's ongoing issues with mail and he's a super
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.940]   intelligent guy and mail just won't work.
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:09.900]   John Gruber and Matt trans were talking about how things just won't sink, like you put in
[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:12.580]   a text shortcut and it just doesn't sink.
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:16.980]   We've gotten past this time where things either work or they don't work but the more you use
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:20.060]   a product it looks like the more pain you're getting from that product.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:21.060]   Yeah.
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.380]   Well, I'm not updating it.
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:29.540]   My music doesn't sink between my Mac and my iOS device.
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:37.540]   I mean Apple Music today updated the fact that you could download and make available offline
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:38.900]   your music.
[02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:42.860]   They're five months in and they're just getting around to this now.
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:51.700]   A few weeks ago I went on a trip, I downloaded all of my guns and roses for a short flight
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:58.380]   and I get on the plane, hit airplane mode, eight songs out of a hundred actually downloaded
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:00.820]   so Apple is finally getting to this now.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:07.340]   So when I get to where I was going in order to make sure that I had music for the flight
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:15.020]   home I downloaded Google Play, yeah, I've been using it and it worked well obviously.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:18.700]   Now you look at Apple TV, they updated, updated Apple TV today.
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:25.380]   I haven't tried this yet but when Apple TV first came out I went to Apple Music and added
[02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:26.380]   a song.
[02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:27.380]   Sure.
[02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:28.480]   Okay, you can add a song, no problem.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:35.780]   Then I went to that album and it looks like I have the whole album added to my music when
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:37.980]   I don't, I only have one song.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:43.140]   So I go to remove that album or that song, you know, when you press the button and it
[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:46.780]   comes up with this screen and says remove from my library.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:50.620]   I press that button a hundred times and nothing happens.
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:53.100]   So then I go to cancel and the song is there.
[02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:55.460]   It's like Apple wants me to have this song.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:57.540]   No, I don't want that song.
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:02.340]   So now I'm going to go out as soon as we're done here and try that and see if that bug
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.340]   is fixed.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:06.260]   There are so many bugs, so many bugs.
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:09.780]   Well, at worst they're different for different people so it's very hard to predict what's
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:10.860]   going to happen.
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:18.020]   And the last time Apple had this many bugs in an app, they wrote an apology letter and
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:20.380]   that was with maps.
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:23.380]   So I mean, I don't know what they're doing here.
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:28.900]   I mean, I added Led Zeppelin one and Led Zeppelin two to Apple Music on my Mac, on my
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:30.060]   Mac.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:34.900]   It changed the names of them to Led Zeppelin mothership, both of them, both albums, even
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.540]   though they're different albums.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:41.420]   But on my iOS devices, they were still Led Zeppelin one and two.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.420]   What?
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:44.900]   I thought that my account's same.
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:48.780]   I thought that the Mac and iOS talk to each other.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:49.780]   They're the same.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.740]   Yeah, apparently they don't.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:59.900]   You know, I'm very angry with Apple Music just because I care so much about my music
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:00.900]   and I care.
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.060]   I believe in Apple.
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:07.660]   I believe that what they do is I think that they do great things.
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:08.940]   They innovate.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:12.700]   What they've done with Apple Music is not innovation.
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:15.940]   They're playing catch up and they're not even doing it right.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:22.460]   So I'm guessing that the fact that it increased the match limit on Apple iTunes match to 100,000
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:24.300]   tracks is not going to change your.
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.300]   I don't care.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.420]   But I want them to fix the problems.
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:28.420]   Yeah, I think it works.
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:30.740]   And you know, I think it's like 100 tracks, right?
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:32.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.020]   Get 10 tracks, right?
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:41.820]   I mean, we're five months into this and I can't even add music to the library.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:47.780]   And keep in mind that I'm not asking Apple Music to do anything that Apple didn't tell
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.100]   me it could do.
[02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:55.500]   I'm not saying that Apple should do this great, wonderful thing that it can't do.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:57.700]   They told me it could do this.
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:00.700]   I'm just asking it to do it and it can't.
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:04.980]   Did you see the Google podcast terms and conditions, Leo?
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:05.980]   Who cares?
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:06.980]   Why?
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:07.980]   What are they?
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:09.900]   They have the right to add post role to your video post role.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:10.900]   I shouldn't care less.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.340]   I don't, you know, I don't think anybody makes it to the end of our shows anyway.
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:17.700]   If they want to put an ad at the end there, God bless them more power.
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:18.700]   Is that true?
[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.860]   Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:24.700]   We're testing that theory right now.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:25.860]   You can say anything you want.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   [MUSIC]
