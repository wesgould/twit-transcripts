[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.760]   our esteemed panel of Mac experts Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times is here.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   Hello Andrew.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.040]   Oh, you know how they're hoe there?
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.040]   Pretty blue.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.680]   Yes, I can like that.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.880]   It can also be pretty pretty.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   Red?
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.880]   Ooh.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.880]   Can it cycle?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.680]   Yeah, it can cycle.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680]   It can cycle.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   The only problem is that...
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.960]   It's a little fickery.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.240]   We had that problem with our cycling too.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   There's a solution to that.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.560]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.440]   It has to do with, I think you need a power cleaner.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.760]   Yeah, power supply.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.680]   We had the same problem, didn't we, on some of those LED lights?
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.360]   I don't, yeah, I don't, yeah, I was assuming that's because these are not really super
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.160]   expensive lights and whenever you don't, it has to do these combinations of colors through
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.560]   cycling on their own and it's just not enough for a full board.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   Yeah, Brent told me what was going on.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.800]   Brent by told me what was going on.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   It might be that actually.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   It might be the 60 Hertz.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   But the nice thing is...
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   But the nice thing is...
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   But the nice thing is...
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600]   If it's a shade of blue, the nice thing is, though it looks like I'm like, I've got a
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   reflecting pool of...
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   It's like I'm in like a...
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.240]   It's like I'm in like a quality in Western Massachusetts that they're trying to be more
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.480]   fancy than they have the budget for.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.080]   To me, it feels like you're in that tunnel in Chicago.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.920]   Ah, it's Adam mixed from Tippin.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.920]   Oh, Adam.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   Feeling it for an A-Rae.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.080]   Somewhere on assignment.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   He told us he'd be away.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.160]   But we're very glad to have Adam.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   And we're going to play the game now.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400]   We're in the world is Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.760]   Sometimes I just like to leave it up to you.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   You can be anywhere.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   See.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   I actually have to bring...
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   I took over last time, but I'm handing you the green screen to wish you will.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   You were...
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480]   You did some big streaming event recently.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.280]   I was in Berlin.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.440]   It turned out that there was a big streaming event out of Berlin.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.520]   There was a guy who runs a big social company.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.720]   So yeah, so we were in Berlin doing the Facebook thing.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   It was fun.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   It was fun.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   Did you see Colleen?
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   Colleen Kelly?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.360]   I did not.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.240]   She was managing it from the home front.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   She was on the studio.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.720]   They left me with...
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.880]   I just went over there with a little crew and some sat trucks.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   Somebody is streaming the house committee on the judiciary.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.200]   It's on YouTube live.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.440]   We were watching it earlier.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.480]   They've gone to recess in room 2141.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   But did you guys get to watch a little bit as we were streaming it?
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.320]   Yeah, it was last 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.440]   Your thoughts, anybody?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.600]   I'm glad to see that they're asking...
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   That there is opposition to any sort of a broad spectrum granting of powers to law enforcement.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.400]   Also I think that the FBI's responses, who are responding I believe, have also been...
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.360]   We haven't heard a single mention of 9/11 keeping people safe.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.320]   Your children, they're talking like law enforcement people as opposed to political people, which
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   is very encouraging.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.680]   You talked to someone who's had...
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   He was listening to only 20 minutes of it, but I was expecting to see cameras.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   Election year?
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   Yes, cameras.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920]   Right.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Adam, you had some thoughts?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah, I was going to say that I was...
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Same thing I was...
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.760]   Andy was saying I was pleased to see that they were...
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.080]   The questions were being appropriately critical.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   That they were not...
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   They were saying, "You know, but you say this is one phone, but how many phones do you
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.480]   have in lawful possession?"
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.720]   And the FBI director is just sort of refusing to answer, but he kind of comes down on the,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.480]   "Well, we have lots, but they're all different, but we still have lots."
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.320]   We know that Cyrus Vance Jr., the District Attorney of Manhattan said he has 145 that
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   he'd like to have unlocked.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.400]   Of course, also the line that I really, really liked, which is that when they're asking if
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.880]   are you seeking these broad, broad powers, I think almost a direct quote, "As we like
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   the system we have now where we have to go in front of a judge when we need these things
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   unlocked."
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   So that's not the end, I'll be all of the argument.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.920]   But like I said, what we're hoping for is...
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.880]   On a day when a lot of people are expecting Donald Trump to receive the Republican nomination
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   for presidency, we are hoping...
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.840]   We are grateful for a venue in which we see some rational talk with people who are wearing
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   suits, talking to microphones and a congressional anything.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   I will fight them.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.760]   It could be four to eight years away from seeing that again.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.560]   Now, come on, guys.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   Come on.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:18.040]   So some good news out of New York earlier yesterday, a Brooklyn magistrate gave Apple
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.440]   the ruling it wants to get in this other case, US Department of Justice trying to force Apple
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.120]   to provide the FBI with exactly the same thing, access to locked iPhone data.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.880]   In this case, it's a Brooklyn drug lord.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.720]   And the judge said no.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.400]   He was very unimpressed.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   He said not only do you say no, but he kind of...
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.600]   He said it reflects poorly on a government that exists in part to safeguard the freedom
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   of a citizen.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.640]   He said you can't use the All Rits Act.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.400]   It's too broad.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.280]   Ultimately, he wrote the question to be answered in this matter and in others like it across
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.760]   the country, nudge, nudge, is not whether the government should be able to force Apple
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.120]   to help it unlock a specific device.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   It is instead whether the All Rits Act resolves that issue and many others like it yet to
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   come.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.200]   I conclude it does not.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.400]   And I think that one of the things that we might start seeing get drummed up, and I
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.280]   think this is a reason that this case is very dangerous for the FBI, is that fundamentally
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.520]   the All Rits Act may start calling into question the All Rits Act itself.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.360]   And if they go down that path, they use that All Rits Act for a lot of things.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.960]   That's a very useful tool for them, but the fact that they're overusing it could end up
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.800]   with it getting pushed into the Supreme Court and with the right justices in place, you
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.960]   could see something that was written in 1789 and was used solidly for over 200 years,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.240]   get thrown out completely.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.080]   Because the problem really is if you go back to any kind of intention of the framers of
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.880]   that law, you would have to ask yourself if they would think it was a good idea, if they
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   had come into the future to be with us, if they would think it would be a good idea,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.280]   the people who wrote the Bill of Rights, the 10 things that we don't want the government
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.480]   to do to us, do we think that they would think it would be a good idea for the government
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.880]   to have all access to our phones?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   And I think that most of them would say over my dead body.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:27.520]   And so I think that when we get into intention, and I think that overuse of a very, very old
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   law, it may be time to put it away.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.880]   And this may be the act that gets it done, and that will be crippling for a lot of law
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.880]   enforcement.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.760]   And in my opinion, if they lose it, it's their own fault for overusing it.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.400]   The Brooklyn judge was very aware of the California case, of course, referred to it several times
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.920]   in his 50 page judgment and said things, I said something which I kind of think is the
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.080]   bottom line on this.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   He said, I'm not offering an opinion on whether the government's legitimate interest in ensuring
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.880]   that no door is too strong to resist lawful entry should prevail against the equally legitimate
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.960]   societal interest to rate against it here.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.600]   He said that's not for other courts to decide.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.760]   That's for Congress to decide.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   And I think that's right.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.240]   This hearing that we've been watching is so important as Congress tries to get its head
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.120]   around what encryption is, what it stops, what law enforcement thinks about it, and
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.720]   what breaking it might mean to public safety in general.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   That's Apple's position.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.760]   It's just too risky a thing to do.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.400]   Well, and I think that one of the fundamental issues for Apple is that once they break it,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.520]   if they're forced to break it, once they break it, it's not just that they could possibly
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.120]   open up this phone and then throw it away.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.840]   You end up with a series of a handful of engineers at Apple that understand what it takes to
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.000]   undo a phone.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   And I think Apple would prefer not to even generate that knowledge among a group of small
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.680]   people, not because they're distrustful, but because it really puts them at risk at that
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.480]   point, because there's a lot of people that want that back to that back door.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   And that's the issue.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.960]   Apple becomes a security vulnerability in its own right.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   And that's the goal.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.480]   Well, not just to abolish specifically the engineers working on it.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   So now you still look at it.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   Right.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   It's just it.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.880]   As you know, Apple becomes a large vulnerability and then all the way down into those particular
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.640]   people, it just keeps getting narrowed down to, you know, could they be corrupted?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   Could they be core?
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.520]   If they, you know, presumably they could write it still.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.560]   I mean, you know, that that that potential exists.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.040]   It's really important for people to understand a few things out of this one.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   Apple can and will and does willingly decrypt your iCloud backups.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.920]   So if you're backing up to iCloud, even if it's encrypted, Apple has the keys to that
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.520]   Apple apparently has the capability of writing firmware as and it's not Apple.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.840]   You make an excellent point.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.040]   Those whoever they are people are working at Apple right now have that capability.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.560]   Apple is the only one to consign it unless that key leaks out.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.160]   And that, you know, that exists.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.200]   But you know, it's not like the genie isn't out of the bottle.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.560]   I mean, it's a very important point made by ours.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.520]   Technica is that really there's a backdoor to everything as long as you have an update
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.400]   facility, as long as you can push updates to a phone, to a computer, to a tablet, you
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.320]   can push this kind of update to it that that bypass is encryption that waits, for instance,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.680]   till the user logs in the drive is unencrypted and then uploads its contents, you know, surreptitiously.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.320]   So we, that backdoor may not be written, but the potential for it to be written exists
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   anyway.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.440]   Yeah, I mean, in the sense that you can always with the right hammer and the right wrench,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.000]   you can take a part of machine and then put it back together to do things that was never
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   meant to do.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.840]   And that's pretty much what the government is trying to force Apple to do, which is to
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.680]   use a vulnerability using tools that only Apple has to bypass a piece of security that
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.040]   Apple has designed to be unbypassable.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.600]   It's I really there are some of the things that have been that kind of get overlooked
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.880]   in the political rhetoric of this is that, of course, as you say, Apple has said on their
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.760]   own that we have been helping law enforcement time and time again on case after case after
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   case.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.080]   The only time when we said no is when they asked us to write a custom piece of software
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.680]   that doesn't exist to do something that our phone was never meant to do, because that
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:34.320]   does open the door to open the door to all kinds of abuses where if the government can
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.640]   figure out that we think that it might be possible to use there might be data in force
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:48.320]   touch and unclear or an unperged buffer that might have some data on what areas of the
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.080]   screen have been pressed more often than others.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.360]   And on that hunch, we are going to force you now to write a piece of software that will
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.960]   purge every bit of data that might be in even a secure area that is not even available
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   to developers or even internal Apple developers.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.240]   The question is where does the where is this license to kill and for the government?
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.560]   What can they tell what can they tell?
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.600]   Can they not tell Apple or near their manufacturer to build for them?
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.880]   And are they willing to pull this trigger on cases of even lower stakes as opposed to
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.440]   ones where they could credibly say that maybe lives are at stake?
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Right.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.840]   I mean, it starts with a terrorist act that's being asked by the federal authorities and
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.480]   it's a drug act that's asked for the state authorities, then it's a traffic act that's
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.120]   asked by the local authorities.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.600]   And we're talking about it'll go from the iPhone to the Echo to your car to I mean,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.720]   an Internet of Things, it means that absolutely there's nowhere that safe if this passes.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.480]   I mean, this is the precedent that they are trying to establish is, and when we think
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.960]   about what this means, I think that we have to not think about the current government,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.520]   we have to think about, you know, if Jay Edgar Hoover had a hold of this tool and was
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.280]   able to hack into all every audio device and everything else, what would he do with it?
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.320]   Because there's, you know, we can't be guaranteed that that's not going to happen again or
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   it's not happening.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.880]   Well, and I think it's the big big bogeyman is what happens if foreign, foreign intelligence
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.200]   agencies or organized crime can then hack into it because once this thing gets out and
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.840]   it will get out, it, you know, once it can be used by local people, it can kind of get
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   out to the, to the mafia.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   There's just no question.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.280]   Well, I'm, you know, I was concerned, I'm less concerned about those people than about
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.400]   the government and I'm not someone who was generally, they came out the government as
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   my enemy.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   I mean, I'm not concerned.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.880]   I'm, I'm, I'm normally concerned about organized crime, finding back doors and finding security
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   weaknesses.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.640]   I'm more concerned about my government being able to command Apple to command Google to
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   command Facebook to introduce a vulnerability that's only exclusive to them.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.280]   More than that, excuse me, as same as that, I would also be concerned if they had the
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.600]   ability to say, let's, let's say that there is a known vulnerability in the Tor network
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.680]   or in some other system of encryption.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.320]   Does the government say that we have decided that this, we are now using this vulnerability
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.640]   to get into people's emails that they think is uncrackable and therefore we are deeming
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.520]   this technique to be a state secret.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.080]   Therefore, we know that you are planning as a researcher to, to expose this vulnerability
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   at a conference.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.960]   We are telling you that it is now under federal jurisdiction and you are banned from speaking
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.760]   of this because we want this vulnerability to stay open as long as possible.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.480]   It's, it's, it's a, we talked about this last week, it's still relevant.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.960]   I, I find myself as I'm writing down my thoughts.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.880]   It's very illustrative to see how closely a lot of these arguments that I'm making that
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.720]   are very sincerely, and I think very rationally held, track with the arguments that a lot of
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.400]   people make against gun control because you would think, well, it's a simple thing, isn't
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   it?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.200]   If you, if, if there's a criminal that has the ability to do a lot of damage to society
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   as a whole, why are we, why are we even worried about breaking into this, this person's phone
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.680]   and their computer to compromise their communications?
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.920]   And now here I am talking about, well, what if the government wants to put it in the
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.640]   computer restriction 10 years down the line on the ability to even close technical loopholes?
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.240]   What if they're going to simply start to say that every, every sufficiently powerful tech
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.280]   company is now sufficiently important to their ability to, to conduct surveillance that they
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   are going, they can be deputized into law enforcement at any time.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.200]   And that's not that far on the nut scale.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.800]   That's not too far removed from ideas that I would have a year ago thought our, my goodness,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.960]   why are these people so irrational about gun control?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.480]   It's, it's such a, this just shows you what a, what a sticky, sticky, big ball of problems
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   that this whole issue is.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.240]   That's why we're still talking about it two or three weeks later.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.440]   Well, we're going to be talking about it for a long time because I think it's pretty
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.000]   clear what's going to happen here.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.080]   Winter lose the case will continue to the US Supreme Court.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.480]   And at, and at that point I'm, I'm thinking if the court just accepts the case, which
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.640]   they ought to, because it really, as you say, Alex, it's about all Ritz and how broad and
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.680]   there's a lot of things that the Supreme Court could sink its teeth into.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   I, I would expect that they would throw it back in the lap of Congress.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.280]   I think ultimately these are the arguments that are going to be in front of Congress
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.000]   and Congress is going to have to decide whether it wants to on the one hand make Kalia to,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.240]   you know, Kalia, which was passed in the early 90s is a law that says telecommunications companies
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.880]   have to provide wiretap access to all communications to law enforcement period.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.240]   That's what Kalia says.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.600]   But it only covers your cell company and your phone company.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.080]   Kalia too, which has been proposed in the past and rejected by Congress, by the way,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.280]   would force Apple and other digital companies to do the same.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   Not unprecedented.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.560]   I could see them doing that.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.040]   Or maybe you get a smart Congress that understands the peril of that.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.120]   And as we said last week, the real debate is should the contents of your phone be protected
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.520]   or not from all and you can't have protected.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.200]   So it has to be protected from all and sundry or enemies foreign and domestic or no one.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.560]   And I think that fundamentally it will most likely by the time it gets the Supreme Court,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.960]   it'll have to go to Congress because my guess is by WWDC or by the end of the year, at least
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.280]   Apple will probably provide tools that cut the phone off even from them.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.840]   I mean, I think that they're, you know, they're just going to, you know, this is this whole
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.680]   thing, but you know, by the time this gets sorted out, Apple will have closed all the
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   doors that are.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.040]   You can't, by the way, you can't.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.360]   And this is Apple is, yeah, supposedly working on an unbreakable phone.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:49.000]   As long as there's a mechanism for automated updates, you can push an update onto a phone
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   that breaks it.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.560]   That and the FBI knows that.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.240]   That's what they're asking me to do today.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.560]   But the question is, is whether they flip a switch that takes away automated updates.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.560]   What would that be?
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.520]   Then you would, does Apple want, which is the bigger security problem, a phone that is never
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   updated?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.880]   Well, it doesn't have any never updated.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.640]   It would be a manual update.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.080]   So the, you know, that would be the right.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:18.920]   I mean, worthwhile scenario to go through is how you would make a phone completely secure.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:25.200]   One way to do is to make it very inconvenient, which is to build an encryption, strong encryption,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.040]   that requires a long, strong password.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.000]   You know, the front door is the problem here that four digit passcode is weak.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.680]   But what if you had an error, a 16 character, alpha numeric, every time you unlock the phone,
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.160]   that make it more secure?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.560]   You still have that problem with updates.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.840]   So then you say, okay, let's say updates are optional and have to be approved by the
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.640]   user and the user has to enter in.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   Oh, I got it.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.880]   Has to enter in their passcode.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.320]   They're a long, strong, unknowable passcode that Apple doesn't have access to.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.160]   You think Apple's going to do that?
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.000]   I think I could see it becoming an option, you know, just like you could encrypt, you
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.880]   know, some of the data on your drive.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   It's not something that we all use.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.400]   But I think that it's something that for people who feel like they wanted to do it, Apple
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.960]   could put something in there that would allow them to-
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.760]   That's kind of where we stand now, which is if you're sophisticated enough and willing
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.840]   to put up with the inconvenience and you have something to hide, you can do it.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Right.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   And I think-
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.520]   And this is what Apple's fighting the fight for.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.200]   And Tim Cook was very clear in the ABC interview.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.360]   Bad guys can hide their communications if they want.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   This is for the normal person who doesn't want to go through the inconvenience.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.560]   See, I think Apple's kind of stuck here.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.920]   Because if they build in that kind of thing that they're just saying, we're making a
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.280]   special phone for terrorists.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.040]   But I think that the issue is that the bigger issue is really the precedent.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   It's not whether it's Apple.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   It's not whether it's an iPhone.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.920]   It's not whether it's a terrorist act.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.120]   It really is.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.680]   If the government's allowed to compel a private company to develop a new-
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   Oh, I agree with you.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.080]   There's hardware and software.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   There is no limit to how where this can go.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.600]   And that's what the Brooklyn judge was very clear about is this is an undue burden on
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   Apple.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.800]   You can't require Apple to do this, period.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.880]   I mean, that was the first thing in the judgment.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:19.720]   But I think it would be a mistake to think that you could make a completely private phone
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.520]   without making it a very inconvenient phone to use that no one would want to use.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.320]   Yeah, and I think it depends on, you know, because if you move into more biometrics and
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.880]   so on and so forth, the amount of times you, like I don't interact with my code that often,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.240]   which is why I've chosen to make it after this made it a little longer.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.680]   You know, so, but it's-
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.800]   But you're trusting the fingerprint reader and that the fingerprint reader doesn't have
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.040]   a back door.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.840]   Yes, no, absolutely.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.640]   Which I think it probably does.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.320]   It's really just a matter of, I mean, I think that in many ways it's a matter of reducing
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   the ability to do it.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.880]   And obviously it's given that the government is trying to hack into it and our government
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.760]   is pretty sophisticated when it comes to hacking.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.400]   It obviously is a relatively good, you know, pretty good protection.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.680]   I feel like there's a lot of theater going on right now and that we may not really know
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.840]   what's going on.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   Well, it's-
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.160]   This is all because of the lack of specific direction that's been offered by the law,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   but exactly.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.640]   The reason why I use the All-Rich Act is because there is not a law that's currently
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.560]   in place and the reason why law enforcement at the case level, not at the bureau level,
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.240]   not at the political level, the reason why law enforcement is trying to pressure Apple
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.560]   into doing this is because there is no legal definition of what limits they have to rights
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.600]   to personal and private information.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.880]   And so lacking that guidance, of course, they're going to go for however much the data they
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.840]   think they're going to need in order to move forward in their goal.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   And more is always better.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.240]   Yeah, the more data they can get, the better.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.600]   Because they never quite know what they're going to want it for.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:11.840]   And so I think a lot of the problem here for those of us who are seeing it as this specific
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.880]   phone is it doesn't seem like there's that much information that could be on it, that
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   could be useful.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.440]   I mean, they destroy different phones.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.360]   There's 18 minutes, blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.880]   This isn't about this phone.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   You know that.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   Precisely, that's my point.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.960]   It's not about this phone.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.400]   It's about being able to get this information in general.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   That's exactly the whole idea.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.080]   Interesting article on "In Slate" by Michael Noah Smith saying, "The FBI isn't asking to
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.600]   access an uncrackable safe.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   It wants to compromise the boundaries of the self.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.120]   The iPhone is an extension of your mind."
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.720]   I mean, I see why law enforcement wants to get into these phones.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.960]   They really are magical treasure troves of information that could be used in many, many
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   situations.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.720]   And my question, I guess my fundamental question is, is it possible to secure these?
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.040]   Do people use such a phone?
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.960]   In other words, could the normal average Joe be assured that his phone is private?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.600]   And of course, Congress is going to answer the question, should law enforcement have
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.200]   some form of access to those phones?
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.480]   And can that be done without compromising public safety?
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.440]   Well, and I think the-
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   So there's two questions.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.880]   And I think that it's also, you know, how does it compromise, you know, business, not
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.440]   just Apple's business, but all business?
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.240]   Yeah, extend public safety to include the economy.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   Right.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.760]   So the issue is that the fallout from the Snowden documents has already caused all kinds of
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.040]   damage for cloud-based companies.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.840]   If it gets to a point where no one feels like anything is safe in the United States, we
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.480]   can be pretty much guaranteed that almost all data will move out of the United States.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.920]   You know, move out of the jurisdiction that's going to allow that.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.200]   I mean, by law, probably in most of these other countries.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.560]   I mean, it's just a question for me.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.160]   Is it possible to make a consumer-friendly phone that is secure?
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   No.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.520]   I don't think so.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.480]   No, and the other thing that we're overlooking is that if- no matter what I've done to protect
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.440]   my phone or my data, if I've secured it so that I can get that data out so long as I
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   am alive, the government and law enforcement has yet, they have extra tools against me.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.160]   They're not going to start putting pressure on Apple.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.840]   They're going to put more pressure on me.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.480]   And they're going to basically- no matter how good my lawyers are, they're going to
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.120]   find a way to make it much, much, much more attractive for me to unlock that phone for
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.960]   them or to get a court to force me to unlock it for them rather than to try to take on
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.000]   a company that has $230 billion in cash somewhere.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.280]   And I think also, you know, this gets back a little bit to the concept of self is that
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   for the most part, what's in a phone is communicated.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.120]   And so by definition, those communications had to take place over some space, over some
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.520]   transmission medium, and there's someone else on the other side of it.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.600]   So that does tend to hurt the self concept a little bit.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.040]   It's not like you're just talking to your phone and it's, you know, it's you and your
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.680]   phone and you're making notes to yourself about how you're going to blow up the Brooklyn
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   Bridge.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.960]   Well, you might- let's say you're scouting a location for planning a bomb and you're
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.640]   taking pictures of that location.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.400]   Those are private communications that would be of great interest.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.000]   I'm just saying it can't happen, but I'm just saying that-
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.400]   Some of it's public, but not all of it.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.760]   Well, not public, but at least multi-party.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.800]   And my point is if it's not 100% secure, then law enforcement will always have a way
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   in.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:45.960]   So really, all we can do, all we can hope for is Congress to say, all right, you could
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.280]   compel this FBI, but we forbid it.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   I-
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.080]   Which hasn't been that effective in the past when it comes to the NSA.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   The NSA is on law.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.360]   How many of the NSA's activities, according to Snowden, are unlawful?
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.880]   Because partly because they're perpetrated against American citizens.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:15.240]   So really, if you're going to be, you know, real politic, you can't secure a phone and
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.720]   there's no way government is going to not take advantage of the phone.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.160]   So almost all of this is moot.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   Congress can do what it wants.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   The courts can do what they want.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.260]   Apple can do what they want.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.120]   If you're carrying a smartphone, you're carrying, you know-
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.560]   But again, the government is not the only actor here.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.040]   No, but I'm just saying you can't-
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   Yes.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   Well, precisely.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:44.840]   So if there's always a backdoor and no law can stop government or bad actor or the mafia,
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.880]   I don't understand what anybody is proposing.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.400]   What is the proposal to protect the-
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.920]   We're assuming that Apple's encryption isn't good enough to stop the foreign intelligence
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   agencies and organized crime and whatnot.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.360]   No, his encryption is fine, but there's a backdoor already.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.880]   But that backdoor is not available.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.080]   I mean, if that backdoor has been available since day one, it's widely believed, according
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.240]   to Snowden, that there are zero days against the iPhone that NSA has.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   Yeah, but there's a difference between a backdoor and a security vulnerability that's hard
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.480]   to get around.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   But it exists.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.200]   It's not that anybody can just walk right into a phone.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.120]   If that were true, then I don't think the FBI would bother forcing Apple to do anything.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.600]   This definitely identifies something that the FBI does not have the capability of.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.480]   Well, that's where the theater, my theater supposition comes in.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.640]   I think I'll leave that on the table as a possibility of a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.040]   I don't see any data that could point to that right now.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.280]   But I think that you do have to be broad-minded enough to imagine that.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.600]   In fact, actually, there was in the New York case, the Judge Ornstein actually, one of
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:02.520]   the criteria in which he threw out or denied the government's motion was that the government
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.160]   had first said, "We can break into the phone, the drug, the traffic, or phone."
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.200]   Then they said, "No, we can't break into the drug, traffic, or phone."
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.120]   And then third, they said, "Well, maybe we can, but maybe if we did it wrong, we'd
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.600]   erase the whole thing and that's too dangerous."
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.280]   And the Judge basically said, "You've got to figure out your story because it is unreasonable
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.400]   to be asking Apple to do anything when you don't even know what your situation is."
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.920]   So the government used to be able to do some of this stuff.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.800]   I forget it was iPhone box.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.840]   There was some hacking forensics tool that could get through earlier iPhones in certain
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.280]   ways and things like that.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.720]   And so some of this has been possible in the past, but is increasingly no longer possible.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.920]   And so that's, I think, one of the confusions.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.880]   But if the FBI could just do it, then, again, they wouldn't be asking Apple.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:53.360]   Well, and I think that the fundamental case against the idea that this is all theater
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.800]   and they're trying to actually make people think that the phone is secure by losing a
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.080]   case where they say they can't get in.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.320]   I think that the fundamental issue with that is that generally the government is just not
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   that smart.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.360]   You mean like, "Direct your Comey is not coming off that smart in his test."
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   I agree.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.080]   But remember, the director of the FBI is a political person.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   Right.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   He's an appointee.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.920]   He's not the real administrator.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:27.960]   Well, and I think the more plausible conspiracy theory is that the fact that they changed the
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:34.600]   passcode for the iCloud means that they either purposely wanted to make this a case or they're
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   incompetent.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   You know, so that-
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   No.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   Or-
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   No.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.200]   There's some scenarios you can see where they thought that was a good idea.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.920]   Remember that this was not owned by the person that committed these crimes.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.320]   It's owned by their employer.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.040]   And the logical reason for them to do this thing that screwed them royally was that,
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.320]   what if there's another person out there who has that password?
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.380]   Would they be able to remote wipe the phone?
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.240]   We need to take control over this iTunes account to make sure that whatever data is
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.560]   on that phone can stay intact.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.120]   There's been a lot of Michigoss about who made that request or who made that order.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.600]   But that's not a smoking gun about anything.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.040]   I'm going to say it one more time and then I'm going to drop it.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.480]   But I think this is all completely moot because of two things.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.640]   One, it's impossible, in my opinion, to make a secure phone that is usable by normal people.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.160]   And that's who we want to protect because terrorists and bad guys, where sufficient
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.360]   sophistication can do this, you know, anyway.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.320]   So we want to make it so that somebody who's just walking down the street has a private
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   phone.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.760]   I would submit one, it's not possible to do that.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.280]   And two, that while you might have, and I hope you will have Congress pass a law saying
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.200]   this is not, you know, don't go after this and the courts seem to agree so far and probably
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   will continue to agree.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.840]   It doesn't even matter because of unlawful actors, not only in government outside of government
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.080]   who will take advantage of these flaws.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.640]   And so to me, it's a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.200]   And the takeaway, I'll finish, I'm going to say one thing and then, and then, please,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200]   you can shoot me down.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.240]   But the takeaway, in my opinion is you're nuts to think you can carry a smartphone and use
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.320]   it and that it's private.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   Period.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   I'm done.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.680]   I'm not a mic drop, just a galaxy, I said.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.280]   All I'll say is that the most important part about all of this is to create a brand new
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.720]   broad based principle that hopefully will inform future legislation.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.400]   I talked about this in Greater Dutch last week, but again, I'll repeat it.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:45.160]   It's all about does a private citizen have the right to have a secret that the government
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   cannot get at.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.480]   God, I hope so.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.720]   And that's, and that's really all there is to it.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.000]   They can create all kinds of scenarios in which here are the scenarios in which we can
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.280]   compel you to give testimony here are the scenarios in which we can compel you to hand
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.480]   stuff over.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:03.740]   But the moment that some of these political statements being that it is not proper, it
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:09.560]   is not right for the law enforcement to not be able to get into a safe that exists, that's
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:16.120]   when you start saying that any piece of information that I have is partly owned by the government
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   that that towers over me.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.040]   And I should have the ability to take this receipt and toss it into a fire if I want
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.640]   to toss it into a fire.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.800]   The ability when they tell me that if you decided to burn your old receipts, that means
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.520]   those receipts must produce something bad.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.280]   And therefore, we're going to basically force you not to burn them anymore.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   That's when we lose a big big analogy.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.400]   It's really hard to make a home that can't be broken into.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.640]   So we make laws and we make glocks, which are not, by the way, locks are very ineffective.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.280]   They're suggestions and they establish a border so that the law can say if you cross
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.880]   that border, then you've broken the law.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.880]   That's really the purpose.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.360]   Your lock doesn't do anything.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.720]   I mean, that's obvious to anybody who's thinking about it.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.800]   And I would suggest it's similar with a phone, but I would also say that, you know, and we
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.600]   should have laws that say that the lock phone is locked and no one has any right to go into
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.040]   it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:18.120]   We should prosecute the mafia or the government if they do break those serving suggestions
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.000]   and get into the phone.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.600]   But it's also, I would say, important for us to understand.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.080]   And I guess the bottom line is that that's all, you know, kind of theater.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   Like this is the law.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   Don't break the law.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.720]   But people will and can.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.980]   So remember that.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.760]   And what it really boils down to is screw it.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.560]   Just use your fingerprint reader and a six-digit passcode and not worry so much because the
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.960]   truth is it's penetrable.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.080]   And the only thing that's protecting you is custom.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.560]   Well, and I think that it is, you know, the reason that the ruling is important, of course,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.400]   is that it's a difference between it being used at certain points and it being rampant.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.560]   You know, so I think that it is not, you know, when we decide that there's a law that says
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.720]   we're not going to, you know, that we can, you know, you can't break into it, it means
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.080]   that maybe the NSA is going to continue to do what it's going to do.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.360]   We other actors will continue to do that process and obviously keep on working down that path.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.760]   But it means that, you know, local law enforcement, you know, is not going to be, you know, using
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.200]   it to catch up on your, you know, your parking tickets, which, you know, is the, is where
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.520]   this goes in 10 years if we allow it to go here, you know, and so.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.000]   So just that's what the conversation really is about though.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.800]   It's not about this, whether you can break in.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.080]   It's not a technical conversation.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   It's a policy conversation.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.480]   It's where you want the laws to say stop.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.320]   You can't go past that.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.480]   And an apple does, an apple is pushing hard and it going to Congress.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.480]   Tim Cook has said that repeatedly.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.600]   And I think that's, that's, that's the right place to send.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.920]   It's about policy.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.320]   As long as people don't misunderstand and think that it's about real security.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   It's not.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.520]   It's about policy in the same way that we have laws against burglary.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.320]   It's about policy.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.080]   And I think that, I think that Apple also knows that the, that the appetite for Congress
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:10.640]   to dig too deeply into this is probably pretty low given the SOPA and PIPA conversation.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.320]   You know, I have a feeling that that they're probably not really going to, especially in
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.560]   election year, aren't going to want to do it.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.680]   Probably aren't going to want to do it at all.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.000]   You know, this is, I think that it will be, that's my guess is that, that this is probably
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.240]   going to be a dead end for the, for the FBI.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:33.120]   By the way, Apple has just hired the guy behind Signal, which is an excellent secure encrypted
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   messaging service.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:40.680]   It's one Edward Snowden said everybody should use and Frederick Jacobs is now going to work
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.400]   for the core OS security team at Apple.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.360]   He says this summer, which sounds like it might be like an internship.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   Oh, it is.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.520]   It's an inter, how old is this guy?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   Oh my God.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   Unpaid internship.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.600]   Just here to get college credits.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.040]   I've tried to get my resume together.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   But that's good.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   I mean, that's good.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.040]   Apple's paying attention to this.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.320]   They need a secure, I mean, messages should be secure.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.000]   We don't really know how messages works.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.960]   Apple hasn't been very forthright in that.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   But they have done good things in security.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.240]   And some of the hypocrisy here, of course, is also that, that our own government builds
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.960]   tools for, for pro, you know, resistors within, you know, we've built tools with resistors
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.040]   within countries we don't agree with so that they can anonymously communicate back to the
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040]   United States.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.800]   You know, like, you know, this is not a, you know, so we're trying to take it away.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.080]   The government is monolithic on this.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.320]   The NSA has said time and time again, everybody needs strong end-end encryption.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   Right.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:40.600]   That, I mean, there's not, and even within the NSA, there seems to be division on that.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   Right.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.800]   So, no, I agree there.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.320]   This is a debate and it's, is a appropriate debate for this time, frankly.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.240]   And we have to solve it now because otherwise, how will we know what policies to put in place
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.040]   for the cycore once the, the we have teleports?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.120]   So, you know, I'm just to be clear.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.000]   Apple has lost a case against Samsung, more court news.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.400]   I'm, I'm a court news about the most boring you can have.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:10.480]   But this is interesting because Apple sued Samsung over three patents, slide to unlock,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   auto correct.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.440]   And I can't remember what the third one.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.560]   Oh, detecting when a series of numbers can be dialed, you know, clicking the numbers in
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   a text to make a phone call.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.200]   Two of those patents in this case.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.640]   So the Apple won the jury awarded Apple $120 million of Samsung's money.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.920]   Samsung appealed.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.960]   The three judge panel has now said not only that they reversed that award, they said,
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.120]   you know what, those first two patents aren't really any good.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.760]   We, we're going to overturn those.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.960]   Slide to unlock an auto correct.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.560]   You know, I kind of have to say I agree.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   Slide to unlock.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560]   It's pretty darn obvious.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.880]   And of course, Apple is right to pursue and protect its patents.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.880]   These things happen.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:02.440]   Apple said today's decision is a, wait a minute, Samsung said, today's decision is a win for
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   consumer choice.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   It puts competition backwards.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   Well, I could have been any either of them, depending on who won.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.000]   Apple declined to comment.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.160]   But you know, they just showed you software patents.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.680]   They're just sucky to begin with.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.920]   I think this lawsuit has become self-aware and it's now impossible to kill.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:24.280]   Although the big one, the billion dollar judgment was not on, was on trade dress was
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.680]   that a Samsung copied the look of the iPhone.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.440]   And that one, as far as I know, Samsung still owes them the money.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.000]   Have they written the check yet?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Well, here we go.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   March now was March 15th.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Now it's March 21st.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.120]   We're going to talk about, take a break.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:48.040]   And then when we come back, talk about Apple's event and some of the things, some of the rumors,
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.560]   knowing that they're just rumors, meaningless rumors, but it's fun to repeat them since
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   we have nothing else to talk about.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.200]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.320]   Blue Apron is an amazing thing for people who like to cook, but don't want to shop.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.000]   I mean, I like to shop shopping.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.360]   It's really fun, but shopping is one of those things that could take time, you know?
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:16.720]   I imagine myself in the Sunday marketplace, squeezing melons, haggling with vendors, is
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   that tomato ripe?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.480]   And in fact, it's usually it's the end of the day you're going home, you're exhausted.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.200]   You know, you got to make dinner and you don't have anything in the refrigerator.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.360]   That's when I'm so happy my eyes light up and I get home and I see the Blue Apron box
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:38.040]   waiting for me inside three different recipes, six meals total, delicious, everything's fresh,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   just the right ingredients.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:44.280]   You don't need anything because it's all in there and there's no waste because it's
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.760]   all in there, but no more and the recipe card and it's stuff you probably would never
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:54.040]   think of using or making and you learn these new ingredients, these new recipes and people
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.960]   are impressed and everybody's happy.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's wonderful and it's for less than $10 a meal.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.680]   The meats and fish too always fresh.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.240]   The box is refrigerated.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.360]   They time it with your schedule.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.960]   You can look at the menus, proposed menus and change them, they can make them the way you
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:15.240]   know, your served dietary, very dietary needs, including vegetarian absolutely.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.760]   Every meal is a joy to prepare less than 40 minutes and because you don't have to go
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.080]   to the grocery store here, you're cooking and eating within an hour of getting home and
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.040]   no, no more sad takeout.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.320]   Come on, that's not good for you.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:34.360]   How about a dobo style chicken with roasted bok choy and jasmine rice tonight?
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.360]   How about that?
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.200]   Something a little vegetarian on your list?
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:45.360]   How about baked jerk tofu and smashed plantains with garlic ginger collard greens?
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.440]   Now, I'll tell you what, I always want to use collard greens, but man, cooking them is
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   hard.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.720]   This will teach you and now the next time you're in the store and you see collard greens, you
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   go, I know how to do that.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.280]   I can make them delicious.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.600]   You'll be using ingredients you've never seen or tried like watermelon radishes or
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.760]   pharaoh, we discovered a new bok choy, I wish you could remember the name, but it was wonderful.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.520]   It was a five spice Taiwanese chicken.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.280]   It was so good.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:18.520]   My mouth waters when I do these recipes, I think of the recipes I've made from Blue Apron.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.000]   You know what, I got two meals free for you.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.200]   Why don't you just try it?
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.480]   Okay, go to Blue Apron.com/twit.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   Check out the week's menu.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.720]   When you pick out your first two meals, it's free.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   Blue Apron.com/twit.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.520]   Then you'll see what I'm talking about.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.520]   By the way, they have plans for two, which is nice, great for date night.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   If you want to impress a certain someone, man, they'll be impressed.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.160]   But they also have family plans with kid-friendly ingredients.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   So check it out, Blue Apron.com/twit.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.640]   So, it was going to be March 15th.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Now it's March 21st.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.040]   I don't know what to believe with.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040]   Oh, supposedly.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   It's all made up first.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.920]   There's been no invitation sent out, have there?
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.920]   Not to knowledge.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.400]   No.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.640]   Not to my knowledge, but I would never.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.200]   Not to week I would know anyway.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.720]   See, that's particularly fine for me because there were a lot of people.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.520]   The Yosemite Conference at actually Yosemite National Park is the week of the 15th.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   Oh, good.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   And I'm giving that to Elmer.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   I'm going to be there.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   You're going?
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   You're going to be there.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   You're halfway there.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.240]   What is the Yosemite Conference?
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.440]   You did that last year, right?
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.800]   It's a great conference that takes place at Yosemite National Park.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   Nice.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.920]   And so thank God that Apple didn't change the name of the latest version to, you know,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.880]   like World Trash Dump North Dakota.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880]   Long Beach.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.640]   Oh, is the Yosemite Conference a Mac conference named after the Yosemite version of OS X?
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:55.520]   Yeah, it's a conference where it's less about, here's how to maximize your cable modem
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.680]   throughput.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.560]   It's more about people who are very active and very visible in the Mac community talking
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.760]   about larger issues about productivity and life and direction of their company in Apple
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.320]   and all these other sort of things.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.000]   It's basically a week-long TED at the one of the most beautiful state parks in the entire
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.720]   country and also good food and a lot of thoughtful stuff to think about and hear about.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.680]   Well, I will be talking about cows, unfortunately.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   You know what?
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.560]   That might explain why they moved it from the 15th to the 21st.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.200]   It was all about Yosemite.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.160]   I doubt it, but a lot of people would have had to.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.760]   That's interesting.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   That's interesting.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   Apple's never done things around press before, so I somehow doubt that they let was part
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   of it.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.400]   Well, you know, it's a new Apple.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.760]   It would have been a prove that you love me.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.160]   Cancel your trip to Yosemite.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.520]   And you're already halfway to California.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.880]   It's a natural more than halfway.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880]   You're almost to California.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.000]   And isn't Yosemite in California?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.800]   You're in California.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.240]   I think it's Yellowstone.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.440]   I was thinking of Yellowstone.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   Jellystone park.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   We're going to be the bareace.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.680]   The other thing is, of course, we thought there was going to, I think this is safe to say
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.840]   there'll be a new iPad.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:19.040]   But now the rumor is not Air 3, but iPad Pro mini or whatever.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.640]   Oh, iPad Pro.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   9.7 inch iPad.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.600]   And the reason that's good is as you were begging, pleading, wishing, dreaming for Alex
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.640]   Lindsay, it will have a pencil.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   I think this will be great.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.360]   I mean, I think I'll be more likely to use this one than the iPad Pro that I have now,
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   which I think is great.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.480]   I think the iPad Pro is a, I've really grown to love using it, which is I had kind of stopped
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.560]   using iPads in general.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.280]   It just just weren't really with the pen and, and, and, and with all the other tools, I
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   think it's actually become, you know, I actually built an entire presentation where I was
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.080]   over the, over the last couple of days where when I was sketching out ideas, I had my pen
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.320]   and I could build it in keynote and I had a, I, and I was split screening with notes and
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.920]   I draw, I draw a little, draw a little what I want to do later, like plan it and then
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.640]   simply copy it and put it into keynote.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.160]   And it was all touch and draw and touch and draw and it was, I was like, okay, that's
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.320]   exactly what I wanted.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.440]   It's just still, it's still a little big.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.480]   So having a smaller one will be fantastic.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.040]   It's a lot, it's a lot more practical than the 13 inch iPad Pro.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.920]   I still, I showed someone the first experience with the iPad Pro in the flesh last night
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.120]   and they couldn't get over my God, like how, it's just a huge iPad.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.120]   How do you deal with it?
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.880]   Having this huge iPad.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.640]   I had to say, well, if you'd like to use it as a primary device, I think there are a
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.760]   lot of people who just want to use, like the size of the 9.7 inch iPad, they just wish
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.880]   that it were more useful.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.680]   And Apple pencil is definitely something that makes it a lot more useful.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.120]   What makes it pro so many of the chair, I'm saying, well, the pencil is one, four speakers
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:02.440]   is another lack of the new processor, which makes it agile enough to do like multi layer
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:09.400]   Photoshop style graphics, makes it easy to do a 4K video, makes it, it's just, it's,
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.640]   it's the iPad Air CPU was good enough so that if you're doing mostly pushing text and numbers
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.400]   around, it was adequate.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.640]   But this takes it to a brand new level.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:25.720]   It really is desktop class and desktop speed software, given that these are apps that have
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.560]   been written specifically for a mobile environment.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:37.120]   Of course, good news, the new beta of 9.3, which just came out as restored, the navigation
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.800]   capability among the wrong article, Jason has restored the navigate.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.880]   Nice of you to show that, but that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.640]   Then restored the navigation features of the Apple pencil.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.600]   That was something they took out for a few versions, but there were certainly a human
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.120]   cry, the fact that you could use it to scroll or tap buttons and things like that.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   What else?
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.640]   So it's better processor for speakers.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.240]   You don't get 3D touch because you, you know, the pencil.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   Right.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.120]   Yes, it's better camera is another rumor I saw.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.720]   One rumor is 12 megapixel camera, like the same camera that you'll have on the iPhone
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   6.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.920]   See, I was saying they should do that with the pro because that's what pro means to me.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   Well, I'm not really sure because how many people are really, it'd be nice to have a
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:35.440]   better camera just for whatever reason, but it's such an, I mean, I have no problem walking
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:42.000]   around looking like this, but even I like what the kind of weird pictures like that.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.840]   But it's not just, but the 4K video is actually more interesting.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.020]   I think you're alone, by the way, in that concern because I see so many people using
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   chanked apples.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.660]   Yeah, I just say you go to school events and people don't know.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.660]   I know.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.660]   Isn't it horrible?
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.820]   I can't see my kid.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.600]   I think 4K video is a much, much bigger deal because you do have a CPU that is capable
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.900]   of editing multiple 4K video streams and to and cutting stuff together.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.280]   So there are so many producers that actually are perfectly happy with filming the entire
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.620]   thing on an iPad, cutting it on that iPad and then shipping it right from their train
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.620]   station.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.620]   It's so cool.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.100]   And I think that the interesting thing about 4K is that once you start having cameras that
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.700]   are capturing 4K, it leads you to believe that at some point the Apple TV is going to support
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.340]   the videos that were caught by that.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.900]   It seems like it may not be this hardware, but it seems like it'll be one soon.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.900]   One problem people were bringing up is, okay, if you have the smart connector, you now have
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.380]   a 9.7 inch tablet.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.060]   What do you do about the keyboard?
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.700]   Is it going to be big and then, you know, that would be ugly?
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.220]   Or is it going to be squunched?
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.180]   And then the keys are tiny and hard to use.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.460]   What do we do with the keyboard?
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.220]   I bet they make a smaller version of the smart cover that they have.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:50:00.780]   People have been happy enough using compact keyboards for the 9.7 inch iPad Air.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:04.220]   So I don't think that they would have any difficulty creating that.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:09.060]   Also, that's it's also not to say that someone, a third party can come up with something clever,
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.660]   like like the in case origami case, which I could imagine them coming up with something
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:21.860]   that folds down and looks like just a really cool, just looks like a really cool full-sized
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   keyboard cover.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.700]   So it's just folds down over it and looks like that.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:31.540]   But then you flip it over, flip two tabs behind it and expose a connector on the back
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.540]   there.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.900]   And now you can basically just drop it in there and have what you're going.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.300]   It's all about what they're going to.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:42.180]   I think they tend to make a statement with the accessories that they make for themselves
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:47.700]   and they do that with the understanding that if they are liberal enough in allowing people
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:54.260]   into the MFI program, if there's a need for a full-sized keyboard on a 9.7 inch iPad,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.220]   someone's going to go out there and make it.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.540]   Think different trademark is being updated, which is good.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.580]   I haven't seen a think different campaign in a long time, of course, that was the campaign
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.500]   that brought Steve Jobs back to Apple in 1997.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:17.180]   News to the crazy ones and all of that, apparently they have now refiled in Europe and they've
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:25.140]   expanded it to eight classes of product, including watches, Apple Pay, Apple Pencil, iPad, games,
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.460]   business management, subscription services, telecommunications, broadcasting, music, television,
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.180]   educational services and Siri.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:37.980]   So if you're thinking about using the words, think different, think again.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.980]   Apple.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.260]   They're their own plans to use it, how much of it is knowing that how closely think different
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.860]   is associated with Apple and just making sure that no one can use it.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   They haven't used it.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.740]   I mean, when's the last time you saw a think different campaign?
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.740]   It's been quite a while.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.740]   Ages.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.100]   Still, it should belong to Apple.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   That's theirs.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.940]   I think we should expand some older, other older campaigns so we could have on a Mac, on
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.940]   a PC, on an iPad, on an iPhone.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   I would like to see that.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940]   I don't have to watch.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.460]   I think you could go all out.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.820]   Apple's been around long enough now that the ads can now be nostalgia.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.020]   You know, like the Chevy Corvette ads, you know, you can start to think about the old
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.740]   days, you know, the Dodge brothers and all that.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.300]   You can have the actors come back as the older versions.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   The Touss T.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.100]   That was pretty funny.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.020]   John Hodgman is on the Colbert show, a Colbert show a week ago saying that, well, of course,
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.140]   I used to be the spokesman.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.180]   I'm ready to do that again.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.180]   I still have the suit.
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.180]   I still have the tie.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.180]   Call me.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.180]   And the ry-affect.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:45.500]   Has anybody tried the betas of, you know, these new betas of iOS and watch OS?
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.620]   And I think this kind of, the fact that they're really ramping this up, what are they on the
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:55.620]   fifth beta of iOS 9.3 or sixth, fifth, means that we're getting close.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.100]   That's why that March 15th to 21st event seems pretty sensible and we'd probably get
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.220]   all these new OSes at the same time, right?
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.220]   Where's it for WWDC?
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.260]   I don't know.
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.980]   I guess they do the, they do 10.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.980]   I don't understand.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:16.300]   See, it seems like if they're getting ready for WWDC, that'd be awfully forward.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.460]   That's June, right?
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   That's a long ways away.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.420]   I would say it's more to make sure that they can ship something with, I think it would
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:29.740]   kind of point to them having new iOS hardware that they're shipping in late March, let's
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.460]   say, or sorry, this month.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   It's this month.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.460]   I know.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.460]   Two weeks.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.460]   Three weeks.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.180]   I do hope they do it on the 21st because that ties in beautifully.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.900]   That's a Tuesday as opposed to the Wednesday that they were thinking of.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.820]   And they usually do it on a Tuesday.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.180]   Siri, one of the features of the next version of OS 10, which will be out, and that will
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:56.980]   be demonstrated in June at WWDC and probably shipped in the fall, would be Siri on the
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.260]   desktop.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.060]   That's funny because while Apple will, I'm sure, say we invented it, it's been around
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060]   for a while.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.940]   And I mean, both Windows does it.
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.940]   Windows does it.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.860]   Google does it with Chrome.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   I find it's not that useful.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.820]   Do you want to talk to your desktop?
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.460]   Only if the camera, only if the microphone were always on.
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.700]   I would love to have, no, I'm serious.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:25.020]   I would love to have the sort of functionality I have with Amazon Echo where I am true.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.180]   I'm somewhere else in the room.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:32.140]   I'm thinking I've got my iPad out and I'm reading or doing something else.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.820]   I just want to know what's the weather going to be later this afternoon and should I plan
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.220]   on leaving now as opposed to leaving two hours from now or just doing so, even when
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:46.660]   I'm actually in front of the keyboard and I'm reading something, then there's a unit
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:51.460]   of measurement in grams and I want to know how many ounces that is.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.140]   It's just these dead simple things.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.780]   It sounds silly until you have the ability to not have to hold down a key, not have to
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.260]   reach for a phone, not have to have a special thing.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.660]   There's just a waiting digital assistant that will respond to voice commands.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:10.500]   You find yourself using it all the time.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.700]   I think that the other thing that I still, the connection between Siri for me, the number
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.820]   one thing I use Siri for is Apple Music.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.180]   It was just being able to just call out that I want to hear a certain song is something
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.060]   that I probably use more often than all the other things.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.060]   Which is kind of magical to me.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.100]   I still think it's just, I know I've said it before, but it's just like the idea that
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.740]   I don't have to buy it, I don't have to do anything.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.540]   I just kind of, you know, just say I want to listen to, you know, whatever.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.460]   For me, Siri is just only two things.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.820]   I use Siri to make reminders as all the Apple Watch.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:48.620]   Siri reminded me to do such and such and I text my son to come down for dinner.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.140]   Hey Siri, text Justin.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.220]   Time for dinner works every way you can stop.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:56:00.500]   I admit I had, I used to use the ability to log into a remote computer and have it do
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:06.020]   some text to speech to scare my kids or tell them to come out of dinner.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   And that was fun.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   Wake up.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.020]   I do that all the time.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.660]   Henry, wake up.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.660]   It's time to go.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.120]   I'm a little, I'm a little sad that this generation is losing that fine must be 100 year
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.640]   old tradition of your parents is shrieking at you.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:28.900]   Well, I did, I also put sonos speakers in their bedroom and then remotely triggered
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.640]   loud music, but that was mean.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.280]   I stopped doing that.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.720]   Doesn't, none of it works either.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.800]   By the way, teenagers will sleep through anything.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.960]   Um, let's see.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.520]   I'm just looking for.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   I'm digging down.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   I'm looking.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.520]   Well, a, a, a modder who's created a 128 gig floppy disk.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.080]   I mean, I guess that's interesting.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.040]   That's a, that's a good bar bet.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.640]   Well, what he did is he put an SD card in, you know, floppy disk.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   All right.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   It's clever.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.320]   Wait, wait, where do you do for the drive?
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   You're going to have it.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   It's only fun.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.920]   Yeah, it's only fun when it's actually 128 gig zip drive.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   Now we're talking.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   Let's go for the full lap.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:21.520]   It's clear.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.720]   I'll just say there's so many of the working, working way to transmog, to make the storage
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.480]   of an SD card work inside a floppy.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.680]   There are so many computers that I've got in storage that I would just like to call out
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.880]   there or so many ways that I would like to use old floppies or try to.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:47.720]   And the problem is that now it's having a working piece of floppy disk media is like,
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:54.320]   I could use this for this fun little like MacMaim or server project, but if I, it will
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.320]   crumble into dust.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.240]   Do I want to waste it on this one thing or am I going to use it to, you know, translate
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.600]   the magical, for the magical phrase that will unlock the door to the golden portal to the
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.400]   alien wonder what realm that someone stored in 1983.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.880]   And they're just looking for somebody who has one working Fuji blank three and a half
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:13.880]   inch floppy.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.320]   And of course, I screwed it up because I was, I wanted to, I wanted to play, I wanted to
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.480]   play the games I was playing in college.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.120]   Don't don't worry, Andy.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.160]   I still have my floppy disk.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.880]   Ziggy and Stardust.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.680]   From 1986.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.040]   Can you play it though?
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.400]   I mean, can you can you use it?
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.240]   I've got something in the attic.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:40.400]   I still have the box of five and a quarter inch floppies that I used to get in the same
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   blue box.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.280]   These to carry through high school every single day.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.920]   And yes, part of part of me wants to put the boot them up and get them going again.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.680]   Part of me realizes that once again, do I want to risk them crumbling into dust and
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.360]   you know, preventing like a future technology.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.560]   We can, we can just take a 400 megapixel image of the disk with my phone and it will be able
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.200]   to read the read the variations of the magnetic field and actually get the data off them optically.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.680]   Somewhere I have a floppy disk that says source code that has all of my assembly language
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.520]   and Pascal source code from the early days of the Macintosh.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:21.640]   I don't, I don't be fun to get, but I don't, I can't, I can't throw away my copy of beneath
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   Apple DOS.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.760]   I cannot get my copy of assembly lines, the book, because they're just way too.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.480]   I have MPW on my bookshelf.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:35.280]   I have the Apple API document, the Mac API documentation.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.960]   You want to see my mouse pad?
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.200]   Ooh, developer university.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   Which is pretty nice.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.560]   My other one is, oh, the Mac Bible.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   Who worked on that?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   Was that you?
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   No.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.560]   Who did that?
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   Dan.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.320]   This was Arthur, Arthur, name and but it was a ton of people who submitted stuff to it.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.000]   But I, I don't know if I, I must add something in one of the later ones.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.320]   I have a bunch of them here, but that's the earliest one.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.560]   Mac Bible.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.520]   That is a classic.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.160]   Wow.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.520]   That was, that was the book that put, peach put on the map, I think.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520]   Ted Nase.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   He was the guy.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   I was, I was, that was a big book.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.760]   I mean, the other one, of course, is this one.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.360]   I mean, I need to want to talk about the.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.720]   I love this is a great shot, by the way, of Adam going to his bookshelf.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   A little Mac book, Robin Williams, not that Robin Williams.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:34.440]   She, that it was, that was the book I told everybody to get when they got their first
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   Mac.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.560]   You get the little Mac book, everything you need.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.680]   She wrote that on a Mac plus on her bed because she was living in this one bedroom apartment
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.120]   where I forget how many kids.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120]   In your bedroom?
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.120]   I remember that.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.120]   Nice.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120]   Nice.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   I understand that the Mac is a typewriter.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   Dan Frick.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.680]   Dan Frick is, that's who I was trying to remember.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   Dan Frick's, yeah.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   Dan Frick's did the Mac Bible.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   That's what I was trying to remember.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   He did some of them.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   Some of it.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680]   I mean, they were all different people.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   Sharon Acre did a bunch of them.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   Sharon Acre.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   Sharon Zardetto, sorry.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Sharon Zardetto Acre.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   And he's there.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   This is going to be the shortest show we've ever done.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.040]   It's my fault because we could have talked about the encryption thing for hours, but I
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.800]   just thought we've done that.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.200]   We've gone into bonus time for so many weeks.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.200]   I know.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200]   I know.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200]   It's like, we could--
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.680]   So here's something that I'll be curious if we get your opinion on.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:38.000]   With Antibets, we've been actually doing some deep looks into hidden features, not really
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.120]   hidden features, but things that people don't think about anymore, like quick look and service
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   are--
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.640]   I use quick look every single day.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.840]   It turns out these things are really deep.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.480]   I mean, you know, by writing an article and you just have to poke and poke.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.280]   Well, see, I use it shallowly.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   Quick look.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   I can do a quick look.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280]   Right.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.960]   Is there more than I should do?
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.640]   You can get a-- you can do-- if you quick look a couple of files, a couple of images,
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.920]   you can then do a full screen and turn it into a slide show.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   Right.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.440]   You can get all these quick generators that will let you look at different stuff, like
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.800]   CSV files or in design files.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.240]   Do you have to download those?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.080]   Go find the Tibbetsite search and quick look.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.280]   And as this article, I could not believe the amount of stuff discovered while we were
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   just--
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.640]   Whatever happened, like Automator and AppleScript, that's still deep in there.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   Still there.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   Still there.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   But nobody ever talks.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.480]   Poor Sal, nobody ever talks about it anymore.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.040]   It's still-- you know, it's funny.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.200]   It's still-- it's part of, you know, those-- the Automator tools and the AppleScript tools
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.280]   are just so fundamentally part of some businesses that--
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   Right.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280]   They can't take it out.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.280]   You couldn't take it out.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.400]   And it's really useful when you get your head around it.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.640]   It is something that-- I have lots of little tools to convert images and do things that I
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.680]   just-- it's just easier to do it, you know, to build a service for that.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:57.600]   And then the idea that you can just throw it out there, that it's an incredibly powerful
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.520]   architecture that unfortunately a lot of people don't know enough about.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.120]   I have Automator Actions.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   These Automator workflows which are extremely complicated.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.400]   You know, they're nested.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.680]   They do different things.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.360]   But it actually-- I can control click on a PDF or an ePUB or a Moby and select something
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.240]   from a services menu.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.320]   And it will copy the file and rename it to different places on my server.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.800]   It will upload it to one or two different remote servers.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.920]   This is all the distribution I do for take control.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:34.840]   And it's this very complicated Automator stuff, but it saves me half an hour every time I
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   invoke those.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   Yes.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.160]   It's primarily publishers, isn't it?
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.640]   The sound was always talking about how publishers use it.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   Publishers really rely on it.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.320]   But I guess, I mean, sort of the bigger picture, I guess, what I'm getting at.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.000]   And the same thing we're looking at preview right now is just that there's all this great
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.280]   stuff that's actually deep inside OS 10 or deep inside these bundled apps that people
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.360]   just have forgotten about if they ever knew.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.360]   And it's been interesting publishing these articles and getting people saying, "Oh, wow,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360]   I never knew it.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360]   Do that.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   That's so great."
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.480]   And you feel like actually in a difference in their lives.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   I agree.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.840]   You know, it's an operating system around for a long time and Apple hasn't taken a lot
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   out.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   So there's still stuff.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.000]   But there's also stuff that's kind of you wonder, you know, has it become vestigial,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.160]   like the services menu?
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.400]   Ah, there's some interesting stuff you can do with services.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.040]   Again, people don't really think about it.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:32.680]   And but, you know, there's, you want to talk about stuff not getting any love.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.880]   There's been no changes to it in ages and ages, but there are still some really interesting
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:44.280]   services out there you can get to manipulate text, open stuff in different apps.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   You know, just work around the one way that you're normally allowed something.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   Right.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.640]   And so, yeah, so both of these kind of series as we've started have been really interesting.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.920]   I mean, preview again.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.440]   I didn't even know until I started writing this article that preview can scan.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.240]   Preview can take screenshots.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.720]   Preview can download photos from your iPhone.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.080]   You know, who knew the preview could do all that stuff?
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.560]   And it's sort of like building in image capture and grab and the scanner utility, but it's
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   still it's all right there in preview when you need it.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.040]   I think that there's there should be I think that I would love to read an article that's
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.400]   sort of like the built in system decathlon.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.080]   The 10 crucial apps that's that are so useful and solve so many problems.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.680]   Image capture solved a problem for me yesterday because I was at a neighbor's house trying
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.720]   to find out why she couldn't get data.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.840]   She couldn't sink something to to an older iPod touch.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.020]   And knowing that it was probably iTunes doing something very iTunes-y I launched image capture
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.400]   to see if does it appear to does it appear on the bus to image capture?
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.120]   Okay, image capture can see this.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.040]   That means that I can definitely rule out it's a problem with this device.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.440]   And there's just such a long list of stuff like that just classic tools.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.000]   I use preview all the time I use that I use text edit all the time.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.360]   A lot of people don't you show them the console app and it's like you pull down like a candle
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.480]   on a wall sconce and a whole wall flipped around on their back.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.760]   Oh my God, I where were these error messages coming from like there there like roaches they've
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.640]   been inside your house all the time.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.760]   You just only get to see two or three of them struggling around into the light.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.520]   Can I ask a question does anybody use the tagging system you know the color tagging system
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   and finder.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   I don't.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.960]   I use it.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   So what a lot of times what I do is when I'm using the the colored system is especially
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.400]   from copying like a lot of times we're doing archives of you know on site and you're trying
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.640]   to move things around and you want to make sure you remember what was what and who goes
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.200]   where and and things that have already been transferred get this color and things that
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.480]   have it or things that have to go into you know so it's much easier because then you can
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.920]   also select by those.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.760]   And so anyway I definitely.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.640]   I feel like it's one of those things that Apple wishes they could take out but they
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:14.800]   know that there's one in five that use it would scream holy murder one of the problems
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.520]   I when I started looking at it I actually had to give up on using it in part because
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.240]   tags transfer via Dropbox.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.960]   So you've got everyone else's damn tags.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.960]   I know that.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   Yes.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   It's part of the metadata.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.400]   Easy so yeah so it was one of those things where you know you could have this nice set
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.000]   of your own tags and they're all this.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.280]   Oh I didn't there.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.760]   So yeah I gave up on that.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.640]   I feel like I'm not a good Mac user because I don't use them like that's I should use
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   that.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   Why don't I.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   I'm just one of the new features.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.600]   You know the real the real Mac users don't we don't need those thinking tags.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   I sold it.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.600]   I sold it.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.400]   I know how I feel about color icons frankly.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.840]   But that's that's the difficulty.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.160]   We once you this we are all expert users but we have the same problem that newbies have
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.400]   which is once we find something that works great we're not really very inclined to explore
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.960]   and try to find a different process and that's that's universal I mean even that that's
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   just the human experience.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:22.320]   I was so determined to find a one to one replacement for my Osprey bag that I love love love love
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.680]   love that they stopped making like two or three years ago I was about to like spend
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.920]   more money on eBay buying secondhand ones or new old stock that it sort of blinded me
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.520]   to the idea of Andy.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.720]   Yes it you know that the old one works very well for you but perhaps in the next in the
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.520]   last five or six years someone has invented a new bag that's even better for you now that
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.960]   you're using an iPad Pro and this stuff and that kind of forced me to look for new bags
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.400]   and I'm really really happy with it.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.000]   Then you really have to remind yourself that if there's a process that's working great
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.120]   for you there can still be a process that works even better for you.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.200]   Sometimes that involves buying a lot of software that is not going to work for you immediately
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.440]   and sometimes it involves holding down the option the shift key when you click everything
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.840]   just to see what things can do.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.280]   I think it's a segment that your favorite hidden Mac feature.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:17.360]   It was going to say for Andy for color icons if you select any app any file document app
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.440]   whatever and hit command C to copy it and switch to preview and then choose new for
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.880]   clipboard you'll get all the icons from that file.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.480]   And then what do you do?
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   Well you've got.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.200]   That you try to make your terminal t-shirt.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.440]   That's like from ResEdit days.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.840]   That's like it is.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.320]   I still miss ResEdit.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.880]   I built a surfer version of Photoshop at one point so all the messages were like you
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.440]   know when I was out of memory it was like dude I just can't do that.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.520]   And everyone would think that you're this amazing master hacker because you have a copy
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.880]   of Mac right that says edit man.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.800]   Yeah yeah.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:07.720]   I would actually I'm in for twenty dollars or so I want to commission a really good 256
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.360]   pixel logo a version of the resident icon.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.600]   I know I can't use it on anything but I just want to.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.720]   But it was a little classic Mac with like a squiggle in it.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   What did it.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.200]   It was it was like it was like a pop goes the weasel like a pop up.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   That's right.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.200]   Oh that's right.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   A little Jack in the box coming out of it.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   I'm out of the top of it.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.200]   I'm sure if I Google ResEdit icon there's probably somebody out there who is.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.360]   Only a hundred eighty eight by hundred eighty eight.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.360]   Andy is right.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   We need bigger ones.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]   There it is.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   There it is.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   Jack in the box.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.840]   If you're ever doing a one of the great uses for that by the way is if you ever are built
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.800]   doing a presentation and you have to be talking about apps getting a hold of their the really
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.160]   high res icons they come you know they're pings with alpha channels.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.440]   So you just literally grab that ping and throw it into your keynote and boom it's you know
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.720]   so you're I think what you do is just have it in your dock.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:04.080]   Like and see if anybody notices that you have resident in your dock.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.120]   Only for some reason now when I feel like a night high resolution.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.240]   Oh he has the new resident.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.640]   Where can I get that.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.080]   And I pad with the swift logo on it.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.840]   Oh man.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.680]   That'll lead to some excited excited Q&A silly keynote tricks.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.360]   We're going to come back and talk more actually your picks coming up in just a second but
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:36.160]   first a word for all of our our friends who are suffering with bad web hosting and I
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.720]   know that's a lot of you with ugly websites that aren't mobile responsive.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.960]   Kind of glom e-commerce onto the side of a site.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.480]   You don't need to do that.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.880]   Stop the suffering.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.040]   Get square space.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.140]   You really should.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.900]   Squarespace is it does it all beautiful sites.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:03.040]   The templates are done by not only the best designers out there but also the best engineers.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.960]   So your site looks great and by the way completely customizable.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.560]   No no square space site looks like any others not cookie cutter.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.320]   In fact pick a template and then below it will show you all the some of the sites some of
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.080]   the that are using it and you can see how they all look different.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.240]   They all have a different feel because it's so easy to customize your site.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.880]   Whether you're a designer or a filmmaker a photographer a musician a blogger you want
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.040]   your site to be aesthetic to reflect your personality your style.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.360]   Particularly if you're a visual artist.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.520]   Squarespace is great for artists of all stripes.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.400]   But also if you're a restaurant right or you know you want to match your decor and you
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.920]   don't want your commerce if you're selling something on your site to look like a separate
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.960]   thing that you're going out to every squares every squarespace template has commerce built
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.640]   in every single plan has commerce in it.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:59.160]   You could choose from you know the basic commerce or the professional.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.000]   You can add all of your social feeds.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.440]   And by the way when you sign up for you even get a free domain name.

[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.520]   in and I've got a calendar there in a portfolio.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.840]   I have to put some of these new pictures I've been taken with the galaxy S7 up there.

[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   You should.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.480]   All right time for a fix.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.640]   I'm going to start I never start usually because I don't have anything interesting but
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.480]   this time I kind of do.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.360]   It's this little doohickey.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.960]   By the way when are we getting a new Mac book on March 21st.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.160]   Unlikely me I don't know.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.160]   I think there's anything wrong with the old man I love the Mac book by the way I have
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.200]   the custom one with the black apple.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.480]   Good luck getting that.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   You're special.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.640]   I'm thinking may but I don't know.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:40.000]   I'd love to see a new one but I'm still this is my go to laptop at home all the time.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.400]   But of course you know the one thing that's wrong with it it only has one connector a
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   type C connector.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.720]   So there've been lots of solutions I own every type C cable connector but and everything.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.880]   This is the one I just got that I love $50 from Hyperdrive.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.040]   It's a five in one hub that matches the finish.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.920]   It fits in flush.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.040]   It does what you need a connector to do.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.160]   You can power your Mac through the type C on here.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.360]   It's actually two way so you could actually charge your phone with it as well.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.920]   It has an SD card and a micro SD card reader and two USB three ports.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920]   This is nice.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   It's elegant.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920]   It's simple.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   It's beautiful.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   You can get it to match.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.560]   Silver gold or space gray.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.040]   The finish of your Mac although why anyone would have anything but a gold Mac book I don't
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   know.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:34.440]   I bought one just to see if I'd like it and I do so I got one another one for Lisa because
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.720]   she has a Mac book too.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.360]   Very nice.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.760]   Now I can just travel with this and I have everything I need.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.320]   I can put the USB card.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.800]   The thumb drives in there.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.800]   The memory cards in there.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.560]   Everything I need.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.920]   No ethernet port.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.800]   Okay sorry.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.200]   But it's common.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.200]   I know.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.920]   You're the only one who wants one actually Alex.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.320]   No you could just use the USB ethernet.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.320]   Plenty of it.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   Okay.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   All right.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.800]   Mr. Alex Lindsey your pick of the week.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.440]   So I have a silly pick and then I have a more serious pick.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.480]   So the silly pick is we've been talking about this for a while at the office.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480]   So one of the guys brought this in.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:18.760]   Marty brought this in and so this is just a little killer flashlight.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.200]   Is it a tactical flashlight?
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   No it's not.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   It's not even that bright.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.840]   It's bright enough but not too bright.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.680]   But this is the part that makes it kind of cool is you can pull it out and of course
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   you can you know like turn the little.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   Oh it's got a goose neck.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.600]   Oh but it gets better.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600]   But there's more.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   There's more.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.080]   You can pull it out like that.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   It's the extensible.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   Look at that.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.160]   You can use it as a pointer or a cat toy or a whipper or something.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.480]   Okay.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.200]   And then it's got a magnet.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.400]   It's got a magnet at the bottom so you can like stick it to anything that's metal.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   So we have I have found this to be remarkably useful when we're in production because you
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.000]   can find you'll find something just stick it to it and with a little light on.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   Oh that's great.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   You can you can find it.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   It's like nine dollars.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   So it's on Amazon.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   I can't remember the name.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.280]   There's a whole bunch of them that look like this if you do like goose neck flashlight
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.400]   or whatever and get the cheapest one because they're all the same.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.840]   It's all from the same Chinese company.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.040]   It's the same Chinese company that makes them and in summer nineteen dollar I bought
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.400]   like four of them just just just for our listeners.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.440]   I bought a group of them to figure out exactly which one was the best thinking that the more
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.840]   expensive one might be the best and it turns out it was identical.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.840]   They range from seven to eighty dollars.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.720]   Yeah and it's $80.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.240]   I did not spend I did not buy an eighty dollar one.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.240]   I did buy this.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.520]   Some of them might be different but everything up to about twenty dollars seems to be the
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.520]   same.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.320]   Anyway, it's it's like it runs off of the whole in you know, it's just running off of
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.960]   like a little watch battery or something like a flat battery.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.720]   So it it's pretty compact anyway.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.120]   So that's the silly one.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:54.760]   The one that's really useful is is one of the kind of the the you know, the white whale
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.400]   that I've been I've been going after for a long time is finding a way to get professional
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.160]   cameras to get into Skype without using Skype TX.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:07.280]   So I have Skype TX but I need more connections than one and I don't want to spend $4,000
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   a pop.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.760]   I do like it and it's useful to have one of them.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.720]   I don't want four of them necessarily.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:18.240]   So what I what I found here is this and it's actually hard to show you because it's being
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.240]   used at the moment.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.040]   You're using it right now.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:31.320]   Yeah, this is the Ino Genie SDI to USB three and and they have HDMI DVI to USB three.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.000]   The the HDMI one is 4K.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.160]   I think that's the one I that's the link that I sent.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:42.440]   So it's 4K and all of them when you connect it to your Mac will show up in Skype as a web
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.440]   camera.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.040]   So this has been a big issue because a lot of a lot of the tools that we've had up until
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.640]   now they won't show up as they won't show up on in Skype.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.600]   And so you you end up not being able to put a real camera or a camera system or anything
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.440]   else into into into Skype directly.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.960]   You need something you needed for a while the Skype TX box TX box to do that.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:10.520]   And so anyway, so that's been sorted and it's a it's a pretty nifty there's a lot of reasons
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.880]   to have a Skype TX box for broadcasters and so on so forth.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.760]   But if you're looking for something a little less expensive, I think this is $395 and a
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.320]   little bit more expensive than some of the other ways to integrate to get cameras in.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:30.560]   But this is the only one that I've I've tested that works in blue gene hangouts Skype.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.640]   So it seems to work across the board and it's been it's been very useful.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   So anyway, that's my that's my pick.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.360]   Very nice.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.520]   Very nice.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.440]   If you need it, you know, you need it.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.840]   Yeah, yeah, you don't know.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   You don't like.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   Oh my God.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   That is amazing.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840]   Everyone else is like, huh?
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.240]   What you ever spent $395 on that?
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.160]   What the heck is that do?
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.920]   Mr. Adam angst.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.720]   You have something you like you're excited about?
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720]   You want to pick?
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.080]   I do and I have to say this falls into the very silly category.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:06.240]   But you know, as you guys know, I'm a country boy and and sometimes I just want a little
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:11.040]   background ambiance without having to play Spotify.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.440]   Don't don't do Apple music.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.760]   Keep up music away from my devices.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.480]   But and so I don't want to do don't want to do music.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:25.040]   And so I ran across this thing called noisio and it is a free little app that gives you
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.480]   sound.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.280]   But what's cool about it is is that it has all these different sound looping sounds it
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.000]   can make and you can mix them.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.480]   So I have this this for me perfect sound that includes, you know, sort of birds and farm
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:49.080]   noises and, you know, just a little bit of a stream in the background and, you know,
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.080]   it's one of those things.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.280]   I turn it on and it's just, I don't know, just relaxing and, you know, it's and my son
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.600]   came to it like those digital birds.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.400]   You know, I don't I don't see any birds here.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   What are these birds?
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   I'm hearing.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.280]   And it just it sounds great.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.800]   And I really like being able to to configure it to just the exact level of, you know, each
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   type of sound.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.960]   You can have you could be in a Paris cafe with a thunderstorm going on and for a place.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:20.200]   And that's and that's and there's some that really don't quite make sense, you know, like
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:25.080]   the farm and the sailing schooner, for instance, you know, you're like, okay, we've got Bessie
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.080]   on the ship.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.440]   But I have to say, you know, I said having you having grown up on a farm, the sounds
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   are right.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.840]   It's exactly what it sounds like.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.200]   And, and, you know,
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:43.080]   Oh, Uncle Aaron, God, his back with the shot.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080]   Good.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.240]   How many times have I heard that?
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:54.120]   No, I Z O is no I Z dot I O and it's Mac or iOS.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.040]   Yeah, I haven't tried an iPhone just because I don't know.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.280]   I don't listen to, I don't need I don't need my phone making noises at me.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.280]   I'm just walking around with my pocket.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:08.000]   I don't think that I I remember the first time that I was able to move into a big enough
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.360]   apartment that I didn't have to like sleep in the same room that all my other stuff was.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.040]   I found it so hard to get to sleep because I was used to the white noise of like my tower
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.880]   Mac just there was always this.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:28.280]   That was a so pleasant, but also reminded me that if whenever the room was completely
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:32.720]   silent, it meant that something was wrong because that that fan should always be spinning.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.160]   And it really took me a couple of weeks.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.000]   It was like having a new dog where I'm just going to sleep in the office a couple of
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.680]   nights a week until I get used to the idea of not having fans that's those fans in my
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.360]   bedroom.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.320]   You can actually I think Spotify and other systems have kind of ambient sounds that you
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320]   can even Pandora.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.360]   I think it's probably this is nice because you can you can create your own make your ability
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.280]   part that I that I like, you know, because a lot of the times when I just feel like,
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.680]   oh, there's one thing it's just sort of the same all the time.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.840]   And it's nice to be able to you can make your own collections and so you can switch
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.200]   from, you know, the thunderstorm on the sailing ship to the, you know, the coffee shop to
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.880]   the to the sunny day in the woods kind of thing.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.680]   This is nice because I have a tonight as you know, ringing in the years and it turns out
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:24.520]   that kind of rain sounds kind of moderate moderate modify actually improve it.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   Now how come I'm looking at it.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:32.040]   I have October rain coffee house and thunderstorm, but how come these are great out campfire
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.560]   and oh, I just have to.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560]   Yes, yes.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   Oh, I can turn them all on.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.560]   Oh, my God.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:44.560]   We are we are inside a train on the farm.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.360]   It's it's it's insane.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360]   And the blue whales, they're coming.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   Okay, that probably wouldn't be.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.160]   You know, the Kelvin and Hobbs has the airplane and the train rack and it's like it's all
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   happening at once.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   That's that's what I want.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.200]   What I like is this is actually will be in your menu and you can have it started login.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.000]   You can even have it play after launch so you can just have it.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.240]   You know, whenever you're at your mat.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.920]   I love this and it's free.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.160]   I was like, what's not to like?
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.960]   God, Lee.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.360]   I'm feeling more calm already.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:26.880]   I just I love the idea that someone didn't do this and I have half arsed way.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.280]   It was I'm going to do this.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.680]   Let's make the best version of this.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.280]   I can possibly do this.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.200]   This is what this is what I can contribute to the entire world.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.120]   Just the best the only version of this that ever needs to exist.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.440]   I'm going to turn off deep space sailing yet.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:45.240]   Maybe I'll have the train every once in a while.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   No more farm.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.240]   This is nice.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.240]   It's fun.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.240]   It's a tired taste.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.160]   I mean, I like the rooster, but I could see someone.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.160]   If you grew up with a farm, you probably have a mixed mix.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   The thing, you know, a little bit and I like be just a little bit of wind chimes, you
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   know, not so.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.760]   Everyone's wild blue whale.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   I'm going to turn off the train.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.200]   I don't need to be inside the train.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.720]   Do you have the wheels?
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.120]   No, I see you.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.760]   It's in the app store on both Mac and Tasha and iOS.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.520]   And that's how it's going to sound on our podcast from now on.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.600]   Andy and I go you pick of the week.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.840]   Really excited about this just yesterday, the Raspberry Raspberry Pi organization released
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.040]   the Raspberry Pi 3 computer.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.960]   We've been talking about this for a while.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.840]   This is not the Raspberry Pi 3.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:43.120]   This is the Raspberry Pi 2 because they sent me one a couple of weeks ago to play with.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   And so it's as Raspberry Pies are there.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.400]   It's hooked up to all kinds of cool stuff that I'm building and experimenting with and
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.960]   I couldn't like disentangle it to put it on camera.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.400]   You probably if you haven't heard of the Raspberry Pi, this is a $35 computer based
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:06.600]   on a system on a chip that can do pretty much whatever you ever want a computer to do.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.760]   It'll be whatever you want it to be.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:13.440]   So if you want it to be a media server, you can install Linux on it and use it as a media
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.440]   server.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.640]   Use it as a weak powered desktop computer.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   You can use it as a game emulator.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.520]   You can use it as pretty much wherever you want.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:32.040]   It has built in HDMI, has built in four USB ports, has an ethernet port and also has this
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.440]   hardware header.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.160]   So you can basically add on and build whatever component that whatever you want to build
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   this with.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:48.680]   So if you want to add, if you have let's say your wall e-toy, this is not, I built this
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.720]   with a previous project.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.000]   So if you have your wall e-toy and you notice that has a demonstrator switch on it and you
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.480]   want it to, and you want it so that you can activate it over the internet or use it so
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.000]   that every time something happens on Twitter, Eve wakes up and does something to let you
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.560]   know that that's happened.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.360]   I don't have this sort of electronic engineering mojo to do that myself.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.800]   However, I can just simply easily build an interface for that on this by hooking this
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:23.280]   up to like two pins and maybe a resistor and then write some Python code that runs on this
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.920]   that looks at web pages or looks at Twitter has a Twitter command line sort of stuff and
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.240]   makes things work that way.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:37.840]   Again, it's, I love it because the Apple II was the last computer that I ever use that
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.000]   I felt like I know everything going on inside and outside this machine.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.280]   There's nothing I cannot do with this because I know every scrap of code on this and I
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.120]   know how to build hardware for it.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   This is, takes you back to that sort of thing and it costs 35 stinking bucks.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.320]   And so, and once again, if you just want to use it as a, you have a kid that wants to,
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:03.160]   and you want to have them have a desktop computer in their, in their own room, you can run,
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.280]   you can install Chromium on this and essentially turn it into a Chromebook.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.000]   And once again, just plug it into any USB mouse and a USB keyboard and any HDMI screen
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.920]   and you have a desktop machine.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.160]   I've set one up to just be a media player.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.560]   It hasn't, of course, doesn't have a rotating hard drive, but it does have a micro SD slot
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.520]   so I can put 128 gigs or 200 gigs of storage on this onboard.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.840]   Or if I want to actually plug in a spinning hard drive, it will interact with a spinning
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840]   hard drive.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.560]   That's, that's how flexible it is.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:40.920]   Now, the Raspberry Pi three, put down Eve, is a huge, huge step up because now for the
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.440]   first time it actually has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi actually on the board.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.960]   This used to be something where you'd buy like a little tiny micro dongle and put them
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.520]   into two of these ports.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.880]   That's one of the reasons why when they updated a couple years ago, they added four ports
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.040]   because everybody would put Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on it.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:02.320]   Now it's onboard and it's as small as this is, it's in my testing, it's about as powerful
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.880]   as the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth you'd find on your phone.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.280]   So it's not as we have to plug in an external antenna.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   So as a result, you can just basically install this anywhere and you have a networked completely
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.600]   internet-aware machine that will do damn near anything you want to do.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.440]   And if you're saying, but I don't know anything about programming in Python, I don't know anything
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.720]   about electronic engineering, I don't know how to get cool sensors and components.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.560]   That's where you go to Adafruit because there is, it was, this device was originally designed
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.640]   as an educational computer to make sure that every kid in every school could have a computer
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.600]   they could work on and learn about computers with.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:46.360]   And as a result, it is born from this culture of if you've done something cool or interesting
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.880]   with it, you're not going to try to sell a piece of software or sell a hardware add-on,
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.200]   you're going to publish how you did that.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:58.000]   So it is actually quite simple to attach like an LCD touchscreen to it.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.240]   It's very, very simple to add sensors and buttons.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:06.160]   If your Cub Scout group wants to do like a version of Jeopardy and you need like those
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:11.600]   three like buzzer buzz in controllers, you'll be able to find those projects right there.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.240]   And it just gives you the more you look at sites like Adafruit.com where they show you
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.680]   they'll not only sell you the components, but they'll also show you how to interface
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.680]   them.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.760]   The more interesting ideas you come up with my next project because I keep, I keep buying
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.680]   Raspberry Pi's as they come out.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.680]   So as a result, the, my old main Raspberry Pi is now available.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:36.320]   Now I've got this idea where I've got like my, this is the modem that was part, it was
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.800]   pretty much my life in high school.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.160]   And just looking at these dancing lights, LEDs in the front.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.760]   And so now my idea was this is the actual modem.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   So I don't want it.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.840]   It's too precious to be.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.360]   But I bought an identical one off of eBay.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.160]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take out all the guts, replace it with a Raspberry
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.680]   Pi three.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.960]   So it's always going to be on.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.160]   It's always going to be a media server and a sensor server.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.840]   But I've also bought from Aida fruit, a bank of Neopixels that will replace the existing
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:12.160]   LEDs in here so that I will be able to once again look up from the sofa at this box and
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:15.960]   see a familiar sequence of twinkling lights that I know that this means that things are
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   normal.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.400]   But if something is going on, let's say there's movement in the backyard or a file server
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.360]   or a print server on the network has failed, there's going to be another pattern of lights
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:30.320]   that will tell me without having to actually look at ASCII readouts that will just show
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.800]   me what's going on.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.920]   I hope you take from this my enthusiasm for this stupid cockamamie project that I'm going
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.160]   to have a lot of fun doing.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.560]   That's not going to be terribly, terribly, terribly useful, but is eminently doable because
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:50.640]   I have this $35 thing that is eminently documented and eminently supported by a big community.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.280]   It doesn't put any limitations on what you can do.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:59.600]   I can think of no better gift for a kid, let's say eight years old or up that shows an aptitude
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.800]   and a desire to build stuff than a Raspberry Pi.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.480]   Again, this is real power.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.160]   Those are all model twos, Jason.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.000]   If you show my screen, I have the model three.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.160]   It's still back ordered.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.440]   It was just announced like yesterday.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.440]   Father Robert has one.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.200]   We're going to play with it on Saturday on the new screensavers.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.360]   I know you've been in touch with him.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.440]   It's so awesome.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.920]   I can't tell you how enthusiastic it is.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:32.040]   I think that the Raspberry Pi is easily as impressive a computer as even the iPad Pro
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:38.840]   as anything that Apple has made because this is again a $35 computer that a kid can own
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:44.480]   and not just because they have $35 meaning that there is nothing they are not allowed
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.440]   to do with this.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.000]   There's nothing that is not documented.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.520]   Any idea they have, they can figure out how to do it.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   They want to build a robot.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.640]   They can do anything with it.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   If they do blow it up, 35 stinkin' bucks, you can buy another one.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.960]   It's easy as Pi.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.960]   It's great.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   Thanks to Microsoft.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.520]   You can get Windows 10 on it, but you can also get Minecraft on it.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.080]   It's a special edition of Minecraft that has an API for Python.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.240]   It comes with Python and idle.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:12.360]   It's a great computer for learning how to program.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.680]   Really great for learning how to program.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:20.320]   It's nice when you do a Hello World program on whatever computer you're using, but it's
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.360]   quite another thing when you write a piece to build a pyramid in Minecraft.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   Oh yeah, no.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.240]   I'm thinking just as simple as I've hooked up an LED and I can make that light go on
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   and on.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:35.200]   I can basically, and I can hook up a push button to it that it will, the LED will only
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.320]   come on if I tap the button three times, not two and not four.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:44.400]   That is amazing because you're building something real that this is not just lights on a screen.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.960]   This is a physical object that you can make.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.240]   Once you teach them how to hook it up with the stepper motors and stuff like that and
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.280]   servos, oh my frickin' God.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.280]   It's just quite amazing.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.360]   The key thing, and I didn't really realize it until I got the last Raspberry Pi, which
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.880]   of course I just bought, which is why they came out with a new one, is that it really
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.800]   is a computer.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.760]   It's just a computer.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.720]   It's a $35 computer.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.880]   It's not a hobbyist breakout box or something.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.240]   This is a full computer.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.840]   It doesn't stick together with Legos.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.400]   The new one is a big step up, not only because it now has that on board wireless features,
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.520]   but also the CPU is about a third more powerful.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:28.320]   The upper limits of what you could really do with the previous Pi were evident once you
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:36.680]   load up a web browser on it and try to launch the Verge or some other really script heavy
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680]   site.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.880]   Now if you put Chromium on it, it can keep up with it just fine.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:46.560]   If you want to use it for Google Apps, it will really just keep up with all this stuff
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.560]   just fine.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:53.840]   It's just powerful enough now that it will be a very credible machine for pretty much
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.600]   any basic task you want to throw at it.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.600]   How does it combine with Arduino Andy?
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.760]   An Arduino is electrically, electronically it's a lot simpler because it's not booting
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.960]   up into a command prompt.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.280]   And Arduino is more of a microcontroller, more of a programmable controller than a real computer.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.720]   You can, for instance, Adafruit will teach you how to hook up a display to it and get
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.360]   input and output from it.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.520]   But that's the best way to illustrate it.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.040]   If you hook up a display to Raspberry Pi, you will get a login screen and a command prompt
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.680]   and a GUI that responds to a mouse.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.800]   So if you want to make it work like a standard computer as opposed to something you programmed
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.160]   to do cool stuff, then that's what the live will do for you.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.560]   There's a couple of things that I use Arduino that I'm working playing around with in Arduino
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.360]   for that is very low.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.240]   You actually don't want it to be thinking.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.200]   You want to do exactly what you tell us to do very quickly and very low latency.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.520]   But there's a lot of limitations to that.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   But it does, you know, we--
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.560]   Yeah, I think this is a Linux computer.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.560]   I mean, it really--
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.800]   It's just a full computer.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.720]   It runs a version of Debian.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:04.720]   And so--
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.040]   But I'm just about to start playing with the Raspberry Pi.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.480]   And specifically, I want to get my son into it.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   He's eight.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.480]   And--
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   Perfect for that.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   It was funny.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.560]   I really was kind of looking sideways at Minecraft until I realized--
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.560]   Oh, no.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   --until we were talking about it.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.560]   Perfect for that.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.560]   With Python, I was like, oh.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.920]   Because I told him, you know, you can program to build stuff.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.240]   And he just-- his eyes got really big.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.480]   And I was like, oh, he's going to be like a little happy about it.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.480]   He writes five lines of code that builds a little house.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.680]   And you just do it.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.680]   And the house is there.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.920]   He'll be off to the races.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.960]   Even just as a utility sort of thing, there was a couple of years ago, there was a situation
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.440]   where I just needed to know how many times was a certain door being opened in clothes
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.000]   in my house.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.160]   And maybe there were easier ways to do it.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.640]   Maybe it wasn't a terribly complex problem.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.880]   But it just occurred to me that, oh, I could easily do that.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.600]   I can write the code for-- I can hook up a magnetic switch to the door, plugged into
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.600]   the Raspberry Pi.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:03.640]   And I just off of-- it'll run off of a standard like micro USB charger or battery pack.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.080]   And so I just simply-- and I installed an Apache web server on it.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:12.120]   And it took me all of like 45 minutes to write code that would simply create a static web
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.680]   page with a number on it of how many times since power up has this door been opened in
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.680]   clothes.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.360]   And so from anywhere in the house or theoretically anywhere in the world, I could then simply
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:27.000]   open up that web page that's simply a file on this little Raspberry Pi and find it, OK,
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.160]   I've opened this door 35 times so far this month.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:36.480]   Or the person who is allowed entry to that shed has-- OK, I guess they were in and out
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.960]   of that shed a couple of times.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.960]   Nothing nefarious.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   I was just trying to figure out-- it was about time for me to start putting locks on
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   it.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.840]   I was trying to figure out how much would it inconvenience this other person that's storing
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:51.080]   tools in my shed if I were to put a lock on it and give them a copy of the key.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.460]   And I was like, OK, so he only tends to use it a couple times a month so it wouldn't
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:55.960]   even give me all that much.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.200]   And like I said, if it were a real electronic engineering project, it would be way, way
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:04.200]   too much for me to say, I want to create a web server based machine so I could access
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200]   from anywhere.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.960]   But because I have now three or four of these, I was like, OK.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.320]   And I had it actually just like in a Ziploc baggy outside because if someone was walking
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.800]   to the backyard and stole it, OK, I'd be sad about it.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.160]   But OK, 35 bucks, who cares?
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.800]   Andy Enoco, aid of good place to get Raspberry Pi.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.440]   It's back ordered now, of course, because it hasn't come into stock.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.840]   But ADAFRUIT.com, we love Lady Ada.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.840]   I don't want to support her.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.680]   But there are lots of other places that sell the Raspberry Pi 3 or will when it gets in
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:34.680]   stock.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.640]   One last story that just came in, and it's very timely.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.880]   The gentleman who invented public key cryptography, which feel Diffie and Martin Hellman just
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.360]   won the Turing Prize, a $1 million prize, considered the Nobel Prize of Computing from
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.920]   the Association of Computing Machinery.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:39:00.080]   So congratulations to Whit Diffie and his partner, Martin Hellman, who invented probably
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.920]   the most important technology for communication of the 21st century public key crypto.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:07.920]   Well done.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.920]   Well done.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.920]   With a backdoor, of course.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   No back doors in theirs.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.840]   We were able to reach them in the basement room where they're now being held.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.840]   There's a picture of them in 1977 when they were working on it.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.840]   Pippies.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.840]   Of course they were.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.840]   Of course they were.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.720]   Hey, I want to thank everybody for joining us for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.120]   Thanks, especially to Adam Anxt.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.440]   Love having you on Come Back Soon.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.640]   tidbits.com.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:42.320]   The oldest Mac journal in existence and one you must read weekly because it's wonderful.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.640]   Subscribe to the mailing list.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.600]   He also has the Great Take Control series of books that really do help you take control
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.600]   of your Mac.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.600]   I can't wait to read the one of the hidden Mac stuff.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600]   That sounds great.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.600]   I was going to say we're working that.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.000]   It's going to come and we're going to do the articles and then we're going to put them
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   all together.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   Good.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   Now we've got plans now.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.240]   You've got a sale right here.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.640]   I'll tell you, I can't wait.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   Always a pleasure.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]   Thank you for joining us Adam.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   I appreciate it.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.120]   Alex Lindsey joining us from We Don't Know Where, but it doesn't matter because we can put
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.400]   him anywhere in the world.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.400]   Of course you'll find him.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.960]   This background is working so well.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960]   It's so realistic.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.600]   He's also on the Twitter @AlexLindsay, S-A-Y.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:22.200]   And of course Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.200]   Thank you for being here.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.000]   @Enoco on the Twitter, I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.680]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.560]   I'm sure we'll talk in about half an hour on security now with Steve Gibson about Whit
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.000]   Diffie and public key crypto and all that the RSA conference is going on right now.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.320]   I'm sure there'll be some news from RSA as well.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.160]   But if you want to watch Mac Break Weekly each and every week, I highly encourage you
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:50.520]   to tune in live 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time 1900 UTC on Twitter TV.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.800]   And if you can't watch live on demand audio and video on our website, Twitter.tv/mbw on
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.880]   the many apps like Stitcher, the Twitter apps themselves and of course whatever you use
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   to listen to podcasts.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.160]   Or you can just, if you have an Amazon Echo, you can just say, "Echo, listen to Twitter
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.640]   live on TuneIn," and you'll hear it.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:16.920]   It's, incidentally, if you are watching live, Apple's team, legal team is now being sworn
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.920]   in.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.920]   We're going to switch to that as soon as I am done.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.760]   I don't have to switch to C-Span, just stay tuned.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   Okay, yes.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.120]   We're going to, and it's also on YouTube, they're streaming and that's where we're getting
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.120]   our stream.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.040]   We're not stealing C-Span stream.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.040]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:35.840]   Now, back to the House Judiciary Committee, which is already in progress.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.840]   We'll see you next time.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840]   Break time is over.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.840]   [Music]
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   .
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.580]   (upbeat music)
