[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.320]   This is Macbreak Weekly, episode 188 for March 31, 2010.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.480]   iPad reveal.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.800]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.120]   Welcome to a special edition of Macbreak.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.160]   We had to stop everything.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.240]   We had to talk to Andy now.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.960]   As you know, every time we chatted with Andy,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.760]   we tried to push him.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.000]   We tried to pull him.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.240]   We tried to get him to say something.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   And he was good.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880]   He was too good for us.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   But the time has come for us to talk about the iPad, of course.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.320]   So Andy, is this it?
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   Is this the illustrious iPad that we're looking at here?
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.200]   Yes, it's lovely.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   As you can see, it's pretty much exactly the same
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.440]   as what Apple promised us in the ads and in the promotional
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.000]   materials.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880]   And I'm sure a lot of people are very upset now.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.080]   So instead, I will do this.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.120]   Yoink.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.360]   Yes.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   It is indeed-- What a reveal.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   Exactly.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.440]   It's a thing called showmanship.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.360]   Ask Lady Gaga.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   She understands these things.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.760]   Yes, this is the actual real life.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.320]   I have to say that I can't help but say that I'm horribly
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   jealous.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   I'm frustrated.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480]   I've been watching videos about it.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   And I have almost out of my skin in anticipation.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.360]   So now, what are your first impressions of playing with this?
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.760]   The very first impressions were that this is the start of
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.440]   something very, very new, that there's going to be a time
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.520]   when-- I don't mean it to sound as big a momentous as it's
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560]   going to sound, but that there's going to be a time when
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.840]   just like we couldn't really remember what it was like to
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.960]   operate a computer, solely by keyboard and F keys ever since
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200]   we switched to a mouse, that there's going to be a time
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.760]   when we-- now that we didn't remember what it was like to
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720]   use a mouse and a keyboard, but that we didn't understand
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.000]   what it was like when mobile computers were not like this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.440]   Right.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.240]   Because it's such a-- I've used tablets before.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.960]   This is not my first tablet device.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.800]   I've been using it for about 10 years now.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.280]   This is the first one, though, that is so successful at what
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   it does that you would voluntarily use it instead of
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.640]   any other computer in your house for many, many, many
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.800]   situations.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920]   Well, that's been the thing, the more I've thought about it.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.880]   And it's been hard because I haven't seen anyone actually
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   use it.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.080]   I haven't seen anyone actually work with it.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.720]   But it just feels like when I start thinking about every day
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.400]   now, I've been thinking about what would I use the iPad for
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.560]   versus my laptop?
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   And I just feel like 90% of my day is really something I could
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440]   do on my iPad.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960]   That's probably very true.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.440]   Why is the focus so weird?
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I'm just talking to myself.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   No worries.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.720]   That should be much better.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.920]   That should be much sharper.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.440]   Sorry.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   I'm using these special high-def, really super cool camera.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.360]   Try to make it look a little bit better.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.960]   Yeah, well, see, it's not just a content device.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   It is actually just a full-featured computer.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   The first piece that I've put up on suntimes.com, this is
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.600]   going to be five different pieces coming up in the next
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.840]   12 hours, is just to answer the question, is it a real
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.320]   computer?
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   And if you are considering--
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   if you've got money to spend, would you like to get the
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.880]   iPad?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.120]   Would you like to get a netbook?
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.840]   Or are you going to get a notebook?
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.760]   There are three completely distinct machines with different
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.800]   pros and cons.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.760]   The difference is that now there's--
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.720]   it's not as though the iPad is going to dislodge the netbook
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   or any other computer from the marketplace.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.560]   The more you use this, the more you're aware that there was
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.160]   always this profound gap in the computer lines.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.240]   There's an iPad-shaped hole in the entire line that now has
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.360]   been filled because there are times when you don't need a
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.200]   keyboard, you don't need a mouse, you just want the
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.360]   content to be the absolute star.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.520]   And there are also times when you want to have the ability to--
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.280]   you have no real intention of using a real computer because
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.360]   you don't feel so you're going to need it.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.160]   You just head to the coffee shop for about an hour, just to
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.880]   bomb around, maybe read some mail, maybe check out some
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.000]   websites, read some books.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   But then your situation changes a little bit.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.920]   And then you're glad that you have an application like
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.640]   your pages, you're glad that the app has-- excuse me, that you
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.040]   have a device that's, by definition, a touch-based
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.000]   computer, but which also will have a really good on-screen
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   keyboard.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.920]   Let me see if I can bring that up.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.680]   Were you typing that?
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.120]   Or what was it--
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.160]   I've got this connected to the keyboard dock.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.440]   So it will work with either the Apple keyboard dock or any
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.720]   Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.000]   I actually think that the better buy between the keyboard dock
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   and this is actually get the Apple wireless keyboard.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.760]   It's just a standard Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.280]   Because as you can see, it's just as tiny and just as
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.480]   compact as the keyboard dock.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.560]   But the dock has one thing that I really don't like about it
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.080]   that--
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.600]   I'm going to turn this thing around so you can take a look at it--
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.160]   that to support the weight of the iPad, it's actually all
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   fused together like this into one simple single surface.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.800]   It's going to be hard to carry with you.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.240]   Exactly.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.840]   It's going to be almost impossible to carry with you
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.320]   as a matter of fact when I made a special trip to pick this
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.800]   baby up, along with the instructor, all the non-disclosure
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.880]   agreement that I signed, and the agreement that no one--
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.360]   I can't really use this openly or show it or let people
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.600]   see it openly.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.960]   And so now I've got this backpack that I thought was going
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.000]   to be plenty big enough for the iPad and a couple accessories.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   But the keyboard comes in this big honking box and it's this
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.720]   weird L-shaped sort of thing that just doesn't have to fold
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   down or travel or anything like that.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.480]   And I've really filled up this huge expandable backpack just
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.720]   with the bulk and the odd shape of some of these devices.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.240]   Well, and that's the thing that I worried about.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.120]   And I can definitely see myself being more interested in some
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.880]   kind of stand with the Bluetooth.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.920]   I wasn't sure how well that Bluetooth would work.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.440]   But to me, having the keyboard is because I want to sit on a
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.840]   plane and possibly work on an article or work on something
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.240]   like that.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.360]   And you want to take that dock with you, but it really looks
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.480]   like it's something more made for your home, not
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   necessarily for the road.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.600]   Exactly.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.560]   I think the purpose of the keyboard dock is just to have
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.920]   something in your office.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.680]   If you're going to be using this just sort of as a casual
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.840]   use computer setup in your living room or something like
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.520]   that, because it's nice to have an integrated dock.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   The other nice thing about the docks in general, and this is
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.760]   also true of the non-keyboard dock, is that it has multiple
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.200]   connectors in the back of it, not just baby.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.840]   Go to sleep, baby.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.720]   Not just a audio jack, but also another dock connector.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.400]   So you can, for instance--
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.680]   I think you're going to see a lot of these in conference
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.160]   rooms and places like that, where people are going to want
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.280]   to be connecting in like their camera connector and other
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.960]   things like that.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.200]   I guess I haven't actually tried.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   I do have the presentation adapter, the VGA adapter.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.600]   I have not actually tried what happens when you plug it
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.040]   into the dock, because the presentation adapter, right
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.000]   here, the VGA connector, has one limitation in that it
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.480]   can't-- unless you're going to turn your projector on its
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.040]   side, that's not going to work.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.160]   So you have to use the machine in landscape mode for that.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.760]   So I actually didn't even bother seeing what happens when
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.240]   you plug this into that.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.080]   And by the way, a couple of people on the IRC are asking
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.200]   where Leo is at this momentous occasion.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.080]   And Leo, we were kind of surprised by this opportunity.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.440]   And Leo was not available.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.320]   So I came rushing up.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.880]   Again, that's the terms of the embargo that I was under.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.400]   It was really, really difficult, because I simply had to say,
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   I think-- I don't know what you've got planned for tonight.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.880]   I've got-- I have a feeling that I
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.480]   might have something to say.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.320]   Interesting.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.480]   I can't tell you what it is.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.440]   I can't tell you what time.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.920]   Even the time that the embargo was going to lift was also
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.560]   under embargo.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   So the fact that I was under embargo also under embargo.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.840]   Absolutely.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.480]   And so Leo wasn't available.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.320]   I was more than happy to come up and see this.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.080]   Now, Andy, a couple of things.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.560]   Have you played with many application applications other
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   than the word-- other than, I'm sorry, pages and numbers
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.640]   and those types of things?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.400]   What are their applications have you played with?
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.480]   Well, at this stage-- let me watch the App Store for you.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.640]   At this stage, the App Store is active,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.680]   but it hasn't really been populated yet.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   It just has a handful of apps that are out there,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.560]   chiefly so that guys like us who are reviewing this
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.400]   can see what it's like to download apps.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.240]   There's probably maybe about a dozen of them out there right
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.400]   now, including a Twitter client, including Omni Grafel.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   How did Omni Grafel work?
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.520]   That was actually when I was really fascinated by it.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.280]   Well, I have not--
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.120]   I've tried Omni Grafel in simulator.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.680]   I have not downloaded it yet.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   Right.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.360]   So these demo machines are the complete working thing.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.000]   However, I do have to plug in my own user--
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.720]   my own Apple Store ID in order to make purchases.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.040]   And that's a $50 thing.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.440]   And I don't really have much interest in Omni Grafel.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.760]   I'll show you something that's really quite successful.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.480]   This is what's going to sell these things.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.000]   Yes, it is air hockey for the iPad.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.400]   And this is the reason why basically productivity kind of--
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.800]   this is my Plants vs. whatever.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.320]   Oh, man.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.240]   And it's big enough to do this.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.600]   You really couldn't do this with the iPhone.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.400]   I think that's the thing is that there's a lot of things
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.160]   that we could see were possible with the iPhone,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.840]   but it just wasn't big enough.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.760]   It just wasn't--
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   Right.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   Now, Plants vs. Zombies is not available yet.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.840]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   Now, obviously, on Saturday, I'm sure
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.560]   we're going to see a big explosion in apps.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   Apple has promised a substantial library of applications
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.880]   are going to be available on launch day.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.600]   As a matter of fact, today, I got a whole bunch of sample
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.560]   videos and press releases and just email shoutouts
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   from developers saying, hey, our app got approved.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.320]   We're going to be available on Saturday.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.840]   If you already have an iPad, you have a device ID, let us know,
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.160]   because we can get this going for you.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.840]   But yeah, there's so many different things about this
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.880]   that are just totally going to blow your mind.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.800]   Like, of course, Scrabble, obviously,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.400]   you're thinking that the idea of having Scrabble
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.600]   on a real big playing board, already, that's a huge win.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.760]   But it's a great demonstration of how sophisticated
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.240]   the APIs are in here.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.000]   I'll just-- let me just tap that so you can just--
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.120]   yes, let's restore that game.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   So already, you're doing just fine just having this big layout
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.440]   in which you can just pull letters and drag them out there.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.200]   But ad hoc networking through Bluetooth
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.960]   is a huge feature of the iPad.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.880]   So this is what the Scrabble app can do.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.240]   Yes, it's a commercial application, a commercial game.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.760]   And if you want to play it with like three or four friends,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.120]   you can do so just throughout this application.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.560]   But these people behind Scrabble,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.280]   they realize that a lot of your friends probably
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.520]   have iPod touches and iPhones.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.080]   And so they've released a free Scrabble client,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.840]   or they're going to release a free Scrabble client
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.320]   for your for the iPhone and the iPod touch.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.520]   So that if you're at the cafe or whatever,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.120]   and sitting around this table, you
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.920]   can run these client applications.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   And all these four-- this iPad touch--
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.720]   this iPad is four iPod touches will essentially
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.640]   be one big collaborative Scrabble system where
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   each player's individual iPhone will have their own private Scrabble
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.760]   rack.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   And then when they-- you can rearrange the tiles,
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.560]   and get your own private score, player with certain--
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.720]   So they're not necessarily seeing the whole--
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.080]   they're looking at your iPad.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.520]   So they can sit around your iPad and then add the only--
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.600]   The only-- in this multiplayer mode,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.800]   like right now, again, there's no one else using this
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.280]   with these iPod and iPhone client apps.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   But so this is just the entire thing.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.880]   And so you'd have to pretty much pass this around.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.320]   With these client apps installed,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.680]   it's just like playing regular Scrabble,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.320]   because you have your own iPhone that only shows you
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.280]   your own rack tile.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.720]   And the only person who can see that rack
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.240]   is you on this private personal device.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.680]   And so when it's your turn to play,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.840]   you can rearrange them just like you would in Scrabble.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.320]   It's time when you decide what tiles you want to play,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.720]   you just simply flick them off of the iPhone.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   And then they simply land on the board
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.120]   and they simply play them out.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.760]   And there are a bunch of games and a bunch of apps
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.720]   that will work exactly that way.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.320]   And zero configurations, zero permissions, zero nothing.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.000]   It just simply recognizes that there are these client apps
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.160]   within the immediate vicinity.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.920]   And yes, let's all play Scrabble together.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.880]   Wow.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.960]   That's-- yeah.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.480]   And Scrabble-- this is a big thing for Scrabble,
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.200]   because there was another application.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.920]   I can't think of the name of it right now.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   They had really taken-- you know,
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.560]   had done basically Scrabble online and Scrabulous.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.840]   And they really needed to take that back.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.480]   I mean, they needed to create something that was compelling.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   That looks great.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.840]   See, this is-- I hate to just show you games,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.040]   but this is going to be the ultimate gaming platform.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.360]   This is almost like having a portable Wii with you,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.800]   because if you imagine how well this will work
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.880]   with a racing game--
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   Oh, no.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.160]   I'm starting to get the idea.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   Right.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.560]   So you're steering just by tilting the touch.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.200]   I've got this on auto--
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.440]   I've got this on auto-accelerate.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.920]   I've got to break myself, though.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.040]   But yeah, this is why--
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   no, let me point out how bad the situation
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.760]   was for me, because I picked this up in New York.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.680]   I had a three and a half hour--
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   See, I'm trying to talk about it.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.520]   Train that you couldn't--
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.200]   I'm a distracted driver, yes.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.120]   So I was three and a half hours on a train home.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.040]   I had this with all these games and apps, like installed--
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.520]   Oh, thank you.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.320]   --in my bag, but I had to leave it inside the bag.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   Sometimes life is--
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.560]   well, there are people who suffer more than I do,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.360]   but sometimes you feel as though there are nobody.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   There's nobody who suffers more than you do.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.000]   I know I have like six flights next week,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.520]   and I'm just like, oh, I'm going to be on those flights.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.960]   And I'm not going to have any problems taking it out.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.640]   And doodling with it.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.440]   Now, is there anything that you felt was lacking?
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.280]   Is anything missing for you that you really--
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.200]   I really wish they had added something?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.840]   The way that it handles files is it's decent.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.080]   It's acceptable, but it's not brilliant,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.880]   and it's not the best you can do.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.720]   A couple of developers were telling me
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.640]   about how they understood files to work on the iPad
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.320]   a couple of months ago, which filled me with a lot of joy.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.560]   But the reality is a lot more restrictive.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.720]   Apple feels as though having an unrestricted file system
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.400]   that the users can tamper with and which other apps can tamper
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.240]   with leads to nothing but trouble.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.120]   And so for that reason, there's a lot of control
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.920]   that they retain that will not allow you to.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.480]   So if you want to put your own documents on this thing,
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.400]   there are a couple of different conduits to do it.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.760]   The easiest way is to do it via iTunes,
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.400]   where right in the Applications tab--
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.560]   it shows up in iTunes just like another device similar to an iPod
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.720]   or an iPhone.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.560]   And there's an Applications tab.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.080]   The new twist is that each application also
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.480]   has a little pane inside its little preferences.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   If this application is capable of exporting and importing
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.400]   files, you can simply drag files into that in Settings,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.920]   and it will simply be copied into that application's private--
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.560]   Can you drag them out of there as well?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.600]   So if you're saving pages, documents,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.240]   is that where you get them?
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.200]   If you import a document into Pages,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.680]   it becomes a Pages document.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   You then when you go into your own personal library, then--
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   How do you get them back out of Pages after you've typed them?
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.920]   I'm about to tell you.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   You do have to use an explicit export command.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.680]   It's not as though there's a free-floating folder.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.800]   But the way the widget is not a lose
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.600]   is that the operating system also understands the idea
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.840]   that certain apps can claim certain file types.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.720]   And there's also a universal feature that
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.360]   is available to developers that will allow one app to sort of allow
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.240]   the user to do something productive with a file.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:59.920]   The most visible way of doing this is through the Mail client.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.800]   I better not show you my personal mail.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.720]   That is my personal mail.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.840]   The best way to do that is through the Mail client,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.120]   where someone emails you a Word file as an attachment.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.880]   It will use the built-in quick-look feature
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.240]   to simply, without even having to launch another application,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.760]   show you the contents of that file
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.080]   and let you read the whole thing.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.880]   If you then want to edit it, you simply--
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.360]   there's a button called that'll be labeled open with.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.680]   And at that point, they absolutely ask the operating system,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.080]   great, this person wants to open this Word file,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.200]   giving a list of all applications on this device that
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.960]   have told the OS that it's capable of dealing with Word files.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.040]   It will present you with a list, and then you explicitly
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.960]   have to tap which application you want to launch with this thing.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.640]   So it's not as though you double-click on the file
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.840]   and it launches like an application automatically.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.920]   Application launching has to be done explicitly by the user.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   So the user feels as though they have a certain amount of control
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.080]   there.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.200]   A couple questions from the IRC.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.760]   One is experience of battery life.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.440]   What's your experience with the battery life?
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   Battery life is freaking awesome.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   My usual-- Apple says, Apple promises 10 hours of battery life.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.960]   And usually, you either have that or 2/3 or 3/4 of it.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.360]   You know that that's probably a best-case scenario.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.440]   But I did a 100% to 0% drain in two different modes.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.520]   The first time I tried to be as aggressive as possible in power
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.560]   during I had the screen brightness all the way up.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.280]   I had the volume.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.480]   I was using everything for the speaker,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.280]   and I had the volume all the way up.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.920]   And throughout the day, I was watching movies.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.560]   I was getting mail.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.280]   I was playing games.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.560]   I was using-- the transacting via Wi-Fi.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.160]   And even with the most aggressive use, I can imagine,
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.760]   I was getting between 6 and 1/2 and 7 hours worth of use.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.280]   When I simply dropped down to something more practical,
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.560]   I set this brightness to-- now, this brightness is at 1/2.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.840]   So this is at 50%.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.560]   And it's perfectly readable and perfectly great.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.080]   The volume I set down to 1/2.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.840]   And when I watched a movie on it, I actually listened
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.720]   to the headphones.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.480]   And I got 11 hours of battery life out of it.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.120]   So you can absolutely-- it was amazing how quickly
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.560]   I fell into the mode of, oh, yes, the iPad.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.360]   I'll just take the iPad with me.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.480]   No, I don't need it to take my notebook and deliver
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   a one-hour watch, Myth Bus.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.840]   But I'll just take the iPad.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.120]   That's what I'll do.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.480]   So a question-- have you been able to test--
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.760]   we were talking some of the issues around the VGA output.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.600]   Is it something that is a dedicated only to the app?
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.800]   Or is it something that-- do we get to see the display?
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.240]   Is that possible?
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.840]   No.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.400]   It's a feature that has to be explicitly supported by the app.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.640]   Also, the external display is something very, very special.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   It's not a mirrored display.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.280]   The application designer is going
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.320]   to have to consider when this adapter is plugged in,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.920]   what do we want to have on this screen that the--
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.600]   someone who has control the interface will want to control,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.200]   and what do we want to throw up on that external display?
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.520]   For instance, in Keynote, if you have this plugged in,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.960]   obviously the external display is going
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.920]   to show your presentation, whereas this
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   is going to show you in landscape mode
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.360]   a rack of all your slides.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.760]   You can scroll through and see what you're
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.880]   going to teleport from place to another.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.440]   A controller as you can go back next.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.960]   It also has a virtual laser pointer.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.680]   Just a little virtual trackpad so that you can hold down
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.320]   and drag, and it will draw out a burning red dot in the middle
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.240]   of the screen so you can illustrate what you're doing.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.760]   Did you try any real Keynotes?
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.280]   Did you push it at all as far as the Keynote display?
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.680]   The reason I'm asking is that I'm trying to weigh whether I'm
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.720]   going to try to do my NAB presentations on my iPad,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.760]   just because I can.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.520]   It looks beautiful.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.240]   It pumps out a full HD resolution,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.320]   the full resolution of the iPad.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.160]   If you're putting it onto--
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.840]   if you go from this onto a wide screen HD display,
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.080]   you can't control whether it gets window box or stretched.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.240]   It will be stretched in a distorted to fit
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.040]   the dimensions of the HD--
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.640]   excuse me, of the wide screen aspect ratio.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.920]   But otherwise, it looks absolutely perfect.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.440]   The only drawback to it is that you cannot load in your own fonts
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.160]   onto the device.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.200]   So you're limited to the 33, 34 fonts that are built into the system.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   You think that's going to be something--
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.160]   as we get into this thing where we're creating stuff,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.000]   do you think that's going to become more of an issue?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.440]   What happens if I create a page's document, for instance,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.160]   that is, got a specific font, and then I bring it into here,
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.320]   am I going to lose that font?
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.080]   Is it going to get converted to Helvetica?
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.040]   I believe it or not, I haven't round tripped a font that
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.240]   has custom fonts.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.920]   I was only doing that with keynote presentations
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.320]   and other things.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   I think that the mode that you want to get into, at least
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.120]   with the page's application, is that you're not there to--
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.960]   you're not there to write a 40 page report on this.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.760]   You're there to take the 40 page report
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.360]   that you started in another document, another system.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   Do your edits.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.160]   Write another five or six or seven or eight pages,
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.560]   and then spit it out again.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.800]   It's sort of something for carrying it around,
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.120]   editing it, creating it, manipulating it.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.520]   I'm absolutely 100% certain, though, that before too long.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.080]   If not as soon as Saturday, we're
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   going to see a suite of very, very muscular office apps
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.520]   for this device.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.360]   Because keynote and pages and numbers,
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.840]   they're very, very sophisticated.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.880]   There's a lot that you can do with them,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.120]   including making pretty complicated documents
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.600]   and pretty complicated reports.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.320]   Here's a sample that--
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.880]   Well, and part of one of the things we were talking about
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.200]   on the show was that I feel like that pages are
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600]   the perfect-- one of the perfect plate ways
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.680]   to create documents or even e-books for the iPad.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.280]   Now, if you can do it in the iPad,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.200]   I think that creates some kind of circular loop.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.720]   I'm not sure that I agree with you.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.880]   I don't think that Apple will see this
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.440]   as a lifestyle computer, as a destination in and of itself.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.640]   I also don't think that Steve Jobs would
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.120]   do to the Macintosh with the iPad, what he did,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.240]   to the lease a line with the Macintosh.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.280]   Because now he's the CEO of the company.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.080]   He has no-- he'll keep you cutting off his own nose
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.800]   by doing that.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.200]   Right.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.160]   Now, the other questions-- heat.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.360]   Is heat really an issue?
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.160]   Is it something you can set on your legs
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.760]   and not get uncomfortable?
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.320]   It is an absolute non-issue.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.720]   There is no heat being generated from this at all.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.160]   Wow.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.960]   It is as cool to the touch at the end of three hours
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.080]   as is at the beginning.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.520]   At the end of a two-hour movie, it
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.760]   is the exact same temperature as it is at the beginning.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.040]   And of course, no fan, so it's absolutely silent.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.440]   But one thing I wanted to show you,
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.920]   look how fast the scrolling is on this.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.000]   It is like you cannot get faster than this.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.840]   Oh, it just looks like a window into another world.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.040]   I mean, so I'm doing this.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.480]   Now, watch as I do that, which is faster.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.520]   Right.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.040]   So it is just as fast as just doing a camera zoom in and out.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.240]   For that reason, this browser is uniquely--
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.160]   it is as good as any web browsing experience
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.600]   that I've had anywhere else.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.480]   Because I just love the fact that navigating through the page
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.160]   is so fast and so quick and so easy.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.040]   For instance, even on a desktop,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.600]   like this is how I usually read my comic strips of this website
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.800]   that sort of finds the RSS feeds and builds RSS feeds
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   from content.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.560]   And sometimes you certainly have to scroll in and out.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.680]   You have to command keys to zoom in and out with this.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.480]   You just sort of tip it in.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   We're good.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.000]   We're good.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.760]   OK, done with that.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.480]   So now this brings up a key question, though.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.720]   I mean, because you're the perfect person to tell us,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.880]   have you been able to try any kind of look
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.040]   at any comic books on the iPad?
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.680]   Not really.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.720]   Unfortunately, there just aren't any apps for that.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.920]   And the iPad is just a terrible, terrible device for that.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.760]   I mean, if only a Compa company would ever
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.360]   develop their own custom app for selling contents on the iPad.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.600]   Unfortunately, I mean, that's just never going to happen.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.960]   I mean, I put together this mock up
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.200]   of what a Marvel Comics reader app would look like
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.920]   if they were ever write a custom app for the iPad.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.240]   I mean, I suppose you'd be able to navigate their content
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.880]   like that.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.960]   And if you like this issue, you could simply tap a download
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.000]   button.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And it would be delivered to your device just that quickly
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.800]   and just that easily.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.480]   And then when you're finally done with it,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.440]   you could just go through all your comics
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.200]   and just read them one at a time.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.720]   But of course, that's just crazy talk.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.200]   I mean, I like to live in this fantasy land where such things
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.480]   are even possible.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.120]   Yes, this was a big surprise.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.880]   I have a lot of apps that have not been released yet
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.360]   and have no release dates yet.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.880]   Some of the stuff is actually pre-release.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.080]   So I did not know about the Marvel Comics app
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.800]   until it simply appeared on this iPad.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.040]   Apple has been-- this device came to me preloaded
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.360]   with content because they were also
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.840]   not able to get me a copy of iTunes 9.1, which
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.760]   is absolutely necessary for putting
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   your own custom content on the device.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.520]   So they started me off by just getting this thing set up
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.040]   the way that some people would use it.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.800]   And you can also tell that there must be certain apps
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.600]   that they're particularly proud of that they think get it
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.080]   in terms of what the iPad should be
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.960]   and what the interface should be like
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.000]   because they certainly didn't put junky applications on there.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.280]   But this is just absolutely done correctly.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.240]   When you have this set up in portrait mode like this,
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.560]   the comic book pages, about 80% the size on the screen
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.280]   as it would be on a printed page.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.120]   But the display is so good that you can easily read all
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.920]   the panels and all the pages.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.960]   How was your experience of using this outside, inside,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.640]   compared, of course, it's going to get
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.480]   compared to the Kindle?
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.640]   Well, let me finish showing you this.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.120]   This also has a really cool mode that I enjoy where
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.760]   if you don't like having it all scrunched down like that,
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.040]   if you're in landscape mode, you just do next page,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.160]   back page, it will just steer the camera from panel to panel
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.200]   and moment of action and moment of action.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   So--
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.240]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.360]   And this is just the first comic book application
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.120]   that we've seen live on the iPad.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.440]   And I could not put my own content on it.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.080]   Marvel has many fantastic books and many of them
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.640]   are available through the store.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.200]   But I'm like, I want Amanda Carter's power girl issues
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.840]   one through 10 on my iPad.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.080]   I haven't already seen the first episode.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.160]   Can I get watchmen on the iPad, sir?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.680]   But this is-- I'm sure that as soon as people see this--
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.000]   and this is the Marvel Comics app--
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.960]   I haven't reviewed it yet because it's pre-release,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.320]   but I felt that it was cool enough that I had to write about it,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   at least as a preview.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   And so that's another piece that's
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   going to be up on "Sondheim's Tonight" or "Tmoramorn."
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.880]   It's actually in the hopper.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.120]   We have time bombs set to each one of these pieces.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.640]   But yeah, I'm really excited about it.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.680]   One of the recap for some people asking.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   This is, of course, we are covering the new iPad.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.240]   I'm sitting in for Leo.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.840]   And we're here with Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.120]   And his embargo was lifted.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.040]   And we had to jump right on that opportunity
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.320]   to make sure that we got to the Twitter listeners,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.360]   or Twitter viewers, got this out to them as soon as possible.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.920]   Now, one of the questions that's coming up a couple times
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.200]   on the IRC is printing.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.600]   Have you tried printing from your iPad?
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's a very simple procedure.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.160]   You just take it as it is.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.560]   You lay it on top of any flatbed scanner.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   You scan the image as it is, and then you print it from the Mac.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   No, it does not support in any way, shape, or form printing.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.440]   Really?
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.240]   So there's no way to get out of it.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.480]   There is no way to get out of it right now.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.560]   There is-- now, there are iPhone apps
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.360]   that will print via Wi-Fi or through other bits of trickery.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.920]   I'm sure we're going to see that happen soon enough.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   But unfortunately--
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.080]   It just seems surprising.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.840]   It seems almost amazing that Apple, who can do--
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.200]   I mean, you're on a Wi-Fi network.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.440]   You've got printers that are hooked up to Wi-Fi networks.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.040]   It seems crazy that Apple wouldn't
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.200]   be able to print to those printers from the iPad.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.320]   Well, the difficulty there is simply that.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.560]   How do you deal with the idea of having
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.360]   like 100 different device drivers on this device?
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.280]   100 different device drivers that Apple is certainly
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.800]   not going to trust Epson and HP and the rest of those guys
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.680]   to write for them.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.240]   What will it do to the stability device?
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   What will it do to the capacity of the device?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.480]   The alternative that I was thinking is, well, fine Apple.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.120]   So just have a client app that goes onto Windows and Mac
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.440]   that will simply allow this device to simply find
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.400]   this print server over Wi-Fi, send it a PDF of what
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.920]   it thinks the thing should do like,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.160]   then have that client apps simply grab the PDF,
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.080]   and then print it using whatever the local printer driver is.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.720]   But maybe they simply-- there comes a time when they have to--
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.120]   you imagine that discussion that they're
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.600]   having in the conference room like early on in the development
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.640]   where they simply have to make the decision,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.800]   is this going to be used like a desktop computer,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.200]   or is this going to be used as an accessory to a desktop
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.560]   computer, or are we designing something that
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.680]   is going to have its own definition that we can make
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.440]   our own rules?
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.080]   And I think this is-- that's a key thing.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.920]   I think that part of what I looked at when I see this,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.160]   I just feel like this could be a replacement for a desktop
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.040]   or a laptop for many, many people.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.880]   But without the ability to print,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.800]   that means that everyone's still got to be tethered somewhere.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.560]   I think that if you're using--
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.200]   this is a piece that-- the first piece that hit the sometimes.com.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.560]   I spend about 2,000 words explaining the pros and the--
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.680]   the functional pros and cons of the iPad in relationship
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.920]   to netbooks and notebooks.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.560]   And one of the conclusions that I feel I have to come to
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.320]   after a week of using this is that if you want to use this
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.520]   as a prime computer, you're probably going to be disappointed
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.760]   because it's a fallacy that the iPad does not do multitasking.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.640]   Of course, it does do multitasking.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.840]   If you can play music in the background,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.800]   if you've rented or purchased a movie via iTunes,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.840]   you can just go away from that application
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.720]   and start web surfing or use any other app,
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.640]   and the download will continue in the background.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.720]   However, even though even if you are using multiple apps
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.480]   at the same time, it's still a one screen, one window
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.120]   at a time interface.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   And that is kind of a bummer to get through when you've got to--
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.080]   when you want to look something up on Wikipedia
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.400]   or look something up on the newspaper site,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.520]   get that data out, then move it back into pages,
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.800]   or move it back into the report that you're working with.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.960]   It's just a big, big frickin' hassle.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.120]   Also, the big deal about the iPad for a lot of people
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.600]   is probably going to be these single most stable computer
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.160]   you own.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.360]   It's going to be the one computer that never freezes up,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.480]   the one that never needs to do a hard reset.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.120]   But it has to get hard resetted in about once a year.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.480]   And so you just don't want a complication to come in
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.760]   that will just screw that up for you.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.000]   Well, the only exception that I would make for it
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   is that if you do have a relative who only wants a computer
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.640]   to do the web, to do the email,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.440]   a vacationing, write some letters,
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.600]   that's going to be perfectly okay.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.000]   The only things that you need to necessarily tether this
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.520]   to a desktop to make it work,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.640]   the only thing you absolutely cannot do with it
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.040]   is you can't do a backup from it
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.560]   until you tether it to a desktop machine.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.320]   Also, you can't apply a system update
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   until you tether it to a machine.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.080]   So there are a couple limited situations
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.200]   in which you can use it as a replacement
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.400]   for a conventional computer,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.040]   but mostly you should think about it as an iPad.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.800]   Well, now, I said iPad.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.240]   So there's been a lot of talk about the price
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.080]   and the availability of newspapers and magazines.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.320]   Have you been able to take a look at some of those?
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.280]   Newspaper apps have not shown up yet
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.200]   and either have magazine apps at this point.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.560]   The iBook store is open with a great many titles,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   but a great many categories are also missing at this point.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.240]   For instance, I was happy to find that one
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.120]   of my favorite books was available for it already.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.240]   It seems like every time I buy a new device escape,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.960]   every time there's a new format for reading something,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.520]   I have to buy Michael Palin's on about memoirs.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.360]   (laughing)
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.200]   It's just, so if this is--
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.960]   - You have it in every version.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.520]   - Exactly, I have it on Kindle.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.840]   I bought it on iBooks.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.080]   I knew that that's one thing I could definitely
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.880]   want to have fun with and read.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.360]   I've got an audiobook, I've got it on Patreon.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.760]   Let's go back to the store.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.400]   Unfortunately, the last time I checked,
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.280]   which was this afternoon,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.080]   they haven't really populated all the categories yet.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.520]   - Right.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.240]   So now again, and also coming back to,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.760]   coming back to the question of, you're outside.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.200]   You open it up, you want to read it.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.320]   Are you comfortable outside?
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.520]   Is it readable?
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.440]   How is it compared to the Kindle?
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.600]   - Well, yeah, Kindle's been talking a little bit of trash
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.800]   saying that they're trying not to acknowledge
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.120]   that the iPad actually exists
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.840]   while acknowledging that they're scared,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   spitless about it.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.880]   So there's an ad that's actually on the,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.040]   there's an ad that's actually,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.800]   ooh, that's the first time I've ever seen an app
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.120]   not launch, interesting.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.480]   So they're making the point that,
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.000]   hey, this is readable even in bright sunlight.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.040]   They have a picture of like the,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.840]   now the famous, like with all these hardware demos,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.800]   like for phone demos,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.680]   the famous explain in hand, you know.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.520]   - Right.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.120]   - Holding a Kindle at the beach.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.440]   So it was Saturday and it was a intensely bright,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.680]   sun, shiny day with not a cloud in the sky.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.080]   So even though it was 28 degrees outside,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.720]   I drove to the beach and tried to see how easy it is to read,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.880]   read books, the books app on a bright, sunny day.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.960]   And it's perfectly readable.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.920]   It's not the optimal display possible for this device.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.760]   But I would,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.520]   - But neither is it in the beach.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.000]   I don't know for me, now there's a book.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.280]   It always seems like it's too bright anyway.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   - Yeah, well, I mean, what I was gonna say is that
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.400]   I would liken it to like a Kindle in indoor lighting
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.560]   without having a book light or something
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.480]   going directly on it.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.320]   It's readable, but sub-optimal.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.080]   Obviously the optimum circumstance for a Kindle
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.360]   is at the beach and bright sunlight.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.920]   But frankly, I'm very, very rarely in bright,
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.560]   intense sunlight reading a book.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.240]   Usually it's in a room like this,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.720]   or on a car or in a coffee shop or something like that.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.200]   And frankly, I would much rather have a device
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.920]   that has its own built-in book light
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.120]   than have something that I have to turn something on
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.000]   and angle it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.640]   If there's one thing that affects the display performance,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.360]   it's just the fact that this is a very glossy screen.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   So it's not a case of,
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   I don't want people to think that it's a case
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.920]   of finding the one angle which you can read it well at.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.640]   It's more like avoiding the one angle
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.920]   where you can't read it at.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.280]   - Right, now, and also some questions from the IRC.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.120]   People are asking, can you change the color of the text?
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.960]   Can you change the color of display
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   for low visibility users and people who just wanna flip
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.820]   the text or invert the text?
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.440]   - Indeed, there's a great, great many,
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.880]   there is a great, great many usability,
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   or is it, I think it is in, accessibility, there we go.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.240]   There are great many features here.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.520]   You can switch this to a white on black display,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.080]   just like that.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.120]   It also has a speakable items built into it.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   It has a text zoom.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:34.520]   So instead of having zoom just affect,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.960]   web page and stuff like that,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.280]   we'll simply zoom the entire display
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.640]   to make it easier to read.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:45.160]   For if you have a low vision also,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.280]   you can turn on a mode in which it will just speak.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.000]   It will sort of make the first tap that you do
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.960]   on anywhere not to be an actual user interface tap,
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.760]   but simply a speak, whatever I've got
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.120]   on a run finger right now.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.560]   And that's the second tap that will actually
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.160]   register as the click.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.640]   So for people with poor hearing, poor sight, poor vision,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.560]   there's lots and lots of features in here.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.120]   It also speak any page in the book.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   I did test it out.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.760]   It won't read the entire book for you,
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.320]   but you can just simply flip a page
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.800]   and then we'll read that book, that book, that page.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.360]   Only one voice is available.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.680]   You don't get the full capital collection.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.520]   - Who do you get?
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.800]   Who do you stuck with?
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.200]   - Oh goodness, it is a game.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:30.400]   Nope, that's, oops.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.440]   - It's interesting, there'd only be one voice for it.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.800]   - Yeah, it's a woman that has the same accent
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.160]   as whatever localization you've have chosen for that.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.400]   For the device.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.240]   - Okay.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.320]   Now the,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.720]   I had another question now.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.080]   I lost it, I lost it.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.400]   - That's okay.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.560]   One thing I wanna go back to though,
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.040]   is that I keep double checking the categories
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.960]   because the bookstore has a number of books in it,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.040]   but it's not fully stocked yet.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.720]   And so the number of categories here is pretty enticing.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.440]   You can imagine how good like cookbooks are gonna be
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.640]   with this full color screen,
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.960]   but it also has a,
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.680]   where is it?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:26.040]   Oh my God, they have removed something.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.760]   - What did they take out?
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   - They take a double check.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.000]   There used to be a comic books,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.560]   a graphic novels section here,
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.280]   but it has been removed.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.720]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.200]   Yeah, see that's something that was really keen
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.040]   on checking out because I always thought that the smart way
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   to do that would be to have,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.520]   let companies like Panelfly and Iverse and Comixology,
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.200]   Comixology by the way, are the makers of that Marvel app.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.040]   If you look through the Get Infos,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.520]   there's an acknowledgement that they're using
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.800]   a Comixology's engine.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.600]   I always thought that it's starting last year
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.080]   that that was the smart way for them to do it
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.920]   because the needs of a comic book reader
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.360]   are gonna be so much different from the needs
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.160]   of a standard book reader.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.040]   So I was curious to see how come that was now
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.560]   its own category here and how they would actually do that.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.400]   So it looks like that I'm guessing then
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.200]   that was just a placeholder that has now disappeared.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.280]   That a bunch of new categories seem to arrive to,
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.600]   I have a couple of screenshots that I took
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.960]   of how these things work.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.400]   Oh, one of the thing that I should mention,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.120]   which is I was really curious to see
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   if this would be the case.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.720]   Almost every, almost all of these books
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.800]   also have a free sample available.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.560]   So you can download and try before you would buy,
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.720]   just right here I've just chosen to download
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.160]   the sample of the top secret restaurant recipes,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.400]   Volume Two.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.680]   I'll see if I can follow the story,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.520]   even though I've missed Volume One.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:54.520]   I also noticed that a lot of these samples
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.720]   are really generous.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.100]   One sample book had 132 pages to it.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.820]   Give me a recipe.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.100]   Come on, you better go.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.380]   There's the Applebee's mudslide.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.300]   There you go.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.100]   You can make all kinds of adjustments,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   you can make the font size.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.100]   Well, this is still just a basic book that's put there.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   I mean, what's really going to be interesting
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   is when book companies really start to customize for this
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   and really start to find ways to use this.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   I really think that some voice activation
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   mixed with some good recipes could really add up
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.100]   to a great cooking experience.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.100]   It definitely could be.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   I saw an app, I don't think it's on here,
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.100]   but I saw a, there you go, I'd be curious.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.100]   So that's probably more like what you're talking about,
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:40.100]   a dedicated app that has all kinds of extra media on it.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.100]   For instance, over here, you have a much more colorful list
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.100]   of recipes.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   There's the Tangerine and Pizzeco Sorbet.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.100]   Here's the ingredients, just on one separate list here.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.100]   And also, I believe it also has some,
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.100]   I want to get the ingredients back,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.100]   you just pull that back.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   So it's a good thing to actually have.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   You can move, as you make your way through the recipe,
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   you can sort of move the spark or two where you were,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   where you are and actually putting this together.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.100]   See, it's going to be interesting to see the division
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   between the limitations of what you can do with an ePub
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   document in the iBook store and the breaking point
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   at which certain content providers are going to say,
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.100]   okay, you know what, we have a vision for this content
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.100]   that goes far beyond what this app is,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.100]   what this app is letting us do.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   You know, it's funny, I was talking,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.100]   I ended up on my long bus ride here.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.100]   We were in the rain, it was very delayed,
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.100]   and person sitting next to me happened to work
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   at a publishing company.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.100]   And so, of course, everyone's talking about it.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   And for them, you know, applications are what they're going to have.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.100]   They decide they're going to build.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.100]   They're very graphic.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.100]   They're very, the stuff that they're doing,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   they just said, you know,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   an e-book is not going to do what we wanted to do.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.100]   We're going to have to move to developing some kind of,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.100]   you know, custom application or series of custom applications.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   You know, it's just not going to work.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.100]   Again, I'm glad to see that people,
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.100]   that these guys are going to have the choice of making whatever sort of app they want.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   In many ways, this is the ultimate,
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.100]   that's another piece that's on the SunTimes.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.100]   It is the ultimate e-book reader in the sense that
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.100]   there is nothing that this device cannot read for you.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.100]   This has only a fraction of it.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   Apple has told me, I believe that they're going to have 60,000 books
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   upon the opening of the iBook store.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.100]   30,000 of those are public domain titles from Project Gutenberg.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.100]   Meanwhile, Amazon.com was only too pleased to tell me that they have
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   450,000 titles in their library.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   But the thing is that they are,
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.100]   they've also announced they're coming out with an iPad application.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   So any book that's available through Amazon will also be available
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.100]   to your iPad via this second app.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.100]   You'll have to launch a different app in order to read it.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.100]   But it seems as though if you want one device that will rule them all,
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   that will be able to read any sort of content that you ever want to get a hold of,
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.100]   your choice is going to be the iPad.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.100]   It really seems like this is really the first,
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.100]   I mean a lot of people have called themselves this,
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.100]   but this seems like it's really the first convergent device.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.100]   Like the truly convergent play anything, look at anything.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.100]   I mean, not anything, but all the different forms of media,
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:20.100]   it just seems like it's, I mean, that's handheld and easy and really part of that process.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.100]   Okay.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   Oh, no, I'm just, I didn't know if that's the way you felt,
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.100]   that's the way you felt or not.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.100]   I mean, it just seems like as a truly a consumer device,
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   like I want to consume media, I want to consume any kind of media,
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   and I want to do it comfortably.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.100]   You see, it's really, I should mention that my frame rate is a little bit low right now.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   This is video playback is completely smooth and perfectly high definition right here.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.100]   It's, what I love about the iPad is what I loved about the original iPod.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.100]   There's a reason why the original iPod was given this vague name that can mean anything
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   because they wanted to create the impression that you could do anything you want with this device.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.100]   It wasn't just an MP3 player that eventually it'll be for all kinds of different content.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:07.100]   And so this is damn near close to the one device that you can always carry with you
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.100]   and always have a solution at hand.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.100]   It'll be a really great document cabinet.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.100]   It could be used for all the books that you're reading.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.100]   It could be used for all the music that you're listening to, all the movies you're watching.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.100]   There's, I can't think of a single form of media that this cannot handle.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.100]   PDFs, did you play with PDFs?
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.100]   How did it work?
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.100]   Okay.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.100]   PDFs do work within Quickview.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:33.100]   There is not a built-in application that is just a standard PDF document cabinet and storage place.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.100]   I'm sure that's going to be covered by third party apps.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:40.100]   I've been talking to developers of some of the most popular document storage apps
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   and cloud storage services for the iPhone and for the general internet.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.100]   And they're all getting into the iPad in a major, major way.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:52.100]   So for instance, I'm sure that you're going to see the ability to print apps from an app
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:58.100]   like Air Sharing when they come up with their iPad app because that's something that can be done in other versions.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:04.100]   And also, that app is in the business of collecting your documents and letting you do useful things with them.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.100]   Right.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.100]   Now, when you were reading with this, did you find that you could read for a long period of time?
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.100]   Was there any eye strain?
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.100]   Was there any trouble with making that work?
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.100]   No, not at all.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:20.100]   It did take a few seconds to get used to the typeface.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.100]   I'm used to reading my Kindle.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   And so the Kindle is much, much sharper, much higher contrast.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   And so my eyes were like, "Hey, wait a minute.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.100]   This isn't our Kindle."
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   But you get over that really quickly.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   And within seconds, I'm just in the process of reading a book.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   I'm not even thinking, "Well, isn't this a little bit of reading a book on an iPad?"
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   I'm just reading a book.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.100]   The same is true of watching movies on this.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:55.100]   One of the sample movies that they put on, one of the movies that they put on for me was up a movie that I had never seen before.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   Because for one reason or another, I just never got around to seeing it.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.100]   And so I'm just sort of lying on the sofa.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.100]   Oh, so this is the one when you were Twitter-ing about up.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   You were watching it on the iPad.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.100]   Exactly.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.100]   Oh, dirty rut and sound.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.100]   So that's...
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.100]   Yep.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.100]   I had to be very careful.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:18.100]   The other problem was that I was being very, very careful not to use it on Open Wifi networks just in case it was broadcasting like a device ID that would get killed.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   There is a copy of Twitter-rific on this.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   And I'm like, "Okay, now I'm sure that the makers of Twitter-rific..."
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:30.100]   Or when they put this on the device, they weren't silly enough to set it up so that it says, "Posed by Twitter-rific for iPad."
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.100]   Because that would probably be a problem for a lot of people.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   But getting back to this.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:40.100]   So again, I was just really kind of wanting to see what is it like to launch these apps?
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   You can see these really cool little animations that they do just to sort of show off their sense of style.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:54.100]   But within like 30 seconds, I was just enjoying this HD movie and just getting into the movie itself.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.100]   And I wound up just lying there on the sofa, watching this entire movie from start to finish right on the iPad.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.100]   Wait.
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.100]   Wait.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.100]   Does the wait...
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.100]   I'm going to work for you.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:10.100]   A lot of... we were talking a little bit about how is it really comfortable in a lot of the how-to ads that Apple is showing on their website?
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.100]   Would it be really comfortable to sit that way, to work that way?
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   Did you find this to be comfortable in your couch, you know, with your legs crossed and laying back?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   Well, I can't speak for everybody.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   It's going to be a case-by-case basis.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.100]   I was lying on the sofa.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.100]   I had this on my chest.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.100]   It was like maybe I put away from my face.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   It was perfectly fine for me.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.100]   So I didn't really care about that.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.100]   It is a pound and a half.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   It is sort of a large piece of aluminum and glass.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:44.100]   So you are going to probably have to prop it up against something if you're going to be holding it for an hour and a half, especially if you're going to be reading books.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.100]   But the same thing is going to be true of reading an actual hardcover.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:51.100]   And hardcover is way more than a pound and a half and people seem to have gotten by just fine with them.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.100]   Were you able to test?
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.100]   I know that a lot of these updates have just been coming out.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:59.100]   Have you tested the integration of things like Aperture and iPhoto with...
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.100]   the iPad?
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   I have not because I only got my copy of iTunes yesterday.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   Oh, this is, by the way, here's my unboxing video.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   [laughter]
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.100]   Just transcoded apparently.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.100]   So this works pretty much just like the iPhone.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.100]   So you made your video, you put it in, you drop it into iTunes and you just sync it in.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.100]   Exactly.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:32.100]   Some people were asking me earlier, what am I going to need to free up one of my iTunes seats, so to speak.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   If I have only five seats I can use protected content, am I going to have to worry about free up on those seats?
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   It has the same relationship with your desktop as an iPhone does.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   It's just another device that you're syncing to.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.100]   So you can just sync copies to it.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   So home sharing will work just fine.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:49:04.100]   Another bit of minor awesomeness is that books work via home sharing so that if you've got your iPad on your Mac book upstairs
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:10.100]   and you're significant other, it has their own iPad that docks to her iMac downstairs.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:19.100]   You can simply share the books that you've bought with her within the same limitations of the usual home sharing relationship.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.100]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:27.100]   I'm surprised when the media industry does anything that makes sense, but that does make sense that someone in the same house
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.100]   would be able to use the same book.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.100]   There are a lot of interesting solutions to this.
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:43.100]   Sony has been championing a feature of Adobe Digital Editions, which is the ability to sort of donate a bunch of licenses to public libraries,
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   licenses that automatically expire after a couple of weeks.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:55.100]   So you can sign out, so to speak, any book and load it onto your device and know that just you've got a week or ten days to read it because after ten days
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.100]   that license will expire on the device.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.100]   The device will simply not allow that book to be read anymore.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:05.100]   And now that license becomes available again for the next person who wants to download it and use it.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:13.100]   So unfortunately, iBookstore doesn't do anything as cool as that, but I at least appreciate the fact that you can share books with members of your household.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:20.100]   Now do you find between the Kindle and between the iPad, do you find yourself still going back to paper?
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.100]   No, not at all.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   I made almost a complete break from printed books a couple years ago after I got my Kindle 1.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   As a matter of fact, with the Kindle 1, when I first reviewed it, I decided the basis of my review was that, well, it's a cool device.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:48.100]   I think they're really underselling it by just describing it as an e-book reader. I think the really good feature of this device is the simple fact that you get a very, very useful mobile web browser
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   and you get free 3G mobile broadband anywhere in the country and it's free for life.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.100]   They should just sell this as a portable version of Google Reader and then just clean up on that way.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:03.100]   I only started reading e-books on it when I had Mackerel Expo to go to about a month later.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:14.100]   I had only read the first two chapters of a new biography of Harry Houdini and I have to think, oh, God, I'm really going to take this really thick chunk of dead wood
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.100]   with me all the way to California back.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   I'll buy the Kindle book, I'll just read it for the week and then when I get home I'll go back to the regular book.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:28.100]   Those few days of reading the book on the Kindle were all I needed to just to break myself.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   I'm really stopped being scared about the differences between reading stuff on the Kindle versus reading them on paper.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:43.100]   Now my standard MO is that the first time I'm shopping for a book, I'm shopping for the download, I'm not shopping for the paper book anymore.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.100]   I know from the time it's not a paper, that's it.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:52.100]   For me writing was that way where I, there was some kind of break where I just realized it was way more efficient for me to never write on a piece of paper
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.100]   just because I just lose it or whatever.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   It was always, I just really had to find a way to move.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:03.100]   Now one of the things we're getting a lot of requests for is getting an eye full of Twitterific.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.100]   Do you have a?
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.100]   - Twitterific.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.100]   Well, there was one fellow who was very, very mean to me on Twitter.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   - You can now tweet.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   - Is that sound right?
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.100]   - You can now tweet from Twitterific.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.100]   - That's always been a feature of Twitterific.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.100]   I hate to break that.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   - No, but I'm saying you know what you mean right now.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.100]   - Right now you can tweet from the thing you could say.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.100]   - I'm tweeting to you from an iPad.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.100]   - Well, I'll tell you every time you've seen the past week you've seen me tweet from Twitterific.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.100]   I have been tweeting from the iPad because of the seal.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.100]   - Okay, so you didn't have a problem with it.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.100]   You're telling people.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.100]   - Exactly.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:46.100]   There's a lot of things that you tend to, there's a flurry of emails, a flurry of emails between myself and Apple.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:51.100]   Starting the first day saying, okay, so once again, it's okay if I use Twitterific.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.100]   You're not gonna get that out of shape because it'll send some sort of ID.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:03.100]   There was a, first of all, I knew not to send an email from the mail client or at least not to anybody but myself
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   because the email client will stamp the identifier of the application.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:11.100]   The application identifier is sent from iPad, a mail for iPad version 1.0.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.100]   That would have tended to give away the game, wouldn't it have?
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:19.100]   - I'm afraid that just as a joke I said, I did change my stuff on my iPhone.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.100]   - Just have some fun.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.100]   - So Twitterific is not my absolute favorite app.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   It's just a very one-to-one sort of a literal translation from the iPad app.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.100]   It's just so very, very familiar.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   The difference is that it has a mode that's popular in iPad apps that I really like,
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   which is what I call steering wheel mode where if it tilts it on its side,
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.100]   now suddenly it's thinking, the thinking is that you're gonna be holding it like this
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:54.100]   so that you can use one thumb to scroll, the list of content, another thumb to scroll,
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   the list of sources, in this case, bookmarks and trending topics and things like that.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.100]   - Interesting.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:05.100]   - So let me show, actually, while I'm there, let me see, I'm not sure if I can show this to you.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.100]   I meant to talk a little bit about how good the keyboard is.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.100]   The keyboard is really, really good.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:17.100]   I thought that would just be sort of a, well, it's good for typing in URLs maybe
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:23.100]   and very, very short emails, but in fact, let me just write a new one.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:29.100]   In fact, if you compare the size of the on-screen keyboard to the real one,
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:36.100]   it's actually very, very, well, it's not bigger, but the width from Q2P here is,
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:42.100]   I believe, seven inches, the width of Q2P on here is seven and half, seven and three-quarters inches.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.100]   - Right.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.100]   - I find that I can actually touch type very nicely, not with all my fingers,
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.100]   but with my thumb and three fingers.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.100]   - There's also an option.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.100]   - See, that works really well for me because I've never actually learned how to type properly,
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:55:00.100]   so it's perfect for me to be able to just, 'cause I hunt and peck everything with about three fingers.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.100]   - Hang on.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.100]   - So this is, I'm typing from an angle here, so.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.100]   - Right.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.100]   - Please excuse.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.100]   - The typos.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.100]   - Yep.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:16.100]   - How long is the full recharge?
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:22.100]   - The full recharge is pretty quick, four hours on the 10 watt battery,
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.100]   10 watt adapter that comes with the device.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:29.100]   If you want to charge it from USB, just with the USB cable, it'll take about twice as long.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:34.100]   I was a little bit worried that it was going to, that, I was a little bit worried that it was going to be
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:39.100]   something where you take like 10, 20, 30 hours, 'cause this is a pretty serious battery they've got inside here.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:44.100]   - Well, the thing is, and it sounds like, you know, it's, it's, with 10 hours of usage,
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:49.100]   it seems like it's something you can generally use all day, and then at night you plug it in,
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.100]   and you just have to remember to plug it in.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   - Exactly.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.100]   That's really not a problem.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   It has so much battery life that all I wanted out of the battery life was the expectation.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.100]   That I would not have to think about, where am I going to be at two o'clock,
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.100]   and is there going to be a power, is there going to be a power plug near me when I land at 2 p.m.?
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:14.100]   I've, over the past week, I've come to understand that you really have to knock this around pretty badly
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   in order to drain the battery to zero before you're really done for the day.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:23.100]   It was actually almost a little bit frustrating because I'm doing these tests where I need to get from 100% to zero
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:28.100]   and just get that number by still if you keep using it just to keep draining the battery to get usage.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:32.100]   And I'm like, but I don't want to watch this movie.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.100]   I don't want to read Google Rehear.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.100]   You got this.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   - Now, now the, we had another question in the, in the, oh, so can you try doing a Twit.live.Twit.tv?
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   Are you going to view us on the iPad?
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:57.100]   - So, Colleen's in here. She's, she's very interested.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.100]   - Yeah.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:04.100]   I also, I also, part of me wishes that there was possible to get more than nine web pages at going at once.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:11.100]   The, the, this, this page here, which is, when you, when you open a new page, this page, just like this button,
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:16.100]   just like on the iPhone, will take you sort of two. Here's all the pages, thumbnails of all the pages that you've opened.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:20.100]   If there is an open slot, you can tap that and open a new one, but you only get nine slots to that.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   So, let's try to dive.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:30.100]   I am unimpressed with the threats that, because this does not use Flash, you're kind of hosed,
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:35.100]   because I'm finding, oh, there you go, required to be Flash Player watched Twit.live.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.100]   Have we found an alternative that will work on the iPhone?
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:42.100]   - So, Colleen, it just came to that. Do you?
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:47.100]   - Go to, sorry.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:52.100]   Go to live.twit.tv/m.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   - Ooh, like I speak easy. See if you go, in the video stream.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:08.100]   He said, "No, one of the things I use the, I use web, websites for so much is, is for just using a Google Reader.
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:13.100]   And unfortunately, Google Reader has not given us, has not activated an iPad edition.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.100]   When you hit that URL, we'll give you the mobile edition of the iPhone edition.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.100]   It'll be just all stretched to all the hell."
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.100]   So, yes, you're seeing.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   - What do we turn it to the landscape? Will it fill up nicely?
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.100]   - It will explode.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.100]   - Ooh, look at that.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.100]   - We're lucky.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.100]   - What happens if you double tap on the screen?
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   - I'm not your damn monkey.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.100]   - We've got to know.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.100]   - It falls down.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.100]   - It falls down.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.100]   - Okay, so it's taken over.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.100]   So it's playing the video there.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   - Okay, so basically, I know what's happening right now.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   Right now, I'm essentially bug testing.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.100]   It was the first time you've seen it on the live device.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   - We can't help. We can't help it. We had to know.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   - Actually, that's fine.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:03.100]   - Well, you know, I would have asked somebody else, but you're the only one that will return my call that has an iPad.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.100]   That's, you know?
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:09.100]   - Oh, you worked on, well, I was about to say you worked on Star Wars, but you worked on episode one.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.100]   - Oh, oh, bird.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.100]   - Ow.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.100]   - Are you having anything?
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.100]   - I got to grab this thing.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:20.100]   - Let me show you what the MLB.com site looks like.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:27.100]   And I have screenshots of this that will be appearing in Article number three tonight or tomorrow morning.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:32.100]   This is flash content. This is flash content. That's flash content.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.100]   And what do you know?
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:38.100]   It's actually, when you loaded it on the desktop version, when you load it in on an iPad or an iPhone,
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.100]   it simply selects an alternative.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.100]   Gosh, at least it did last time.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.100]   I have a screen shot.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   I've clicked a flash turned on on my desktop.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:53.100]   And so you see all the holes where all this content should have been.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.100]   But it seems to have been filling in quite nicely.
[00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:00.100]   - Now, is it HTML5? It works fine?
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.100]   - Works just fine.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.100]   I think that should be something there. I don't know where it is.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.100]   It was, the problem with you is working just fine the other day here, as a matter of fact.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:16.100]   - Now, can you drag more things onto that? Is there still four items on the dock at the bottom?
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:23.100]   - Yes. But you can add more stuff to it. So if I wanted the Marvel Comics app, I used to do it the same way I would do on the iPhone.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.100]   - Okay.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.100]   - Just grab it, move it like that. I believe the maximum is five.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.100]   So, let me just, there you go. There's our six rather.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.100]   - Look at that.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:38.100]   - Yeah. But now imagine how good the Sketchbook app is going to be. This is the Autodesk app.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.100]   As you can see, I've been doing lots of serious artwork here.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.100]   - I really like what you've done there.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.100]   - Yes.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:48.100]   - A little bit of, I see a Starbucks logo, the old Starbucks logo kind of hidden.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.100]   - It was an experiment that didn't really work.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:01:00.100]   - So how is the, is it touch sensitive, like how pushing harder, lighter, or is it just pretty much warmer?
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.100]   - It's not multi, excuse me.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.100]   - It's a pressure sensitive.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:11.100]   - Okay. And what about the, and what about the, wow, the resolution looks great.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:20.100]   - It's guessing.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:25.100]   - That looks gorgeous.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:34.100]   - Well, I did go to art class for almost an entire summer during summer camp.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.100]   - Now, is there any other apps that really stood out for you?
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.100]   - Unfortunately, there's just a limited number of apps that are available to me.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:49.100]   I was pretty, I think that you can see why Apple chose, most of the apps that they chose for this demo,
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:55.100]   because these are all apps that work exceptionally well.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:02.100]   And also Apple, they also show off that developers that seem to really get what a, an iPad app should look like.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:07.100]   Through the iPad emulator, some developers over the past month, month and a half,
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.100]   have been sending me builds of stuff that they're working on.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:15.100]   And you can sort of see where they're like, oh, dudes, you haven't really broken away from the keyboard of the mouse yet.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:24.100]   You're still thinking in terms of a drop down menu instead of something that should really be attached to that picture that you've just added that you wanted then modify.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.100]   They haven't really locked it yet.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:33.100]   So I really think that the starters pistol on the iPad is going to really begin about four or five months from now,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:39.100]   because right now all the apps with very few exceptions that are going to be available for the store on Saturday,
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.100]   we're developed without the privilege of seeing them run on a real live iPad.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:52.100]   So I think that in two or three months when all these developers have received their iPads and now they're just furiously coding and recoding and doing real, real testing,
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.100]   that's when you're going to see like the really great apps start to arrive.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:03:03.100]   Now, what's your opinion of the current, like, did you try putting some that are already iPhone apps that just simply get pixel doubled up?
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.100]   Were they usable? Was it worth it?
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:14.100]   It really depends. This is a pixel. You won't be able to really see it on streaming, but it is just pixel doubled.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.100]   They haven't done anything really special.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.100]   I thought that they might have only been going to use something, some technique to smooth it out a little bit,
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.100]   or maybe they're going to be smart enough to know that, gee, the type of the label of this button is supposed to be a bit of text.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.100]   We know what that text is.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:33.100]   So instead of just doubling those pixels will actually render that text of the proper resolution, but no, it's just pixel doubled.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:39.100]   Now, if you bought an iPhone app or if you bought apps for your iPhone, are you going to be able to use those apps,
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   all that money that you invested on your iPhone on your iPad as well?
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:50.100]   So they're all linked to your iTunes account so that when you put in the preference,
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:56.100]   we've defined your preferences inside this device as, "Hi, my ID is this. Here's my password."
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:05.100]   Then every single bit of content that that ID is allowed to access and play will also be accessed and played by the iPad.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:10.100]   Right. Now, did you get any of the other accessories with this?
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.100]   I got many of the most of the accessories that are available right now.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.100]   I did get the keyboard dock. I got the table dock.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]   How about the camera connector?
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:22.100]   The camera connector is not available right now and won't be shipping for another few weeks.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:28.100]   Interesting stuff about that. It seems to have a bunch of slick interfaces to it.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:37.100]   The Photos app on the iPad has the same functionality as image capture does on your desktop,
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:46.100]   meaning that once you attach the camera to it, a special feature sort of pops up and shows you thumbnails of all the different photos that are on that device,
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.100]   allowing you to slurp in just the ones that you want.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   When you're done importing them, then you can just simply bag the entire card or just have it ejected.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.100]   It will support JPEG or RAW, which is win number one.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:05.100]   Win number two is that these images are simply, by the way, I'm sorry, it also will import video as well.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.100]   So you'll be able to play video that you've shot on these devices right on.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.100]   Are there any issues around compatibility on those devices?
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.100]   I mean, just really all the major formats. There's a lot of them.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.100]   I mean, there's AVI and MP4 and M4V and H.264.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.100]   Do you know if they're really supporting all of them?
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:30.100]   Only time will tell. I don't have my hands on the actual thing yet, so I can't really test it out.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   I'm just told that a variety of... It uses the same sort of toolkit on the iPad as it does on the desktop,
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:45.100]   so you would assume or I would assume that any RAW format that's supported by an iPhone will also be supported by this device.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:51.100]   Now, a lot of people are trying to decide whether they should get a 16, a 32, a 64.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.100]   Do you see this as a transient device that you only need to put a couple things on it,
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   or should people really go for as much memory as they can pack into this thing?
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   I honestly and truly believe that you're going to want to have the 64 gigabyte model.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   I absolutely believe that because... Now that I actually had one, the first thing I'm doing is taking a look at the file sizes of everything that's being transacted.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:26.100]   When you're a 16 gigabyte device is going to be perfectly usable, but when you consider that the movie that you downloaded for a 24-hour rental is taking up a gigabyte,
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   when the comic book you just downloaded takes up 150 megabytes, you're quickly going to run into the ceiling.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:40.100]   You're quickly going to run into a problem where you have to start sacrificing things that you need for things that you want and vice versa.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:47.100]   I think that this device truly, truly shines when you have the ability to just use it for everything.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   Just have the modus operandi where I have a document, I have a file, I have a piece of media.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   It is in some way even remotely useful to me.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:03.100]   By default, I'm going to put it on the iPad because it's going to be a situation which I didn't think that I was going to need the 68 page government report,
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.100]   but it seemed to be the sort of thing that I'm sort of into.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:14.100]   It turns out that I actually needed to have this in the field or was a very, very good thing that I had this whole rule book with me or had this entire old report from three months ago with me.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.100]   That's when the iPad will really earn its spurs for all its owners.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:23.100]   Now, does it come with a... There's been talk that Apple was going to try to do some of their own mapping.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:29.100]   Does this come with just basically Google Maps or is it something new, something different, anything?
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:35.100]   It's just Google Maps, and that's it. A really, really cool version of Google Maps, I think.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:43.100]   This is the Wi-Fi version, so location services doesn't work quite as good as it does.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:55.100]   There we go. I've got a map of... I need to go to New York tomorrow, you see, and the rain just shut down all Amtrak service, like that's north of Rhode Island.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   I have to figure out if I can drive to a later station because I need to be in New York tomorrow.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:11.100]   Tomorrow night, there's a possibility that there's going to be an iPad top 10 list, and I'm going to be providing something interesting for me to make that.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   It's like, "Oh, life is so hard sometimes."
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   See, this is an demonstration of how fluid the scrolling is.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:28.100]   I wish that the frame rate of this was fast enough to keep up, but you almost feel a bond villain that you're just navigating.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:38.100]   You're just flying over this area so quickly, let's zoom in, it quickly comes in, and within a few seconds, it just re-updates itself, unless you've zoomed in too tightly.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:49.100]   There are a couple of graphic flourishes, like this page curl, you tap that, and the page lifts up to show you what the settings are for this app.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   I'm just told to turn on the terrain and now it just quickly re-dross itself.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:58.100]   It is just demonically fast, the way that it swirls through and makes decisions like that.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.100]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:05.100]   I did think it was interesting that it gives you the search box for Safari.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:15.100]   It does give you the option, it's Google by default, but it has one option, and that option is Yahoo, which is, "Dudes, you have to use the Internet three years, have you?"
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.100]   I think we're going to see a Bing search pretty quickly.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.100]   Right.
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:26.100]   Now, last question, and I know you have to get up, and I think we're saturated.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.100]   Speaker quality, when you're sitting there watching it, do you have to have your headphones in?
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.100]   Do you feel like you can just listen to the speakers?
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.100]   The speakers were another huge and wonderful surprise.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:44.100]   You see this tiny, tiny little port on the bottom of it, and honest to God, I was over the past couple of weeks.
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.100]   I'm like, "Okay, things I need to have on hand for the iPad test.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   I need to have a pair of Bluetooth, A2DP speakers, so that I can see what the sound will look like."
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:57.100]   A decent sound will finally sound like a little bit over the travel speakers, but man alive.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:10.100]   They must be using the airspace behind this as a resonator or something, because you're actually getting highs, you're getting bass, you can feel it vibrating through your fingertips when you're holding it and watching a movie.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   I actually thought, it was such a good quality sound, that I actually had to play to a side-by-side comparison just for my own edification between the iPad and my MacBook,
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   because the sound was that good and that clear.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:34.100]   And after a couple side-by-sides, I had to give the win to the MacBook, but the fact that it was good enough that I would even consider that just shows you how good the quality is.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:40.100]   I did watch the entire 90-minute movie of up without feelings of suffering at all.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:47.100]   It's a very, very wide, it's a very, very slick and very, very wide dynamic range.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.100]   There was never any clipping, never any buzzing.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.100]   I was really blown away by how good it was.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:59.100]   I was expecting nothing, and nonetheless, it was just a solid win.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:05.100]   One more question, a lot of people are worried about, this is the first version, is it going to be stable?
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.100]   Should I wait for the next version to come out?
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.100]   Is this something that's really worth diving into?
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.100]   From your perspective?
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:17.100]   I think that there's another thing that I cover in one of those pieces.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:24.100]   I think that there is a special kind of user that can use this right now.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:29.100]   People like me who need to have some sort of a computer with them pretty much at all times,
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.100]   anytime I'm outside the office for more than an hour or two, it's really important that I have a computer
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   so that I can file stories or edit stuff that's come back to me or just keep on top of things.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:48.100]   People who live an aggressively digital life where all of their entertainment and their media is going to be digital to begin with,
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.100]   so you have a lot of different content that you can put on this right away.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   If you go into the Apple store and you try it out and you don't even need to look at a third party app to realize that,
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:03.100]   "My God, this will change my life in a really organically great way," then maybe this is for you right now.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:07.100]   Otherwise, you might want to wait a few months just to see what new apps come out for.
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:14.100]   I think this is going to be a completely different device in a few months when the full range of its abilities is exploited by the app store.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:19.100]   I don't think there's a, if you need one right now, I don't think there's a particular reason to wait an entire year for it.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:27.100]   Obviously, this is just 1.0 of a device that if this version is any indication, it has a long, long life ahead of it.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.100]   But it's the standard conundrum.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:35.100]   If you keep on waiting for the next great thing to come by, you'll be always waiting for the next great thing.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:43.100]   Andy Naco from the Chicago Sun Times, thank you so much for giving us a sneak preview.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.100]   There he is.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   There's Andy.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.100]   He's snuck by there.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.100]   So again, this is the iPad revealed.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:58.100]   I think probably one of the first videos on the web anywhere, giving people kind of a preview outside of Apple, of course.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:04.100]   So I want to thank everyone also who came and tuned in and gave us great questions and gave us some guidance on where we should go with this.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.100]   And again, Andy, thanks.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.100]   Thank you so much.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.100]   Hey, it's Ben Slice.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.100]   If you want to see that unboxing video for real, go to my YouTube account.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.100]   I'm Anakko.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.100]   I-H-N is a Nancy.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.100]   A-T is in Tom.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   While we were having some fun here, it's been uploaded.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.100]   I've just un-checked the box to make it public, so you should be able to see it.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.100]   Fantastic.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.100]   And once again, check out SunTimes.com because we already got two or three pieces up.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.100]   There are a couple more that are in the hopper that are going to be drifting in.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.100]   So by tomorrow morning, I believe the entire package will be open available.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.100]   Great.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.100]   It's been a slice.
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.100]   And everyone else, this break time is over.
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.100]   Back to dinner.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.100]   [LAUGHTER]
