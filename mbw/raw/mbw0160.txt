[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, on the ukulele, Mr. Andy Ennato from the

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   How are you?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I am doing fine, Leo.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I am the rest of the all-milkman orchestra, boys.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It looks like they've gone out to take a coffee break.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Also here, we hear a distaff laugh that would be the wonderful
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org, founder of Life Packard,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and a regular on This Week in Google, our Google show every Saturday.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Greetings.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Also in the environs, the newly barbered Merlin Mann.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hello, Joe.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   With his nose horn.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Good to talk to you all.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We're going to give a break to Alex Lindsey, who is a consuming
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   beef in Brazil, and start talking about the Macintosh with you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's good to have you all.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Any big Mac news that I missed out?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Let me just check quickly and see anything happen in the Mac world.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Actually, I'll go through this.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The island, Dennis at the island sent this to me.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   The top 10 new details on the Apple tablet.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Gina said, "I'm going to do this show, but I've got to tell you,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I just mock all these stories."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So mock away, Gina.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, so what?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's a giant iPhone.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm also the only non-iPhone owner on the panel.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I do have an iPod touch.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Are you going to give up Android now, though, after the cyanogen
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   thing?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It looks like they came to resolution on that, actually.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, he's going to continue to make it wrong.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You're going to create a green file in this season, desist letter?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Was that the reason?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That was the resolution.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Sure, boss.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He basically figured out a workaround.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Oh, good.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   They decided to compromise.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   He will cease, but he will not desist.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Everyone goes from half way there.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So here is the story.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   According to Jeremy Horowitz writing for iPod Lounge, number one,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Apple has created at least three separate prototypes of this tablet computer.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Version one had a seven inch screen deemed too small.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Are you stretching exercises?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm getting too deep.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   No, I don't want to miss a bit of this.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You really care.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Okay.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You just got me.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   1130 AM Pacific, and there's a lot of things that are going to change based on what I hear about the Apple
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   PC in the next few minutes.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   In the next few minutes.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I want to listen very carefully.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Listen very carefully.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Make a lot of decisions differently, knowing what somebody's guessing is happening with
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.560]   a tablet that may not come out and information that may or may not be true, a lot of things
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   are going to change for me.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   So I'm taking notes.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.000]   I'm just going to take this story.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   This is going to just take that right out of the book.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's a bad news on that story.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It's where we're done.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   No, no, come on.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Leo, people care about this stuff.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   They're excited about it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No, no.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I don't follow this.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I think it's ridiculous.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.960]   But what out there do people really know?
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   Nothing.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   Zero zip zilch.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.760]   One thing that there has been a large order placed for 10.7 inch screens, touch screens.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.760]   That's all we know.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.640]   And Mr. Verizon said we will have something to sell on the Verizon network next year,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.080]   early next year.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.520]   But otherwise you're right.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   This is all rank speculation.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.280]   I don't mean to be the term in the punch ball.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   I don't want it.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   That was unkind of me.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   I apologize.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.600]   That's a completely appropriate response, I think.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.680]   I just don't understand how are people still talking about what is there to discuss?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.680]   There's nothing.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.840]   No, no, no, it's anything.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.000]   What is what is there to discuss?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   All right.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.120]   I'll tell you something we do know.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.320]   Apple opened up the iPhone in the UK.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.160]   Now Vodafone has it.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   O2 was O2 that had it.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   Orange had it.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   Now it's O2, orange and Vodafone.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   Why, that's exciting.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   How many hours?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   I see.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   Andy, you're not going to help me at all.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   Are you just going to see?
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   I'm going to see.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   How many people is there?
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   It's interesting that it looks like China is getting another step closer to getting the
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.320]   iPhone.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.160]   Mostly it's all about making sure that you can't get Wi-Fi on it because the government
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   does not trust Wi-Fi.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.720]   Oh, is that true?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.400]   They don't allow Wi-Fi in China?
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.880]   It's not that they don't allow it.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000]   They don't particularly like it or trust it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.680]   When I was in Beijing, one of our listeners who's an IT worker, I was kind enough to talk
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.120]   to me a lot about what it's like to try to create digital resources and digital services
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520]   in China.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.920]   He failed to properly explain it to me as well.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.960]   I'm sure it's because it's one of those things where you have to talk to a lot of people
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.160]   at the government and nobody at the government really understands.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.240]   It's just part of the culture of that particular ministry that we don't like Wi-Fi because
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   it's very, very hard for us to control, very, very hard for us to selectively turn things
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   off.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.840]   Meanwhile, this is the same ministry that was shutting down access to, excuse me, was having
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.920]   providers shut down access to Twitter and Flickr and Facebook while I was there, but had
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.240]   no problems with me accessing all those services via my iPhone.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.320]   Because they didn't know yet, the next time we're there, I bet the iPhone won't work quite
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   so well.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.280]   It's, it's, it's, no, no, we get into a lot of how the power that the government has to
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   shut things down.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.600]   Again, it was explained to me that it's more like the power that the FCC has to make sure
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   we don't see any boobies or f-words during the end.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   They don't have a big master switch that turns things off.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.760]   They simply contact the companies that they've licensed to have access to that big pipe of
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.440]   digital and say, you know what, we would really, really appreciate it.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.680]   If you would turn off the following services and close the following ports, if you don't
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.360]   know, well, maybe that might affect your ability to do business in the, in the digital domain
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.280]   within the worker's paradise.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.320]   It also becomes, doesn't know, on some level it becomes like decimation, like, you know,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   in Rome.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.120]   The true meaning of decimation is they go and they kill one of every 10 people and they
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.400]   had enough of a chilling effect that people would say, I don't want to be the next one
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   of those 10.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   One is that.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.200]   And then at a certain point, I don't know, you hear these stories about stuff happening
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.560]   in China, like people being, you know, pulled out of cafes while they're typing and stuff.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.160]   I don't know if that's true, but the chilling effects of that must be substantial enough
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.560]   of the people who are going to live there for the rest of their life must self edit because
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   why bring yourself back troubles?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   What do you think, Danny?
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.200]   Did you, was it, was that your impression?
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.280]   Well, the thing is my impression is that in China, and this is, and this is the experience
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   of an American tourist who spent all of five days there.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Let's preface that.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.000]   The impression I get is that you will have every freedom that you could possibly ask
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   for if it is the freedom to enhance the economy of the people's republic.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   It is amazing.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.240]   You turn on like nine channels of state run television and you're amazed that it is so
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.760]   much like Western TV.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.280]   There is maybe one channel that fits into the stereotype you have in your mind of what
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.600]   a totally government run means of communication between the government and the people would
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.200]   be like.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.480]   I don't think that the other sense that I get is that it's more of a, it's more of
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.360]   a cultural thing about what is in China.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.440]   What is the definition of the role of the individual person?
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.800]   What is the responsibility of the individual person?
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.400]   What is the responsibility of the government and how do those two connect with each other?
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.680]   Over here, what is sacrosanct for good and for bad is that I am an individual person.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   I have rights.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.480]   Nothing can possibly trample those rights.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.200]   And if you're going to be putting limitations on those rights, we need to have a long discussion.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.640]   Not that it can't happen, but the assumption is going to be that I need to have the ability
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   to do whatever I want.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.320]   It's not just something that comes from force of law.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.040]   It comes from the force of my growing up here and always understanding it that way.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.840]   And my parents, my grandparents and their parents understanding that that was the deal.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.160]   In China, and this is something that was also sort of explained to me, talking to several
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.940]   people who've been living there for many, many, many years, it's more like the responsibility
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.840]   is not to the individual, but to the larger society.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.640]   As a matter of fact, one of the expats was trying to explain why he thinks they shut
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.600]   down Twitter and Flickr and the rest.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.400]   It wasn't so much that, well, there's been this 200 people were killed in ethnic violence.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.240]   And when the provinces, we can't let this information get out.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.880]   It was more because the reason why this ethnic violence happened was because there was a
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.120]   small piece of violence, rumors spread that it's not, rumors spread that it was the Muslims
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.600]   that killed it, that committed this atrocity.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   Let's start killing Muslims.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.080]   The Muslims started hearing about this saying, well, let's kill the people who are killing
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   us.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.120]   And again, this one individual was telling me probably the idea of the government was
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.760]   that the reason why all this stuff is happening is that all these wild stupid rumors are spreading.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.920]   Let's shut down some of the means by which some irresponsible stuff is being exchanged
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.440]   between the people who are involved in this and that'll help to reduce the temperature
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.960]   of this situation.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.360]   So it's way more complicated than, again, a five day tourist can possibly get into.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.920]   But it's fascinating that, again, living in the United States for so long, your imagination
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.120]   is that there was someone in a drab coat with a red star somewhere on the lapel watching
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.120]   over anything and everything being prepared to slam the door on any individuality or any
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.600]   execution of freedom.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.800]   When it's actually, well, it's part, you have to go back about a thousand years to understand
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.680]   the roots of why this is how this society is, how it is.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.560]   It's probably the same reason why people are befuddled by guys, Americans, why do you
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040]   think you need to have guns?
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.560]   Well, it's not that we need to have guns is that we if we want a gun, we should be able
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   to get it.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.640]   And that's the philosophy that that keeps the gun lobby moving.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.240]   So it's again more complicated than someone five days of experience can talk about, but
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   interesting nonetheless.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.480]   Here's some security.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.280]   FUD from CNN.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.320]   I love I love the way that nine to five Mac discuss this.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.440]   And I kind of thought it was FUD to I saw this story was everywhere.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:27.080]   The computer world had it that Russian hackers are offering 43 cents per Mac as a reward to
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.960]   hackers subverting security on the platform.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.920]   Of course, everybody jumped on this because people have just been dying waiting for that
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.880]   story about how hackable the Mac is on, you know, if you really look deeply into it, it
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.920]   turns out it was a six page security research document that had one paragraph that said
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.400]   Mac users are not immune to the scare where threat.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:53.080]   In fact, there are codec partner, dedicated as I guess it's a Russian term dedicated
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.920]   to sale and promotion of fake Mac software.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.800]   One of the recent examples is Mac dash codec.com.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.480]   A few months ago was offering 43 cents for each install and various promo materials in
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.160]   the form of Mac OS video players, a site is now down.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.640]   There's no evidence at all.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.960]   I mean, I could offer $50 per Mac computer.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   Okay, there you go.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   Well, okay.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.360]   Hacker offers now it's out there, you know, productivity.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   How many they get?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   Hacker offers $50 per computer.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   Yeah, that's the story.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   How many they get?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   None.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   They went out of business.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.880]   It didn't work.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.000]   But we're certainly not immune.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.160]   I mean, my gosh, I think if anything on a Mac, we talked about this a hundred times on
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   here, but you know, you get so accustomed.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   It's sort of like when, uh, when Vista came out and it was going to have all these extra
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.000]   layers and Gina can speak to this more than I can, but when Vista came out and there was
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.840]   this, oh, now you're going to have to click through and click through and click through.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.480]   And I know now, I mean, I'll be revealing about myself here when I'm installing something
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.120]   off a DMG, particularly if it's from a known place.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.000]   I mean, I almost know exactly where on the screen I have to click to go, yes, I read
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.040]   the agreement and it might say like you're going to send us your testicles by overnight
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.440]   mail and I wouldn't know that just install it.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.000]   And so I, you know, I, I think any of that with a Mac, especially if you're the admin,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I mean, you know, but you're, but you're initial.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But you're initial.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.840]   Any of that your initial point is well taken, which is that there's still no exploits that
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   we know of in the wild.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   Andy, have you seen any explicit?
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.120]   I haven't seen any explicit.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.360]   Nothing that was outside of a lab condition, though.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.200]   But I mean, you could, you couldn't do something where you could basically.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.280]   You could kind of call them something.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.400]   Some kind of RMR thing that would just like run, I mean, Gina would know this better
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.680]   than I could, but like in something like a frame, I mean, yeah, there's kind of be
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.080]   a million ways to get somebody, what, I mean, once you enter your admin password, it's
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.160]   game over.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.960]   Everything's an exploit to enter your admin password.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.680]   And I think that I think we kind of cocky about that and think, oh, well, there's all
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.200]   these idiots using Windows.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.960]   You don't have the sense to go spend a little more on a Mac and be perfect.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.360]   And it's like, you know, it just depends on what you're doing, what you're seeing, what
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.320]   your experience is not indicated right now.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.520]   However, neither is the fud that the mainstream media spread saying, Oh, look, somebody's offering
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   money for a max.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.760]   It's a good article.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   But like I say, I mean, anybody can offer anything.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.720]   It's, you know, it's, it's a, it's a data pointed in, in a case that someone has an interest
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.040]   in promoting this sort of malware.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   So I don't think it should be necessarily dismissed.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.560]   I mean, it's not necessarily fun.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.400]   It's might be an interesting data point.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.280]   There is a malware scanner that runs in snow leopard.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.440]   I haven't seen it.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.520]   I guess it's just kind of does its thing.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.640]   But when you try to open up download it, what would that look for?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.840]   Well, that's looking for some kind of checksum.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   That's your answer.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.440]   Well, well, it's, it's, it's doing, it's doing a checksum.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.120]   It's basically looking for a signature.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.680]   This main purpose isn't so much to protect the Mac so much as to prevent your Mac from
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   being a way station for Windows viruses and stuff like that.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   That's, that's funny.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.280]   It's, it's so far that's my understanding.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   That's been the market for any viruses on the Mac is to protect your Windows friends just
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.920]   in case.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   Keep from spreading it.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   There's a, but you know what?
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   It's funny.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.640]   It is, it is funny, but it's funny in the other way too.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.680]   Something I think about a lot is in trying to be good with password hygiene and being careful
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   about what you do.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.920]   I mean, you know, obviously nobody's perfect with this stuff, but I was thinking the other
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.880]   day about how, you know, in the same way that your virus protection or your malware protection
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.160]   is going to be as good as the weakest link is funny.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.720]   Think about the number of people you correspond with where your email security is as good as
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   their password in a lot of ways.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.600]   I don't think people think about that a lot.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.920]   If you've ever thought about that, like you, you change your password all the time or whatever,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.480]   but somebody who's been has seven years of email from you, if they put in pencil as their
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.040]   password, they got your email that way as well.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   That's a good point.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.560]   Yeah, emails, you know, it's like sent in a postcard.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.800]   And once, once an email goes out, it's never got, you never got, you never got a clear
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.560]   text password and email.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.600]   Oh, definitely.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   And that's, that's a huge, that's a huge problem.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.560]   And that's actually, yeah, a big debate for sure.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.240]   I send passwords all the time.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   People will say, what's the password to the FTP server?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.640]   And I'll send it out because I don't have any other way to, to do it.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   I mean, you know,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.840]   Things but email though that is funny is that, you know, now that everything kind of touches
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.880]   email, there's an extraordinary amount of information that gets pushed around in there.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   I guess I'm sorry.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   That was kind of a red herring.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.800]   You know, you're writing, like you wouldn't receive my password.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.320]   But at the same time, it is kind of funny as we get more comfortable with things like
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.200]   cloud computing and stuff like that.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.000]   You know, I think that I don't think there's room for anybody to be cocky here to quote
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.320]   Robert De Niro and Brazil, which we truly are all in this together.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.000]   And I think, you know, having some kind of pointless, you know, kind of shallow.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.600]   Was he the first to say that in Brazil?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   That's interesting.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.280]   Well, no, remember he comes up and he fixes the guy's ducks?
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.640]   Is that right Andy checking on that?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   Isn't that scenario?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   Yeah, it's the name.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   It's the plot.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   It's a bottle of tuddle.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   Bottle of tuddle, bottle of tuddle, bottle.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   Unimportant.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.140]   But I do think we are truly all in this together.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.360]   And I mean, you know, there's a phenomenon that you see where people like the first time
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.080]   somebody on your block gets their house broken into, it isn't like people run over and say,
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   gosh, I'm really sorry.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   Is there anything I can do?
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.320]   They start doing a mental inventory of all the ways in which they're better than the person
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.360]   who got broken into because they take precautions in the other person's in 80.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   And I don't know.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   I'd agree with you though.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.440]   I think any kind of foot around that stuff.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.320]   Again, I'm going to consider the source.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.320]   Sorry CNN.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.360]   They're looking for page views.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.720]   They're not looking to help people make better decisions about security.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.520]   They're looking to make you go.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.800]   I just feel like and maybe it's just me as a Mac user is a little meaner, meaner, meaner
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   to them.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.960]   Well, we've realized you got some meaner coming.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   Don't you think a little bit?
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.120]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.720]   Does everybody hate Mac users?
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   I hate Mac users.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   I do.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.320]   I'm exactly the sort of person that I keep fighting against.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   I hate myself.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.600]   I'm easily the most self-loathing gentile of all time.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.560]   I mean, I think that the important thing to remember is that no platform is immune to
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.880]   user stupidity, right?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.640]   I mean, and that's what most malware has to do with is somebody clicking a link they
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.640]   shouldn't click.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.960]   And there were some iChat worms or whatever that were going out or people were clicking
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   on.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.200]   And I mean, cross scripting vulnerabilities, I'm sure happen in Safari.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   They have to have.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.800]   Safari doesn't have quite the market share.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.120]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.200]   I can't say I've never done any serious hacking on the Mac platform, but it's hard for me
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.680]   to think that any platform is like, is no platform is totally foolproof and doesn't
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   have to hold.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.080]   Well, but in the minute, Nick says this in his book.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.720]   He's like, you know, I'm a hacker, but you know, the best way to get the password to
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]   the whole company is call the CEO and say you're from IT.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   Social engineering is not just saying, oh, this guy's an idiot.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.040]   It's a way of saying it's almost like being maybe not a magician and illusionist, right?
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.280]   It's like, it's kind of like social sleight of hand where there's all kinds of information
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   you can get people to give about themselves.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   I need a clipboard.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.440]   Show up with a clipboard and you look important.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.200]   And maybe one of those key chains that goes, you know, has the chain that goes, yeah, because
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   only an IT person would carry that and a leather man, leather man helps.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.360]   If you open up the conversation with, tell me, what does the gentle touch of a woman
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   feel like?
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.760]   And you go, sir, or.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.000]   It's like a chain password.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Clearly you're here.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   You're on the up and up.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   But you know what?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It is kind of weird though.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.760]   The other part of this, though, and I mean, again, I'm not, this is not a bag and a windows
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.360]   thing, but it's amazing how often I encounter people like, you know, you always see this
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.480]   through your relatives, you know, where I, at one point, my, my, my sister-in-law was
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.440]   ready to just go put her computer on the curb.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.760]   She's like, I don't understand.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.840]   I don't understand what happened.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   Like it's just, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.200]   And I went and got, I forget what it was.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   This is like three or four years ago.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.280]   I went and got, I knew more about Windows at that time and I went and got or whatever
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.600]   the, the free malware program everybody used at the time was.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.320]   And, you know, I let it run for like three or four hours.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   And it was extraordinary.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.480]   It was blind-
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.720]   Oh, the thousands of bugs on there.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.560]   And again, that's not, that's like not a slam against a human being.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.480]   It's just a reality that one of those things out in the wild is such an attractive nuisance.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.600]   And I mean, I don't know what you, I don't know what you do to fix that, but you know,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.240]   like having a swimming pool that's, you'd never clean and then you take the.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.720]   Yeah, or don't put a fence around.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.520]   I mean, for somebody to come in and go, oh, you got six kids, let me give you a pool.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.600]   But like, you got to go figure out that there's a fence that you should get.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.320]   We've got an analogy.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.800]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   I like it.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.840]   It really helps me at least understand the depths of this.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.200]   Actually Apple put out a pretty big security release last week with dozens of fixes, many
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.560]   of them to open source programs on the OS 10.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.440]   You guys, I just got curiosity on the last point.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.560]   I'm just curious because I suspect this is going to be true for Gina.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:29.200]   I subscribe to sometime a long time ago, I subscribe to a service that does like, okay,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   tell me if the terror alert changes.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   Tell me about that at a time.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   It's like, you tell the kind of stuff you.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   Has it changed by the way?
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.960]   I think it's the same.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.200]   I think it's still good in orange.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   Yeah, it's orange.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   It's extremely likely every day.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   So anyway, be careful.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   Orange useful information.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.280]   I had a little, I did a, there was a gadget that was like a lamp that would glow and it
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.320]   would glow the color of the security alert.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.840]   I can't imagine they sold many because just sat there was orange.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   Unflattering.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   It's like fluttering light.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   You know that orange.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   Come on, are you going to go red?
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   You're going to go green?
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.640]   Is that the lamp that just turned red or is that just like the hell fire raining down
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   from above that's coloring the entire magic?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.280]   Oh, that doesn't really matter.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   Either either.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.680]   But I get updates on some of the open source software that I have installed in various places
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.520]   and I'll see like, you know, security updates and I get four or five a day on cross site
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.400]   scripting is a big one inside things like Drupal and things like that.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.720]   But I mean, you know, there's a, people, this is not a Mac thing, but I think it's worth
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.400]   mentioning in the context of Mac security is that software is just software.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.840]   It's not magic.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.000]   Software is a, is telling a machine how to do something and machines are not smart and
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.880]   people are kind of smart, but the machines always write, you know, it's, it's we that
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.960]   are wrong and the programs that we make are imperfect and things change.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.520]   And like you said, Leo, it's your point just now.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.680]   I mean, there's a lot of OSS under the hood with Mac or GPL or whatever it is.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   And, you know, a lot, you know, thank God, a lot of that stuff is just crazy secure because
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.080]   there's so many eyes on it all the time.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   But nobody's ever completely current or completely safe ever.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   And that's just, you know, that's how it is.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   Yep.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.160]   Anyway, karma suck.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.720]   I know you're a Sloan fan, but do you like Rush?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.160]   They're from Canada too.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   I'm very serious.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   Duh.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   Okay.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   I've seen that.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   No, no, I'm saying like I love Rush.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.160]   Okay.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.280]   I'm just checking because today Apple expanded the lessons finally in the garage band lessons
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.840]   store to include two classic Rush songs and a John Legend song.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.680]   Rush guitarist Alex Lifson takes you through the intro riff to Tom Sawyer.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.640]   And after learning the opening riff, then Lifson breaks down the riffs of the rest of
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.920]   the song showing their chords and solo techniques and then limelight.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.040]   Yeah, it's just an E and an A. Okay.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   It's a beginner lesson.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.880]   Hey, I'm saying Lio Laport.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.960]   I just say I can't even play Tom Sawyer on rock.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.480]   I just like breaking into tears.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   It's so hard to play.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.120]   Do the garage band lessons just suck all the rock and roll out of the songs for you, Marlon,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.920]   or I'm not into music, but does that just make just just kill you?
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.040]   I watched a couple of them.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.560]   It's got that cute girl of place piano.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   I watched that one a couple of times.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   It's a lot of like, "Hi, I'm Will Johnson and I'm a guitarist.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.160]   It plays things you've never heard."
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.920]   I had such proper potential though.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.920]   I didn't need idea.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   Yeah, I loved the idea.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   It's one of those things.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   It's one of those things.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   It's like when NPR does tech reports and it's like depending on your point of view,
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.360]   it's either going to be totally over your head or completely condescending.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.240]   I feel like that with the rock band lessons where it's like, that's not the place that
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.480]   I would go to learn how to play guitar personally.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.080]   I mean, me, I would buy fake books and try to learn chords and stuff.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.800]   Do you know much about the sales of that?
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   It's such an innovative channel and I'm sure artists would love.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.720]   I'm checking on it right now because I just don't think that they had very many choices
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.360]   on there.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.880]   The only way to make that really work is to make sure that you develop a lesson community
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.680]   where you have official ones that you have to pay for that you know has a certain amount
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.760]   of authority behind it, but also let people, the folks who do these really great videos
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.720]   on YouTube about how to get the fingering right for let it be or whatever, they should
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.800]   be able to contribute or at least a link between that library and a free library because
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.920]   as it is, it seems as though you're trying to sell really professional services to probably
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.160]   people who already know how to play that technique.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.720]   They need to get the absolute introduction introductory lessons or they need to figure
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.880]   out who's going to be paying a lot of money to master these.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.440]   But I believe the kids would refer to as a mad skill.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.640]   I never played anything with more than four strings on it, so I'm definitely not.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.600]   I'm not even slightly irked in terms of my terms.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.760]   I wish to have been fold one for brick if memory serves.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   Was it good?
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.200]   I can't play piano, but I like him.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.280]   They have basic lessons, but then they have these celebrity lessons.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   It looks like the only thing.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.880]   Andy's is so interesting to me.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.400]   My gosh, think about the way I teens were.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   18 celebrity lessons, that's all.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   So there's not a huge number.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's a nice idea, but they need to really pursue it aggressively.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Well, I've just bought the Tom Sawyer because if I can make Merlin cry, I will.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I can play.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.320]   There was a point where I could do the pull offs at the beginning of Spirit of Radio,
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.400]   but I wouldn't need to try that right now.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.200]   I think they might be missing a little bit of a trick because the hallmark of the way people
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.560]   enjoy music in 2008 and 2009 is that it's fun to watch people who are really good at
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.240]   something and do that thing that they're so good at doing.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   I agree.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   And I would love to.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.640]   If you get the artist saying, here's how I do the solo on this particular song that
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.120]   you've all heard and you've sort of been blown away by.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.300]   Not that I necessarily want to learn how to do it, but I want to learn what's inside his
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.040]   head, how hard is it?
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.200]   Is it much, much harder than I even imagined?
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   Or is it really well?
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.800]   I just put my finger here, put a cap on this fret right over here, and then just do this,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.080]   this, this, this, and I'm done.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.440]   I mean, I'm thinking about how much I'm still resisting the urge to buy a game console,
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.600]   the Beatles rock band game.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.360]   It just looks like so much fricking fun, but I can't own a game console.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.060]   But I'm having so much fun just watching these videos, these gameplay videos that people
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.520]   are putting on the net.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:15.640]   And I would almost, I would be a possible market for these instrument, instrument videos
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   of iTunes if those were available.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.640]   If you had, you know, Eddie Van Halen saying, here's how I did the guitar lick on this
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   track.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   I mean, this is, you know, I mean, this is.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   I have a, I actually love him.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   He's like, he's like.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   Merlin's starting to cry now.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   It's got to go.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   I'm not going to play in my power.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   But maybe, do you think that maybe in some way it's sort of like trying to teach somebody
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.440]   to talk by saying, and now hold your mouth this way, move your tongue up to this way
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   and force the air out.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.000]   I mean, I've, I started trying to learn ukulele about, you know, four or five years ago.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.720]   There is this type of, there's a technique that George Formby created called the George
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.080]   Formby stroke.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.840]   And every instructional video that I've ever tried to download, it's made by somebody
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.360]   who mastered it 40 years ago and thinks this is the easiest thing in the world.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.080]   I just put, you just put your hand here, stroke down, down, up, down, down, up, down, and then
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   just down, down, down, down.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   See, it couldn't be simpler.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.320]   Meanwhile, I'm saying yes, but how are you stroking it?
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   Are you using your fingernail?
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.160]   Are you using the side of your thumb, the top of your thumb?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.920]   Presumably this is that's in here.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.640]   I'm downloading it.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   It's big.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   There's 600 megabytes.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   They're 499 each.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:37.720]   I have a, I have a, I have a use case or a business case for this personal story.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.160]   My daughter and I like to dance around to, wouldn't it be, you didn't have to be so nice
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   by the love and spoonful song.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   I like a lot.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   She likes a lot.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.280]   So I went and I did a search on YouTube so we could have our afternoon dance party and
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.960]   join some love and spoonful.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:55.200]   And it came up and there's this awesome video, which is I'm sure is totally illegal, of them
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.240]   on maybe like ready, steady go or something.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.320]   But it's from like when it was their second single and they put it out.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.800]   I swear this is going somewhere.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.360]   And it's delightful when we watch it and we dance around.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.280]   And then I notice in the right rail under related videos, there's a teaser of John Sebastian
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.000]   showing you how to play that.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.240]   You're supposed to buy the DVD or whatever.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.640]   So I hit it, I grabbed my guitar, my daughter loves when I play the guitar and I sat there
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   and watched the John Sebastian video and I learned how to play.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.240]   You didn't have to be so nice.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.360]   What's the moral of the story?
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.080]   Well, I don't wake up in the morning and go, I want to learn how to play welcome back
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.760]   cotter or whatever.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.160]   I learned about that because it's in context with something that I'm already doing.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.200]   So to your point, I think even to the social media point, I think people like things that
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   they can learn about from their friends, that they can have an opinion about share with
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   other people and then learning context.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.560]   You don't know what I mean?
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.720]   It doesn't make sense for that to just live on an island somewhere where you go, I'm in
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.960]   the mood to learn on rock band.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.560]   Or you could just play rock band.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.320]   I stopped talking because I'm watching Geddy Lee performing on rock band.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.080]   I just want to know if I make his voice do that.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   Hi!
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   Hi!
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.720]   This is really, I'm glad I didn't see this when I was 14.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   It's kind of pathetic.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.280]   I'm the one who's thinking Sean Penn watching this video.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.760]   He's got that kind of a nut.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   Geddy Lee does?
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   Sean Penn is Geddy Lee.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.920]   I could see the biopic.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.400]   So this is actually the band Rush performing.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.360]   I hope they don't do that right before concert because that could screw them up a lot.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.600]   You don't look, I'll be honest.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.800]   They look like they're having a lot of fun.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   They don't look happy.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   No.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   This is a real feel of one take.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   You know?
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   The car is still running.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   Let's get that out of here.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:43.480]   And so things I suck at playing drums on this song have been playing for 40 years.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.480]   Yeah, that's what's really said.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.160]   I've been live quite in the last five years and it was amazing.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   They're great.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   They're great.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.160]   They're still great.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   They're still great.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.520]   Like I say, by the way, they failed at the performance.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   They need Veronica up there with me.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.000]   Yeah, because I know how that feels.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.600]   You know, I feel much actually vindicated by the fact that you watched that DVD, Leo.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   Have you seen how badly we did?
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   Have you really seen how badly we did?
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   We.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   Even the one who failed, you did great.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   I love it.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   Oh, yeah, you failed out.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   Yeah, but you were playing the drums.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   I was just playing the bass.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.280]   I believe the bass on Still Alive is not hard to play.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.200]   But now that Rush failed on their own damn song, I feel better.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   That's, but this is okay.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.480]   But now why is this interesting?
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   Maybe it's not.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.240]   People in the chat room probably saying shut up, which is understandable.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.280]   But the thing about the YouTube thing that people don't get, universal music, right?
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.320]   All of these thousands and thousands of amazing artists, you can't embed their videos.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   It's insane.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   They're crazy.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.600]   There's all this power and like that is now the place where people go for a visual representation
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.720]   of the music that means a lot to them.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.960]   And then having, wait, with that in context is that's how you sell things.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.520]   You don't make people row out to some island with their wallet and then buy something.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520]   You put it where they already are.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.600]   It just seems so obvious to me.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.040]   It's largely a case of a label by label, a distributor by distributor thing.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.280]   So many of them do make that deal where they will, if you put up a really cool hit video
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.200]   of, I said, I said, I said, I copyrighted song to a slideshow and it's getting lots and
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   lots of hits.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.000]   There have been cases where the person who created the video said, Hi, nice copyright
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.400]   violation you got there.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.800]   Tell you what, we will let you keep it up if we allow us to tag this with an iTunes download
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   button.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   That's the way to do it.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.440]   And you will see a little pop up that will just simply come up just like any other YouTube
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.920]   ad that says, like the song, get it from, get it from Amazon, get it from iTunes, get
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   it from wherever.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.640]   And it does lead to hundreds of thousands of sales.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   It's the smart thing.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   Chris Brown made a ton of money on that wedding video.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Right, exactly.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.560]   And I think that's the way to go, especially since that we know that Google has the technology
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.080]   to simply automatically have robots look at videos and say, I see copyrighted music here.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.560]   Why don't I automatically tag this with the proper song download?
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   The person will get a little note, a polite little note is saying, Hi, no prop.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.080]   There's not a problem here, but it is copyrighted music.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.040]   I'm afraid we cannot allow it unless we allow us to put this link here.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.720]   It'll appear for the first five seconds.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   I don't want to be.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   I think they do that though, don't they?
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.280]   I see one, one I think that I'm curious about is the one where you see something like you'll
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.480]   see somebody using a Beatles song and it's, they haven't muted it.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.400]   You know, they'll mute it sometimes if they know there's IP violations in there.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.000]   But sometimes you'll see something that goes, it'll stay underneath something like this
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.800]   video contains copyrighted material of EMI.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.720]   Just the copyright one, go, huh?
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.120]   But it's, it's on like some guy's video of, you know, kid climbing a tree or whatever.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.120]   I don't, it's just weird.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.480]   It's my understanding that YouTube gives you three choices.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.680]   You can pull it down, you can erase the music or you can offer to sell the music.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.360]   I don't know if they offer that to everybody.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.680]   It's, it's just so strange to me.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.520]   And again, there's a reason I'm not in the corner office with, you know, Led Zeppelin's
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.800]   catalog, my pocket, but it seems so crazy to me that like you think about the millions,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.400]   literally at this point, billions of dollars that people spend trying to get someone's
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.840]   attention to come somewhere and do something and pay attention to something and you have
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.280]   this giant market of people who are just rabbit.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.360]   Every Friday afternoon, like I'm ready to go home.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.360]   I'm sitting around and playing around.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.200]   It seems like about every Friday afternoon I want to post a video by the police, but I
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.840]   can't because now Universal owns A&M.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.120]   You know, when you say a couple labels, now Universal, they own, I tried to do a, I tried
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.040]   to do a Google search of every un-embeddable video on Universal.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.880]   And I mean, there's definitely over a hundred thousand.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   There's all these, all these music is just so locked up.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.120]   It's just strange to me that they don't have a more mature model for making money off
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   of that.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.600]   And the rock band thing, I think is a terrific example.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.120]   I like, you know, I'm looking at this lesson and I have to say, I kind of, it makes me
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.720]   want to kind of learn how to play the guitar and doesn't look too hard.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.200]   I think these, it's kind of a shame there's only 18 of these celebrity lessons.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   Those are not hardcore, Leo.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.600]   Those are hardcores, Leo.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.960]   You could learn this song and you could be playing this within a month.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   Those are not hardcore.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   Well, kids do this.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.200]   I mean, I know, you know, everybody of my generation, this is how they learn how to
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   play a guitar.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.480]   They would listen to a song over and over and pick it out until they could figure it out.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.160]   But this way you're looking at it, you're seeing the, you know, you're seeing the, the
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.080]   frets, you're seeing him play.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   He's talking you through it.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   You're seeing the chords.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.440]   I think this is incredible didactic stuff.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.800]   And the pedagogy here is fantastic, but I don't understand why it's not.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   Why are they just letting it sit there?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.920]   I'm glad they got two more.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.760]   I mean, let's get some more in there.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   Maybe, are you thinking the artists are reluctant to do this?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.480]   Gina, do you play an instrument?
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   I don't.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   I don't.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   I dabbled around piano when I was younger.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.840]   I mean, I got to get some Merlin's point earlier is like getting this stuff out to people in
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   context.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   It's so true.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.440]   I swear every single new programming thing, for example, that I've learned, I learned
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.640]   during like about a procrastination.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.200]   So I was supposed to be doing something else and like some tutorial caught my eye online.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   It's so true.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.440]   And so I haven't played with the garage band stuff.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   And I heard about it.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   I was like, that sounds awesome.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   I got to check it out.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   But like I just never, you know, went to the island.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   Got a good one.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.160]   I mean, think about the extent to which we all rely on each other.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.040]   You know, Corey's called it the information, what is called the information economy or
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   whatever.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.920]   We rely on other people happily.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.880]   I happily rely on other people to do a giant amount of the cognitive load for me.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   It's not a mech thing.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.320]   But anyway, I want to see those opportunities.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.280]   And I see a bunch of people with briefcases running around going, stop looking at this.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.080]   Oh, I agree with you.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   It's bizarre.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   That's the dream, man.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.580]   You know, that's wow.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.980]   I mean, it's awesome.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.280]   Apple has rehired a Newton developer, speaking of developers.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.860]   Michael Chow, who was one of the developers of Apple's Newton, which isn't that long ago.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.820]   It feels like a million years ago, but it was only 1993.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   He's been gone for 15 years.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.180]   He's been working at Nike.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:39.700]   He was at Apple through 94, spent a few years consulting, then became the general manager
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.340]   of the Nike Tech Lab, that's Nike plus iPod products came out of his lab.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:49.340]   And they've hired him back to be, what is the name of the title?
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.940]   Let me see if I can find that.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.700]   It's a pretty vice president.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.060]   Is a vice president marketing a vice president product marketing, I think.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.060]   Reports directly to Phil Schiller.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.220]   I think that's an interesting acquisition.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.820]   Well, it's a natural.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.420]   It doesn't necessarily point to a tablet device because his whole career has all been about
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.180]   consumer electronics portables.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.180]   Right.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:22.300]   And as a Newton was in its way a media device, his work at Nike suggests more ambitious integration
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.780]   with the stuff that you already have right now.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.260]   Obviously, when I've seen this retweeted and reposted 40 times, it's always seen as a
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.220]   tablet piece of news.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.860]   But I'm really not sure.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:40.340]   I think that if any future Apple tablet resembles the Apple the Newton message pad, that was
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.780]   a long time ago.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.220]   That was like one whole three whole Bush administrations ago.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.260]   So I'm not sure that that's like a significant data point.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.660]   It's clear that this gentleman has moved on since then.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.900]   Well, it's interesting because according to the times he's the guy who convinced John
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.780]   Scully to do the new in the first place.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.020]   So the other thing is sometimes it's a little bit myopic, in my opinion, to go to be as
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.460]   literal about going, "Oh, well, because this person did X."
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.300]   And it was 16 years ago.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.180]   I'll say that, but I mean, I think a lot of times you hire talent because they know how
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.740]   to do a certain kind of relationship inside a certain industry.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:22.300]   So if I saw somebody hire the guy who did a Nike Apple co-brand that took a giant amount
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:29.060]   of cooperation and probably negotiation, to me that would say a lot more about their
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.340]   ability to work with potentially contentious relationships than within a hardware.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.340]   Anybody hardware is just hard.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.900]   Maybe he's going to handle AT&T.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.060]   Could be hiring for his roller deaths.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.900]   I mean, it's not as interesting as my roost.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   And the other possibility...
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.900]   The other possibility...
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.900]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   I'm not done.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.820]   The other possibility is simply that we know that he's been working closely with Apple
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.100]   with a lot of different Nike products.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.700]   So which means that he's been in and out of that office all the time.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.540]   He still is a very close relationship.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.700]   I'm sorry for that, but he has a very close relationship with lots of people on that
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:05.620]   campus and that when someone at Apple realizes, "You know, we really need another mobile
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.980]   devices vice president.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   Let's start the hunt."
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.500]   You know who we should call?
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.460]   He was right in the office three days ago.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.460]   "Oh, okay.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.460]   We're calling Mike.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.700]   Maybe he's not going to go for it, but we should ask him first."
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   It could be as simple as that.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.700]   Makes perfect sense.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.340]   Have you guys seen...
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.340]   This is exciting to me.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.180]   Gina, you've been paying attention to this light peak.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.740]   Intel announced this at the IDF, the Intel Developers Forum, but it turns out Apple was
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.620]   very much behind this.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:42.340]   In fact, it was Steve Jobs going to Paul Adelini saying, "We need a fiber-based, really fast
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.260]   connection."
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.260]   The idea...
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.500]   Much like Firewire, which was an adapt tech Intel Apple creation.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:39:00.820]   The idea is this is a 100-gigabit connection that could go up as fast as 400 gigabits, depending
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.820]   on...
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.940]   According to Dvorak, very easily, very quickly.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.460]   I'm sorry, it starts at 10 gigabits.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   They could get up to 100 gigabits.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.620]   This is for close connections, right?
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.260]   You know, I don't know how far it is.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.300]   Where would you get that kind of pipe?
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.460]   There's lots of reasons you might want that.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.380]   Locally, but if you've got giant amounts of computer data that you're moving around
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.380]   inside of a light.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.380]   That's what it's for.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:34.740]   You could think of it almost as a replacement to Firewire or a response to USB 3.0.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   It's a fiber-interconnect.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.740]   It's basically an object.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.740]   Maybe like video.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   It would be like video.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   If you're doing HDO video, you would...
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.740]   That's how it been with.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.340]   I still can't believe it when I'm trying to...
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   It really feels like something from another century, I guess it is, when I'm pulling down,
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.380]   even with Firewire, pulling stuff off of a video camera.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.140]   It's amazing how long that takes and how air is.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.660]   It's slow, that's right.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.260]   Remember, like, without doing stuff at Pixel Core, I just remember that was always kind
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.500]   of the critical path part, which how long it took to render that stuff, move it around.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.500]   It's also very expensive.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.260]   Yeah, it's very, very expensive.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.900]   We're going to buy a sand device for a video so we can record and edit the video on this
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.900]   device.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.420]   We're talking 20 grand.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.220]   And then you have to get fiber channel.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:21.980]   So a consumer level, high speed, 10 gigabit connection up to 100 gigabits is pretty exciting.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.020]   You always say, "Well, what do you need all that bandwidth for?"
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.220]   I thought I couldn't see where you needed.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.020]   I'm just kind of like having one walkie-talkie.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.500]   I'm just wondering, you wouldn't see that.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.500]   I guess just want to clarify.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.060]   You wouldn't see that on the internet, for example.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.380]   That was the same complaint.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.380]   I keep interrupting.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.380]   Oh, I keep interrupting.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.900]   My core competency, I'm sorry.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:51.500]   No, I was going to say was that USB was also limited until everyone seemed to jump on board.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.820]   I think the really big plus of this sort of interface would be, instead of having, if
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.460]   I turned my iMac around, I could see about four different kinds of ports I have on the
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.460]   back.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:06.660]   If instead, I just got six ports of the exact same flavor.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.820]   Let's fast forward two or three years from now, knowing that I don't have to have USB
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.380]   and a different connector for the video and a different connector for the high speed hard
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:19.020]   drive that simply I have six ports I can spread out however I want between different monitors,
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.220]   different input devices, different storage devices.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.460]   That would be a pretty big win.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.380]   I really would like to know if this is just for near networking or if it's something that
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.020]   I could use, I could snake all the way throughout the house and get that kind of HD streaming
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.980]   everywhere I wanted to go.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.980]   If it's for each other.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   Yeah, I mean, that's my child.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   You said work.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.980]   Sorry.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.020]   It keeps me from running from the office to the living room with a thumb drive in my hand.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   You know, sneaker net, that's great.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.740]   I'm always looking for waist bovoid exercise.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.540]   That's a very good point.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.540]   I think, I mean, I don't know that I'm looking at, maybe I can find some more information
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:59.540]   on this from Intel, but I think this would go at least as far as firewire, if not as
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.540]   far as ethernet.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.500]   I would imagine it goes far as ethernet.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   It's optical.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.580]   I've always wondered what it's funny and you use that word snake.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   Whoa.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   Sorry.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.580]   Did it connect?
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.580]   I sold there.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.580]   Yeah, you just connected your mic.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   Just connected.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   That was really cool.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.580]   Can you do that again?
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   Sure.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   Absolutely.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.580]   I probably will several times.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.140]   You don't want to see the Byzantine setup.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.660]   I've got to do this, but I'm remembering that when you play music, there's something
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.740]   called a snake and a snake is the thing that runs from the board where the recording
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.500]   are mixing you up to the stage and enables you to have a kind of tidy mechanism for all
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.260]   the mics and DIs and everything to run in one line.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.460]   That's kind of been the dream for me.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.740]   I've always wished that there was one oo report out of the side of any machine.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:48.300]   There was a modest size hole that could then, like you say, maybe not need six plugs.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.620]   To me, that's always kind of been the dream.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.900]   I guess firewars kind of close to that.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.060]   But if you had like some.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.140]   This sounds like this would replace everything.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.580]   It's very cheap to implement.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.580]   I mean, this light peak is very intriguing.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.820]   Actually, actually, now that they think of it, we're still thinking in terms of old-style
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.980]   peripherals.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.660]   What if it's not just I have six ports?
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.660]   I can plug six things in.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.980]   It means that I have one big backbone that can handle the traffic of every device I'm
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.460]   going to plug in there.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:18.060]   And so, you know, according to our chatroom, a hundred meters, that's good.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.060]   Okay.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.060]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.060]   That's everywhere you want to be in there.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.060]   It's a whole house.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.060]   Yep.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.060]   Only make it to the end of the drive.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.900]   What do you guys have there?
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:34.100]   I still use Windows XP to do IP over firewire with my Mac, because it's not in Vista or 7
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   either.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.100]   There's no firewire support.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.380]   I have an IP over firewire with it.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.380]   So I would love this.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.660]   As long as it was one plug and you could daisy chain it, you know, you can have a backbone
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.660]   and talk to everything.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.660]   I'll be fantastic.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.700]   Well, yeah, think about it, because now you have a 10 gigabit network going up to, they
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.300]   said they could fairly easily go to 40 or 50 gigabits.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.940]   Boy, that would just be, that would be very nice.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.140]   Faster than the hard drive, you know, although hard drives will catch up inevitably.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.940]   How will porn keep up?
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.460]   I mean, it's good.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.940]   Things are a lot more expensive, a lot more most.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.940]   Did you say how to porn keep up?
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   How does porn keep up?
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.940]   You know what?
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.260]   It just reminds me of Microsoft Word and the Mac.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   And this is true of everything.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   It's so funny.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.300]   I gene in this, but other than anybody, it's so funny how there's just constant spiral
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.980]   of, you know, the different things like software functionality, hardware functionality, and
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.300]   you just keep pushing each other up and up and up.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.140]   And I was writing about this on my site the other day, kind of complaining about some
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   applications.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.900]   And I'd mentioned Microsoft Word 6 when it came out.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.460]   And I remember it was like, wow, I finally had this really fast computer because it's
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.580]   SC30 and it's working so great with 5.1.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.860]   But then I put 6 on there and it would grind to a halt.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:36.860]   Right.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.860]   Right.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.820]   I almost wonder like, you know, with stuff like that, it just seems like sometimes you're
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.580]   happy to see all this extra functionality and bandwidth.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.220]   And then sometimes what that really means is you go, oh crap.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.540]   When that is not there.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.420]   Well, we're still, I mean, that's something like Dropbox, for example.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.300]   Yeah, it's great that I've got 50 gigs I can carry around.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.700]   But when that breaks, that means 50 gigs are broken.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.700]   A lot more lost.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.700]   A lot more clues.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.840]   And when you're accustomed to being on a sustained 20, 20 meg connection and it goes
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.820]   away, it's kind of alarming how much you realize how far you've come when that goes
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   away.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.940]   You know, so I think it's going to be because you're describing becomes like an appliance,
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.220]   not an appliance, but you do it.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.460]   But you're describing becomes almost like having electric in the house.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   Big old pack.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   Big old pack.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.180]   So, you know, imagine you've got all your computers hooked up with light peak.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.020]   You sit down at one computer and you pick any hard drive you want to work off of in the
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   house.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.540]   Suddenly the machine is just a keyboard and then you can pick any hard drive because
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.880]   it's, you know, the read right is just as fast as if the hard drive was connected to
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.280]   the keyboard that you're typing on.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   And let's not forget.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.740]   I mean, we're talking a lot about 1080p, but 4K video isn't that far off.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.880]   It's within the next 10 years.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.400]   And that's that's quadruple the resolution.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.640]   It's double the width and double the height resolution of HD.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.880]   Imagine what color no Brian's going to look like in that.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.440]   Well, you know what it is really it's telepresence.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.720]   So if you have a great screen and a 4K screen and you have a fast pipe, you know, you're
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.700]   seeing people as if they're really there.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.700]   There.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.380]   So I think that that's in our I don't think that's so far off.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.140]   It's before I'm in the nursing home anyway.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.660]   I wonder if that'll make two and a half men funnier.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.500]   No, and everyone's gonna have to be beautiful to be on TV.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.700]   No, you know, I think as the opposite effect that you start to realize that everybody is
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   normal.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   Well, that's a fact.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.700]   I don't know Brian.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.700]   I don't know Brian was one that really stuck out.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.300]   I have to say it looks like he's wearing a mask.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.780]   But some it is funny.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:37.280]   You really see you see who really kind of categorically gorgeous and who was like, wow,
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.880]   you know, that's not a fair comparison because you know, Brian has that big Kennedy style
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   head.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.600]   So it's like 2040 P. You know, in his resolution.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.300]   I wonder I wonder if because you know, I have a big head to and in the old days, big heads
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.400]   were considered good for television, but I wonder if those days are gone.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   I think so.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.240]   If you want to be a model or you want to be on TV, it helps to be a good pinhead like
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   me.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.240]   You know, I think you don't look as good.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.520]   Yeah, I mean, let's just for those of you watching at home, just a little comparison
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   here.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   Merlin, Gina.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   Merlin, Gina.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   Who's who's cuter?
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:17.000]   A big head always wins.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.920]   As if we now need to hit you guys over the head chat from, yes, we are fishing for compliments
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   about our luck.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   Okay.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   Why do we have to keep asking?
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.400]   I'm just, I don't look at the chat run.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   I'm scared.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   I got a haircut two months ago.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   I will notice.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.720]   Here's something that's annoying, a little annoying to me.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.440]   You know, when you download QuickTime, we're going to do this and then we're going to
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   do our picks of the week.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.240]   When you download QuickTime or iTunes on Windows, Apple puts this little updater on there and
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.640]   you know, they keep trying to sneak stuff in.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.200]   First, it was Safari, right?
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.760]   Then, and now look at this.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.720]   They're trying to push an enterprise configuration utility, the iPhone configuration utility.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.320]   Have you seen this Gina on your Windows machines?
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   I have.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.320]   I disabled it immediately.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   That updater thing.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.320]   So I haven't seen it.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   There is a way to disable it.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.920]   And I'm actually, I'm looking it up right now.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.120]   Please, because they just keep stacking.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   Sorry.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.320]   Is this the thing in the developers?
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   Crap.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.400]   They just, they just keep stacking.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.920]   It's not a developer thing.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   And that's the thing.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.920]   It's not that thing where you go let go.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.720]   I, because there's a really cool app that's hidden in the developer package where you could
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.280]   go in and say, oh, from now on, I want all the iPhones in my company to have this set
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   up.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   That's what this is.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   Oh, it's a neat app.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Oh, okay, okay.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.880]   But there's no reason to push that on Windows users on unsuspecting Windows.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.240]   You can hack on your phone with it though.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   It's pretty cool.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.160]   It lets you create, maintain, encrypt, and install configuration profiles, track and
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.320]   install provisioning.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.320]   This must be a mistake.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.320]   Apple couldn't really want people to have this.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.160]   So we're talking about the Apple software update utility.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   Yes.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   Okay.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.560]   It pushes new software is available from Apple, the iPhone configuration utility.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   Hmm.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.640]   That feels, I gotta say, that feels like an error to me.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.680]   That is, if I remember I had the iPhone SDK and I'm pretty sure it's, that's where that
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   is.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.880]   I think it's part of the, yeah, I don't think it's, it's not a consumer.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:12.280]   The key menu item is on the tools menu, the ignore selected updates.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.600]   So you select all the updates and you just ignore and then you don't get, then you don't
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.760]   get notified anymore.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.520]   I mean, which is, you know, some things you want.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   I want iTunes.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.440]   They don't noise me that quick time comes with iTunes, but fine.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.640]   But like this mobile me control panel, for example.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   I don't like that.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.920]   I'm a car, I don't use mobile me.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   It's clunky.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   It's clunky to do that.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.560]   You know, it's, it's almost like, you know, kind of unrelated, but related.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.960]   I don't, I can't remember in the last probably 12 years ever deliberately signing up to be
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.960]   on the receive optional email because you bought this list.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.280]   And yet I apparently am all the time for everything.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   All it takes is one check box.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   You forgot to uncheck.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.320]   But I, I mean, I'm telling you, I scan the page and I never, I always uncheck it.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.960]   If I see it, I guess what I'm saying is it's an upsetting expectation that I have to say,
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:01.640]   I know for myself that hurts my feeling of credibility for the people that sent that
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   to me.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.200]   And I wonder how much benefit Apple gets out of doing that stuff.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.240]   Because I, I got a bunch of pals who are serious, like Windows nerds that, you know,
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.080]   use iTunes and it's, they're like, you know, they're super frustrated with those things.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.520]   They, they do not like, because again, what, what makes you a Windows nerd is you're super
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   careful about what shows up on your box.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   Exactly.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.560]   You know, once I'm, you know, this goofy company with the white, you know, music things to
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.880]   be like pushing all the stuff out at you all the time, you know, it's bad.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.200]   It's bad PR anyway.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.560]   I think it's got to be a mistake.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.320]   But yeah, the whole opt out thing is, is bogus.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.240]   But even when you install leopard or snow leopard, you know, there's a, you're automatically,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.760]   you know, you have to opt out.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   You have to uncheck the box.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   Right.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   Box is always checked.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   You do have to uncheck it.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:47.320]   Although, I mean, I'm always, I'm always an accountant and I always have zero employees.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.800]   I think that's a certain point.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   That's good.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   I love percentage.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   Well, what percentage?
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   Stupid me.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.680]   I keep looking for a podcaster in that list of occupations.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   They never put it in here.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.440]   I was in it with all forms with forced, with forced entry.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.440]   Is it the first entry?
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.600]   Because that's my silent, like I know I'm not a guy.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.680]   I've never mentioned this before.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.400]   I don't think, but like I always pick the first option, no matter what it is.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.640]   Because if they ever do decide to do that, I want to know like, you don't need to know
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.960]   how many people work for me.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.280]   Like, why are you asking me that?
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.320]   You know, it's like, how is that useful for me?
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   You know?
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.160]   I live on 123 Main Street, FYI.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.400]   You have to be careful with domain names.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.960]   You got to be careful with domain names though.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   Like Matt Hohnen just got his ass handed to him because he'd done some 123 stuff.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.240]   The problem is what you described, Gina, like what you do.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   What happened to him?
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   What happened?
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.680]   Have you ever put in 123 Main Street for your domain names?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.880]   Like everybody used to do?
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.400]   I get the private registration.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.560]   I can will rule in favor of anybody who can prove that that's not your address.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   Ooh.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.600]   And so you lose your domain silence.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.920]   So you have to pay the extra.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   I do this too, but it's right.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   I do it too.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   It's good, Daddy.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.920]   I pay for it.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   But it's like expensive.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   But to your point, you know, so yeah, we shut off.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.440]   It almost becomes like over filtering your mail on a certain way.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.480]   Like, do you don't want to unintentionally shut off the update that keeps something running
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.280]   and then you never know again, it fails silently.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.160]   You never know that something went wrong.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.440]   And that's where this credibility stuff really matters.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:13.640]   You know, if you, when you start mixing up PR sales, marketing and technology in a way
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.680]   that's deliberately confusing, you lose a giant amount of credibility.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.960]   It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.120]   But if you say to people, here's the kind of things you can expect in this pipeline,
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.920]   but then I'm going to break it when I've got something I want you to buy.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.040]   That's that hurts your credibility so much with people, at least it does for me anyway.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.920]   Apple is definitely going for the gaming market.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.200]   There's an ad on the IGN game site.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.960]   Well, I'll play a little bit of it for you that shows Apple's interest.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.400]   You know, they said, in fact, that maybe maybe Steve Jobs wasn't lying when he said that
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.120]   the reason they didn't put a camera on the iPod touch is because he wanted to keep it
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.040]   cheap for the gaming market.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   And now that the PSP go is out at a higher price, I think, than the lowest cost iPod touch,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.840]   maybe that's more credible.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.120]   This is the this is the ad on IGN.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.280]   Next level on iPod touch.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.360]   Takes over the whole site, by the way.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:16.520]   I'm sorry in the past, you're my poly violated copyright here, but it's a big ad showing
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   iPod touches playing against head to head against each other as many as three.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.720]   It takes over the whole IGN page.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:28.400]   And as they steer and move it around, it even moves the menu bar around and it says, once
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.680]   again, the funnest iPod ever.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   Hmm.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.960]   That was I would do anything in my power to never buy that thing and to make sure that
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.320]   everybody I know never ever buys ever.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.800]   The iPod touch?
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   That's offensive.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   My God.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   Have to say that.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.000]   No, I mean, like, but that no, no, I mean, like the publisher who does that.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.920]   Like, what does that say to your there's a name?
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   There's a term for that.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.720]   I can't remember what it is where you take over a page.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   Yeah, I'm a jerk.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   That's good.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   Right.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   That is true.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.960]   Yeah, he's a jerk for one to make sure he makes his payroll that all the people whose
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.400]   livelihoods depend on his business get to feed their children.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.480]   Oh, we're seeing a side of Merlin, man.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.200]   You've been hoping to see for a long, long time.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   He's a socialist.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   He's a socialist.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.400]   If the page moves, it's too much.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.080]   If you can't get that, I don't think that's I don't think I'm being fancy.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.920]   I think if the page moves and it's a place where people get news, I think that's too
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.920]   much.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.080]   And I think when I go to SFK, the entire page peels away, like somebody just got Kai's
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.680]   power tools and a biz dev deal, that kills credibility.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.880]   And if that makes me sound like a hypocrite, fine.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   That's dumb.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   Like, what?
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   Who's happy to see that ad?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   Nobody.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.880]   Who's happy to see that?
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   It's compulsory.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   It's compulsory.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   I think flash and shockwave developers are happy to see it because they're like, wow,
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.960]   this is the way I can build it in my ads.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.440]   How they do that?
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.440]   Has he written a paper?
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.440]   It is funny, boy.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.560]   You know, when you run an ad block on Firefox and then sometimes I'll see my wife and I
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   both read SFK.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.520]   It's like the local paper thing.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.440]   And boy, that site looks pretty different.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.520]   It's it's really crazy.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.520]   It's over.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.440]   You can't blame them for trying to monetize.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.440]   And speaking of monetization.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.440]   I can't really can.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   I can.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.440]   Let me just peel back.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.440]   You know, I wish I had I think I do have this.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.440]   Let me see.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.440]   I have run advertising.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   I'm not against advertising.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:19.440]   I'm going to peel back because underneath this underneath this ad, underneath this podcast.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   That's awesome.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.440]   Right here.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   There's an audible ad.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.440]   Look at that.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   I just peeled it right back.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   See, that was good.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.440]   That's good.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.440]   They call that my product placement.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   They call that.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   It's really bad back.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.680]   Ah, there we go.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.960]   We are going to take a break and come back with your picks of the week.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.520]   And I didn't really warn Merlin and Gina about that.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.320]   But so you guys, if you if you don't have a pick, I think you're working on one.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   But if you don't have a pick, it's okay.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.080]   But Andy and I will have our picks of the week.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.160]   And I'll have kind of.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:55.000]   You have been working on it.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.400]   Twitter said that Marlon should choose Microsoft security essentials, which was just released
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   today as his big.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   Did it come out today?
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   It did.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   My God, I see that's what I was waiting.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.000]   I was going to be my one for next time.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Okay.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.360]   My pick is brought to you by Carl's Jr.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.600]   Sir, I would like to pick the Microsoft security.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.000]   Sir, the essentials.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.800]   Brought to you by.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.000]   Let me.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.240]   Brought to you by slow love.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.640]   Not like the lights down low and give it a pull.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   All right, real quickly.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   It's a curling.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.720]   Can you see the curl it on?
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   The curls good.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   The curls working.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.720]   It's working.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   It's like behind this behind this podcaster.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.000]   It's the Carl's Jr. ad.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.680]   Oh, Lord, for those of you listening to the audio portion of this show, I do just have
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.520]   our deepest apologies.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   Imagine.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.160]   Imagine something that we think is funny is happening.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   That's all you need to know.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.400]   No, it's not.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   It's that simple.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   We got to have the service from from PBS.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.840]   And now Merlin is holding a three and a half by five card with the words Carl's Jr.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   written on it.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.240]   He is peeling back the left corner to mimic the function of a page girl Photoshop plugin.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.040]   Yeah, he speaks into a microphone.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.440]   Gina, so had.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.240]   Merlin is still.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.480]   And the anasto remains motionless.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.760]   Distracted by something off to camera left.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.720]   Is that what they do for operas?
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.720]   Or movies.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.320]   I rather doing it.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.680]   So I want to just briefly mention audible.com that our picks of the week will be we'll be
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:42.440]   with you in a moment audible.com/macbreak is the website to go to to get your free book.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.120]   It's where you sign up for the gold account on audible.com.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.480]   I am an I just finished Game of Thrones.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.920]   Oh my goodness.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:56.680]   What a, you know, what an incredible season finale in that book.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.680]   It's amazing.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.840]   But the good news is on Game of Thrones.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.160]   I think there's there's five volumes in the song of ice and fire.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.000]   So there's more there.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Seven.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.960]   Yeah, according to the idea where I just learned what this is.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.680]   Seven epic fantasy series.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.920]   Oh, by George RR Martin.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.320]   Do you know George RR Martin?
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   Yeah, do you know George RR Martin?
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.320]   Huh?
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.320]   I'm just looking up on Wikipedia.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.320]   It's based on the game.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   It looks like.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.800]   No, there's going to be a game on it.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.960]   There's like a magic of the following game and whatever it is.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.560]   And then there's a movie or I'm sorry, mini series, I think.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.560]   Coming up.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.320]   Fantasy books be so nice on audio.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   Really?
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   I think they translate well sometimes.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   Well, this one's kind of neat.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.320]   You know, as Brian Brushwood pointed out that even though it is kind of a fantasy book, it
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.080]   really is almost like a historical fiction about a time that never existed because it's
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.400]   very it's kind of very much like the the war of the roses, the York and the York and the
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.520]   Lancaster's is not it's the Starks and the Lannisters.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.640]   But it's it many ways it feels like that kind of era.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.960]   I wasn't going to make this my pick of the week, but I just I just finished the first
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.440]   volume and now I've got four more or five more to go.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.840]   Thirty three hours.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   Just incredible.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.080]   If you like that kind of fiction, there's plenty here at audible for you, but that's
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.080]   not all.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.640]   There's also history and and biography.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:16.680]   I do now my new book.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:23.400]   I just started is the accidental billionaires, the Ben Mesric book about the founding of Facebook.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   There are best sellers.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.600]   Of course, the Dan Brown novel is there.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.800]   Sixty thousand titles.

[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.800]   Oh, look at this.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.320]   Atlas shrugged his on sale was forty ninety seven.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   Now just eight dollars ninety five cents.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.240]   Just charging you for the problem you'll probably get through before you give up.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   Yeah, six.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.000]   You could have got never less if you weren't so weak.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.880]   Also also known as the Ulysses discount.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880]   Sixty three.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.520]   Sixty three hours.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.680]   God, I'm going to quote my poetry teacher at this point.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.240]   There's no there's no need for that book to ever end.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.600]   It might as well just go on forever.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   Let me play.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.000]   I got to play with Scott brick is one of their best narrators.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   The collectivism within man's salt.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.880]   It showed the nature and function of the creator and the second hander.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:32.520]   This is from the former primary concern there was with Roark and Tui showing what they are.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.000]   I wish they'd picked like a really passionate point from it.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.120]   And read I bought thirty dollars with a typewriter paper and damn it, I'm going to use it on every
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.840]   page.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.120]   You can also get a right money away.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.840]   Eight ninety five also for the fountainhead.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.440]   That's a little bit shorter, only thirty two hours or anthom.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.320]   I don't think I ever read anthom.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   Good video.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.160]   Good video of rush covering anthem.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160]   You can check it out.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.200]   My kind of guy is a hidden track.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.960]   I doubt that I know this because I don't listen to rush.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.640]   But it was a hidden track on the live in Rio DVD and it's really good.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.440]   It's then playing anthem from like is right after Neil joined.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.080]   You should Google it up on the YouTube.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080]   It's really good.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   I will Google it up on the YouTube.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.800]   You know Neil's very into the into very into the and.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   I'm raising really.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   Did you know that?
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.680]   Oh no, he's listening to the lyrics.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.960]   Anthem is based on the short story anthem.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.600]   It's based on the book anthem.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.080]   Yeah, especially that part that goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but it's all his lyrics.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.240]   Neil writes all the lyrics and he's very into.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.200]   For example, you know, you could choose a ready guide.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.960]   Just for example, in some celestial voice, you could choose not to decide, but you know,
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.880]   you still have made a choice.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.280]   You could choose from fan of fears, kind of sick and kill.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.520]   I'll choose a path that's clear.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   I will choose free will.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   I'm touched and moved.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520]   Why am I on?
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   I like Russia.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.960]   You're on here for the Canadiana for the.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.880]   Sorry, I don't like I and ran at all, but I do enjoy rush.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.080]   You know, you can get it either way.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.120]   What ever do people listen to the whole book like that?
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   You can.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   Like 30.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.120]   I ran for that long.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.480]   I'm telling you the the song of ice and fire.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.480]   Each one of those is 30 hours.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   It's like a hundred fifty hours.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480]   It's a great deal, though.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.480]   That's the funny part.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   I don't mind.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   I get sucked into it.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480]   I love it.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   I know.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.400]   I'll get these and I'll go like, like seven hours and then like I go, wow, it's halfway
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.480]   done and it's so absorbing sometimes.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.880]   Yeah, that's the key.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.920]   So, you know, long or short, get a great book.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.160]   Do you have any normally we ask Andy for a recommendation?
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.960]   I I've been leaving you out.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.200]   I think you've made a hell of a nice pair of recommendations and I'll save mine for next
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   week.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   Great.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.800]   I might be on my this is my pick was an is an 18 hour one.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.440]   I'm only I'm only four hours into it and I've got a four hour round trip drive as soon as
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.920]   this show ends.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.960]   So I'm actually I'm actually I'm not looking forward to the drive.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.480]   I'm just hating it less because I know that I'll have good.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.840]   Maybe I'll get to the point where so and so is probably going to be here.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.280]   I want it by the time I get back home.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.560]   Okay, good to get this work.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   It's so great.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   If you've got a long drive, I've got a long fly.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.720]   I'm going to Dubai next week.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   That's going to be a long flight.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720]   I'm just stocking up.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.280]   Audiobooks from audible.com.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.560]   Get your first one free audible.com slash Mac break.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.440]   Thank you so much for their support of map break.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.120]   Since I didn't give you a book pick, Andy, why don't you give us a pick for the Mac?
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.480]   We'll take a Mac pick.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.600]   Filemaker came up with a new version of bento that got released just today.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.720]   It is the missing piece of software from iWork missing in the sense that it's not done
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.480]   under the Apple label, even though file maker is an Apple company.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.080]   And they want to give you they want to get 50 bucks out of you just for this database
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.280]   application.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.000]   But it is exactly what a database Apple would look like if Apple were designing it themselves.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.160]   If you just want to use it as a personal and home media application, that's fine.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.560]   Forget that it's a database program.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.920]   Just realize it's loaded with all these templates so that no matter what it is that you're trying
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.080]   to organize, no matter what kind of business project, what kind of personal or home project,
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.440]   this probably template built in for getting a wedding put together, running a soccer team,
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440]   whatever.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.720]   But it also has these really awesome and simple tools for building really building your
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.600]   own software that manages information.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.920]   And this is version three.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.240]   Most of the tweaks rely on its integration with iPhoto.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:28.760]   Now if you're trying to keep on top of a house remodel, now instead of pasting manually,
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.160]   here's a picture of what the frames most look like.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.360]   Here's a picture of the bathroom fixture that I really want to use.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.040]   Instead of really having that separate from your iPhoto library, now you can simply have
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.080]   an iPhoto library, for example, that just has everything that's related to the project
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.280]   or separate libraries for different phases of it.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.400]   And then simply link to those iPhoto elements and libraries within your bento databases.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:57.240]   So you can do some really powerful and slick looking templates and software solutions.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.320]   And the other cool thing, I haven't received it yet.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.680]   I had an early data that I've played around with but haven't really gotten, dived into.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.320]   The other real thing I really like about this update is that it makes it really easy to
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.000]   share your database libraries.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.480]   So just like you can have one big pile of music on one machine in your house and then have
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.440]   a bunch of different iTunes apps across the house that tap into it, you can have the same
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:26.320]   database of information in the office that now five different copies of bento throughout
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   the house or throughout the office can then tap into and access and work with.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.800]   So as usual, you're getting a hell of a lot, I think, for 50 bucks.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.880]   It's 50 bucks is not nothing.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.440]   That's certainly not the $50 for three apps that you get via iWork, but it's like the
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.160]   genie wish that I'm a genie for a third wish.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   I want more wishes.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   That's what bento gives you.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.840]   You can build any more apps with it.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   The other announcement.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   Is it easy?
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.240]   Can I just ask you real quickly, is it like file maker in its extensibility or is it kind
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.400]   of a stripped down file maker?
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.520]   It's not so much stripped out so much that it's designed to be used in more of a flat
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   file context.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   I see.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.240]   So it's not relational, but you have the ability to design forms as you do in file maker.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.800]   You can design forms, you can do links between databases and links between forms.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   That's usual.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   I believe you can.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.880]   I'm not a database expert, so maybe someone's going to tell me, wait, this is totally
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   relational.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   I'm saying, well, I have relational problems.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   It's not relational.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   It sure feels like it.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.720]   I mean, it's a, I used to do a tiny bit of file maker or consulting stuff in the late
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.320]   90s very badly.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.160]   And it's basically, if you can imagine like file maker, but it's really just a simple
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   gooey.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.440]   You throw stuff around, you start with one of these templates, the fantastic templates,
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.680]   and the only thing I would have is the iPhone app is terrific.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.520]   It's a really good iPhone app too.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   That's right.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.000]   There's an iPhone app that works at the standalone app, but also syncs extremely well between
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.280]   the desktop version and the iPhone version.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.040]   There was a, there's a small piece of info, a piece of data in the press release and in
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.760]   like the user page saying, oh, and by the way, we're going to be releasing a fix for the
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   iPhone version.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.120]   Anyway, so take a look at these new table forms because there've been a bunch of compatibility
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.040]   problems between the iPhone app and 3.0, the operating system.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.880]   And so they're basically promising that those are even having problems with the iPhone
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   with the real world fixer.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.640]   Anyway, so iPhone integration once again, you can have it, you know, I hadn't used it
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   to bro.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.360]   But I had, I used it for a while as I was kind of before before we'll put out the delicious
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.840]   library iPhone app.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840]   I was using it.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.120]   I was trying to do my own kind of little ad hoc bibliography thing.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   And it was working.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.320]   I mean, again, before it broke, but it's a pretty, I think I thought it was a pretty nice
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.760]   iPhone app in terms of use and stuff and the syncing was great.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.880]   Is the app free the iPhone app if you're, if you already have bent over the iPhone app
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.480]   is so I do want to say it's like five or 10 bucks.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.160]   I don't think it's free.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.680]   But only I had some four 99.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.720]   I'm looking at a four 99.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720]   So that's pretty.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:46.240]   And even as a flat as a flat database program, five bucks is not a whole lot of money for
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.640]   a program as good as that.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   There's also a handy base.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.200]   I can build that in a weekend.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   It's trivial.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.160]   I built it right now while you were bragging about how you could break it.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.120]   But I deleted it just to spite you.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.080]   That's a little care about it.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   So easy to make.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.280]   And you had another announcement you wanted to make?
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:09.080]   No, I'm probably going to be heading off right now to start driving to National New
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.080]   Hampshire.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   I'm giving you a talk at the National Public Library at six thirty or seven.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.080]   All right.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.000]   You might be able to see me at the Agawom diner because they have really incredibly good
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.840]   pie and it's sort of between here and Nashua.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.080]   Well, I'll look for pictures of the Agawom diner on your Flickr page.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   Awesome.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.600]   There's there's I should tell you right now there is a picture of if you look, if you
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.720]   do a search for Agawom diner in my Flickr feed, there is a picture of a lemon meringue pie.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.200]   That's going to say, you know what, wait in that way at the house.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.400]   I'll be by like in two seconds and I want to go to the Agawom diner with you.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.720]   That's the kind of pie that the Agawom diner.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.440]   If you're probably probably Massachusetts, guess of back break week.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   We're visiting Rowley, Massachusetts.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.040]   It's not by the Agawom diner.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]   Ask for bed.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   It's the pie place.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040]   Pie place.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.440]   I'm diner.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.880]   Thank you, Andy and I go have a great day.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   We'll talk to you next week.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   See you soon.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   Thanks guys.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   Hi, Andy.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.280]   And Gina, do you have a pick of the week for us?
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280]   I do.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   I do.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.080]   You actually may have picked this one already, but this is my latest Mac acquisition.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.640]   I was looking for an image editor, something I could do more than preview, but less than
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.000]   Photoshop on a programmer and not much of a designer, but I need to do sort of basic
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.760]   image stuff and I settled on after I tried a bunch of products, I settled on Pixelmator.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   I don't know.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.760]   Do you know Pixelmator?
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760]   Do you use it?
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.560]   What a great, what a great app.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.560]   It's fantastic.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.920]   It's 60 bucks and it's understandable.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.920]   I mean, I, an idiot like me can use it and yet it can do things, you know, support layers
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.640]   and can, and can do kind of just a little bit above basic image operations.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   And actually, I think you can do a lot more than I'm actually using it for.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   And I really like it.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.680]   It's really slick, really good looking, snow up and support.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680]   Some, yeah, really good stuff.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.320]   I only just scratched the surface, but like, you know, I started using it.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.640]   I just need to crop a few images for a couple of blog posts and I got it, you know, immediately.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.960]   I didn't have to watch any video tutorials or go through any boot camp training.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.160]   So yeah, I'm really digging it.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.800]   Yeah, we're big fans of the program and it's worth mentioning again because they just updated
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.520]   it and layers everything.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:14.440]   It's really, it's, it's coming on strong for a Photoshop and at the price boy.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.920]   It's fantastic.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   Yep.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.920]   $59.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.080]   Pixelmator P-I-X-E-L-M-A-T-O-R dot com.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.120]   Moiling, Moiling Man.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.640]   And I was very surprised to learn in our time discussing this before the show that you haven't
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.440]   done this one yet, but I really like this, I guess it's an application.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.200]   It runs, I see it in the menu bar, but it's called expand drive.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.680]   E-X-P-A-N-D-R-I-V-E, which I will Google right now.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.800]   And they are at oddly enough, expand drive dot com and really simple, so simple and yet
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800]   so powerful.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.920]   It, to anything that can be like any SSH connection where you can like SSH into somewhere, it makes
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.840]   an amountable drive on your desktop.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   Oh.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Oh, I like that.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.440]   Obviously, I still use, personally I still use and swear by transmit for pretty much everything
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:06.840]   involving FTP, some SSH stuff, but you know, you get, you have like a shared account somewhere.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.360]   It's really nice to have that built right into the finder and expand drive runs in such
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.080]   a way that you can have a sort of, you can enter your credentials and it'll bring that
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.120]   stuff automatically, automatically when you log in, you know.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.720]   It supports S3, I use jungle disk to create S3 backups.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.920]   You can create buckets, you can do it all.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.200]   What it doesn't do if memory serves, like gosh, I shouldn't say this because I don't
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   remember.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.920]   Last time, you know how S3 has all those dumb permissions problems, it's kind of dumb about
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   permissions.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.600]   I don't remember if they ever fix that to where you drop something without having to change
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.600]   permissions.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.600]   But yes, it does S3, there's lots of stuff.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.440]   It's, if you're, I mean, I couldn't go into too much detail about this because if you're
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.760]   not into it, this, it just looks like a folder.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.000]   But if you've ever gotten sick of having to go do SSH, blow for stuff, it's annoying,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.160]   a lot of all these hacks, this just makes, like, just a, just a thing in there and you
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.320]   drag stuff into it.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   It's fantastic.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.560]   I really like it a lot and expand drive and how much does it cost?
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.040]   I think it's not very costly.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.320]   It's, I'm looking for a price here.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.480]   It upgrades $20 bucks.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.720]   It's like a $40 bucks for a new user.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   I like it a lot, expand drive.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.040]   And because it's SFTP, it's secure, which is really nice.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.000]   You guys must use Dropbox a lot, right?
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   Merle, actually, tell me about it.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.400]   I haven't gotten into it as much.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.640]   We have the 50 gig drive.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   We use it all the time.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   But that's kind of not the same because that's a dedicated drive.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.120]   The nice thing about Dropbox, my gosh, I get to do 10 shows on Dropbox.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   It's amazing.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.760]   It's changed the way I do a lot of things.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.160]   The thing is nice about Dropbox, if you haven't used it and you're looking for the one bullet
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.920]   on why it's worth doing, is it's, I don't want to say fully integrated into the finder
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.600]   because I'm John Gruber type will tell me how it's not fully integrated in this one
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600]   way.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.720]   But in the same way you've got folders for music, movies, desktop, library, you now have
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.880]   a folder called Dropbox.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   Right.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.080]   It's technically, I think it's like a, it's like a symbolic link to a hidden folder.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.880]   I think it's using Web dev.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.200]   But it's, well, two things you need to know, it is integrated into the finder.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.120]   So when you drag something into it, it doesn't copy it.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.760]   It moves it, which is really disorienting to people at first.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.760]   Well, it's all.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.800]   It's good to remember because if you have a 50 gig drop box, you can have 50 gigs on
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800]   your drive.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.120]   There's any failing of Dropbox right now.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.920]   It's that you can kind of partition off and say, skip this directory.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.040]   You know, but basically anything under that tree gets synced to every computer you've
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.560]   got it running on immediately.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.960]   And the cloud quote unquote.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.160]   And what's sexy though is you've ever had that problem where you drag a bunch of files.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.000]   Let's say you have everything in your desktop, you throw it in a folder, you know, one HD
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.120]   movie can clog up the entire queue.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.640]   This starts with the smallest files.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.560]   So all your text files get, get synced first.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.800]   It's very smart that way.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:47.960]   I run the libraries for the application libraries for OmniFocus, Quicksilver, TextMate.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   All my TextMate bundles live on this.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.560]   So one, and then I do a symbolic link.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.760]   I do an Ln dash s to, you know, sync it all up.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.200]   And basically if you're a nerd, you're already gone.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.920]   But if you're still here, you know, that means that now my TextMate bundles are synced
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   everywhere.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.920]   OmniFocus everywhere.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.320]   Instead of using IDisk and Gina, you'll like this for people.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   It really is.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.720]   For people like us who use Windows and Mac, it supports both.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.720]   And you can use it.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720]   I like it.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.720]   Right.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.720]   So I can have it.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.000]   I have my drop boxes on all the machines.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Really.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.280]   You could share individual folders as well.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.840]   We use it for that's why we use it because we use it for podcasts.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.520]   So when we record a podcast for somebody, we create a show folder like we do East Mesa
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.480]   West with Roger Chang and Tom Merritt after Twitter every night.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.640]   I've shared just the one folder, not the whole drop box, but just the one folder with
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.320]   them so they can get their files.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   We just copy it over there.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.080]   That's what we do with, with you.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.080]   Nice to do.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080]   Sure.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.880]   And we just each throw our version of it into the folder.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.360]   Very cool.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   It's funny.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.200]   Ironic because here I am sitting with the two gurus of productivity, Kings of the calendar.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.680]   And I'm going to be doing the calendar pick of the week.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.200]   I bet I know what it is.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.200]   Yeah, busy.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.840]   And now 1.0 just came out today.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.400]   Now you introduced me to busy Mac Merlin because I used to use busy sync.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.960]   Which was their program to synchronize your iCal with Google.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.360]   You know, it's in a way it's kind of sad because Snow Leopard obviated a little bit
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.280]   of this because Snow Leopard has that built in syncing both on every page.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.360]   Just a little bit though.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   It's pretty janky.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   This is this is.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.920]   Well, you got to have different calendars for everything.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.240]   It's not pretty the way it does it ends.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.600]   They call they call this iCal pro and I think that's a pretty apt description.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.680]   And yet, but what it does is, well, I'm sorry.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.680]   You're bad.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680]   No, go ahead.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.680]   You're like I said, I'm sitting here with the.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.680]   You're just like waving.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   That guy.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:44.480]   There's functionality in this product called now contact and now up to date that I swore
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]   by.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.160]   Oh, do these guys come from now?
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   I don't know.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   But I mean, there's functionality.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   I missed that.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   You know, why is guys come on address book?
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.120]   I can't see everybody that works for one company.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   Really.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.040]   Is that really that hard to do like some kind of left join where I can see everybody that
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.280]   I owe my friends at Apple on one page, you know, sorry, different, different thing.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.880]   But this brings in a lot of the functionality that I'm now up to date.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.760]   Things like banners, all kinds of things that get you beyond.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.400]   I call feels like an application where they took this standard and they basically kind
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.560]   of put a semi pretty kind of candy colored skin on it.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560]   It's not a power.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.240]   I call is not a powerful application.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.840]   It's an application that doesn't break much.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.760]   It's an enterprise kind of application.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.040]   This adds more stuff into it about like how your life works.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.880]   So it is easier to do kind of fungible things where you can have like tasks for this day
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.680]   that show up in this area and I'm totally stealing your pick.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.680]   But I think it's a great app.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.040]   It's a little bit costly for most consumers, but I think it's worth it.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.440]   I think it's a beautiful app.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   That becomes my question.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   And how much more do you need?
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.760]   Only $30 bucks.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:48.720]   I mean, I count as 80% of this, but it's just the 20% that Busy Mac Busy Cal does are
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   something you need.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.480]   It's well worth the money.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:56.280]   You know, one of the other things it's very useful if you work in a business or an office,
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.720]   you can have multiple Busy Mac Busy Cals that are shared with each other.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.040]   So over the land.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.280]   So it's a land Cal as well.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.200]   And it syncs with Google Calendar.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:13.120]   So yeah, I think, you know, if it's certainly you can download it for free and try it.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.560]   It is $40 per computer.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   You buy multiple copies.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.160]   They have a discount for you.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.080]   And as I said, one point, oh, we just came out.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.360]   I've been doing the beta of it and it's now official.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.840]   Busy Cal from Busy Mac Busy Mac dot com.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.480]   My pick of the week.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.960]   Kids we, we're done.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.880]   The show is over.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.640]   Thank you so much, Gina Tappani for being here.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.080]   I hope we didn't scare you away.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   Not at all.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   Sorry.
