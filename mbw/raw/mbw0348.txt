[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly got a big panel here to talk about Apple's quarterly results.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600]   Of course, they just came out after the show last week.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.900]   We'll also kind of talk about rumors, especially in New Mac, but croak.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.600]   And how fast did WWDC sell out?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.800]   Really fast, faster than it took me to do this promo, actually.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400]   Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we let you know what's going on in
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.100]   Cupertino and a big panel today because probably Alex Lindsey, I'm guessing
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   Chad just surprised this and showed up, right?
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.600]   >> He let me know yesterday.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.400]   >> I told him.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.100]   >> Nice to have you.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.600]   >> I didn't show up.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.100]   It's good to be here.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.900]   >> Nice to have you.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.400]   Welcome.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.900]   Thank you.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.200]   >> Also here Renee Richie from Imor and Abute, somewhere in like a terrarium.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   >> We're on 75th, 70th, 45th Street in Manhattan.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.700]   >> Oh.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   >> Why?
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   >> We are doing, we sort of this thing called the smartphone round robin where
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   every week all the editors would switch phones for a week and try out the
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   different platforms.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.500]   >> And there's just so many good phones.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.700]   Now we decided to all get together in one place and just do it as one massive
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.500]   undertaking.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.200]   >> But what?
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.500]   Okay.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.900]   Now Imor is located.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.500]   Oh, I guess you're in Montreal, but Imor is everywhere.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   >> I'm in Montreal.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.700]   Kevin is in Winnipeg for some reason.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.900]   Phil's in Florida.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300]   Daniel's actually in Montreal.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.600]   That's sort of in a New York.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200]   >> So Manhattan is just a central point or else Daniel's the most powerful
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   person at Imor.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.900]   >> It both.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.800]   >> Anyway, great to have you Renee also.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.500]   Andy and I go here from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.700]   Good to see you.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> Actually, actually it looks like you got an idea for a new theme restaurant,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.500]   Ray, Richie's Margaritaville drill.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.000]   >> Actually, this was a reality TV.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We're using one floor of the building and previously three floors were some
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   for some fashion reality TV thing in this room was the Dexter room.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.500]   So it's got dragon wallpaper and bloody knives on the walls and that's
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.000]   very creepy.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   >> Is that project runway maybe?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.900]   >> I think it was a decoration.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200]   >> Are you at the Atlas apartments?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:37.140]   >> The Atlas
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.400]   Park and also because this is the hat that I didn't accidentally like leave.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   >> So when I was doing the vacuuming didn't realize that, wow,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.100]   now I can't wear that because at all this week because it's covered with cobwebs
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   and awfulness.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.400]   >> I'm just thrilled that a bus by stoning and has one.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.700]   That's wicked awesome.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.700]   >> A lot.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.900]   >> I guess it's these teams that didn't exist like 15 years ago that were
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.000]   slightly suspicious of.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> I agree.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Tampa Bay who?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.300]   >> And now ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Liverpool,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.000]   England, the Fab One, Mr. Don McAllister of ScreenCasts Online.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> Good morning.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.500]   >> Good morning where you are.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   >> Is it evening?
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   >> No.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.900]   >> It seems really sunny everywhere else and I'm stuck in this dingy,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.500]   it's beautifully sunny outside.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.100]   It's just that I haven't really got a window I can put behind me.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100]   I could really decamp to the conservatory.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100]   That might be better.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100]   >> You should look at that.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.100]   That's what Renee did.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100]   He decamped to the conservatory.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.100]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   >> I might do that next time.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100]   >> Renee Richie with the candlestick in the conservatory.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.100]   >> I did.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.200]   >> I really want an office like that.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   >> It's pretty.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.800]   I thought he was in a terrarium for a while.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   He looks like one of those lizards in a terrarium.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   >> It's a fake plot of prop plants.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.200]   No real plants were hurt in making this room.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800]   >> Still, I won't stop us from making Gilligan's Island jokes for the next hour and a half.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> Hey little buddy.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Okay, so I almost pulled the trigger and purchased a MacBook Pro.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.300]   >> And then you thought no.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.600]   >> And then I thought, wait a minute, WWDC is coming up in June.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   I know we're going to hear about iOS 7.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.200]   But it has well into, oh, it was the two together.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.400]   And then Intel announced this week that they will release the Kraken.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   AKA Haswell at Computex in Taiwan, which is early June, like June 3.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   And my brains got to thinking.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.800]   Perhaps it'll be a new MacBook Pro coming out.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.600]   Maybe even a Retina MacBook Air would not be sweet.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   >> That would be tasty.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.800]   >> What do you think, Mr. Renee Richie, rumor man?
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   >> You'll probably get new Macs because Apple is bound by Intel's roadmap for those.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   You'll get Haswell and then whatever the next one after Haswell is.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.400]   But the Retina MacBook Air still sound like they have battery life issues.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.200]   The same thing as the smaller iPad 5 and the Retina iPad Mini.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   You're just so constrained by battery technology still, that powering that display with Intel graphics requires a lot of power.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   >> And also somebody said that it would be have to be thicker for Retina.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> To fit more battery.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.900]   >> Oh, just for the battery.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.100]   Retina itself isn't a thick.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.700]   >> Sometimes because it requires more LED to light it because the pixels get denser.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.300]   >> Yeah, that's what they said.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.800]   The LEDs, I read something.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.300]   I didn't want to write.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.100]   >> But they have better LEDs now, which are the ones that are going into the new iPads.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.200]   And presumably they put those into the new MacBook Air as well.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.500]   And that thins things back down again.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.100]   And they're getting better display technologies as well.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.100]   >> Boy, I would.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.900]   Anyway, so I'm going to hold off.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.500]   I'm going to use this Windows computer.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.900]   If it kills me in a day and it really could.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   >> Probably will.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.500]   >> It probably will.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.600]   >> What happened to your Mac?
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.700]   >> I gave it, well, it was an old 11.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.900]   So I have a MacBook Retina at home like when you're sporting.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.000]   And I had an 11 I use in the studio, 11 inch air, which really was too small.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.700]   So I replaced that with a 13 inch air, but then my son is a senior in high school.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.900]   And so he got the 13 inch air.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.900]   So I'm using the 11 inch air.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.200]   Kind of tiny.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.500]   And I thought, oh no, I'll use Windows 8.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.300]   I'll show them.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.500]   >> How's that working for you?
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000]   >> I'll show them.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.300]   And gave the 11 inch air to a mentee of ours, seventh grader.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.300]   She needed a new computer.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.800]   And it was older.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   It's 11 inch air.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.600]   And I thought, I'll just get a new air.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.100]   And then now I have to wait, at least a month and a half, right?
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   What do we think?
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.600]   Well, if they announce, okay, so has well, typically what Apple does when there's a new
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.800]   Intel chip, is there often the first people to use it, right?
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Often yes.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> So we perhaps expect it's easiest for them to be the first one because they have more
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   control.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.200]   >> New Mac Pros, it'll be a good Mac Pro chip.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.600]   >> Well, WWDC would be the time to talk about Mac Pros.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.800]   I just don't think, I just still feel like they're going to, if they do a Mac Pro, I
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.600]   feel like they're going to announce it by putting it on the store without saying anything.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800]   >> No, it's here.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.400]   >> Mac Rumors says, and you'll forgive me, Renee, for quoting another rumor site.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.600]   >> No, he's one of the good ones.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   >> Yeah, I love Arnold.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   A number of rumors suggested Apple be looking to update its notebook line soon or at worldwide
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.080]   developers conference, which kicks off June 10th.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   Ming Chi Kuo, who we've heard from before, had laid out a roadmap in January, predicting
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.400]   the MacBook Air could see an update by late in the second quarter, that would be round
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.040]   then, with the MacBook Pro moving to an all-written lineup, I'd expect that early in the third
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:20.320]   quarter, Haswell comes out, Digitimes, anyway, the rumors are starting to pile up that we
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.720]   should probably see new Mac books.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   I think increasingly the Pro Mac is a laptop, isn't it?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   >> Yes.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.040]   >> I notice what you guys buy at Pixelcore.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.400]   >> We have a lot of retina maps.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.840]   >> But you also buy Minis and iMacs.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   >> So the Minis are the iMacs, we have a couple of, we don't have a ton of those.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.960]   The Minis are very utilitarian.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.680]   We throw a lot of Minis in a lot of different places.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.120]   >> That's something you recommend, but you can glue them to the back of a monitor.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.600]   >> Well, we've been doing some tests, for instance, with a whole multi-stream, like
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.400]   sending out like six different camera angles into the same stream and piling them together.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   And Mac Minis are great because you just stack them all up and kind of keep them combined.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.560]   So there's a bunch of advantages to those, from a utilitarian perspective, like putting
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.920]   them into server rooms to control things, that kind of thing.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.360]   So those are great that way, but we haven't bought iMacs for quite some time.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   >> And for your Pro work, is it a MacBook Pro sufficient?
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.520]   >> And this i7 in a Retina is pretty fast.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.440]   >> Yeah, yeah, they're very fast.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.840]   And we have some, there are some bugs that we've encountered with Photoshop and Omni-Graffle.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.400]   >> Do you have the graphics?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.520]   >> I just updated the new firmware update.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.840]   So I haven't seen it since then.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.480]   So it may have been corrected, but we had this kind of ongoing bug when we opened Photoshop
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.880]   or Omni-Graffle that we would eventually end up with tearing that was pretty cool looking.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:54.160]   And so that was the only issue we had, but otherwise it's very snappy.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.400]   >> Strikes me that we're due for a redesign.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   I mean, just kind of historically, they've been with this unibody aluminum for a long time.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   Do you think Andy, they'll be a redesign?
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.080]   What do you think is going to happen?
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.240]   >> Not on the airs, maybe on the pros, because that design is now three years old, four years old.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.840]   It's pretty perfect though, isn't it?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   >> Yeah, I mean, the problem that when you start talking about the difference between
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.320]   the pro line and the airline, the pro can't be that much of a design, of a style thing.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.720]   Even when they put together their all new, all wonderful top of the line, this is the best
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.960]   map we've ever made, retinomac MacBook Pro.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   It was the exact same design, only a little bit flatter.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.920]   And when you talk about all the stuff they have to do to a MacBook Pro in order to get
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.200]   all the requirements of the hardware they're putting inside there, it kind of competes with
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.280]   doing anything really fancy.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:58.640]   So, I mean, even Google, who's been putting so much of their engineering, so much of their
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.160]   think time into the design of their products, when they came up with their, this is our
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.200]   $1,500 ridiculously overpriced, but incredibly cool new Chromebook, it was the lid off of
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.520]   a hat box, it was like a square, it was a basic rectangular prism, the thing that you
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.080]   draw, you're doing your first five minutes of ever using a 3D CAD design program and they
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.400]   said, "Okay, done, perfect shape."
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.160]   So it's the monolith shape.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   So I don't know, I think they would have to try to do something to sort of throw in an
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   knuckle ball into there, but I can't imagine what they would do.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   But if they do anything radical, I think it would be more with the air than with the
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   pro.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.760]   It would be nice to see new Macs, it's just been so long.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.160]   There was always that comment from Tim Cook at the last earnings call that we wouldn't
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.440]   see new products until the fall or autumn, but I think that's really new product categories.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.800]   He said categories, that was the word I thought might actually.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.360]   He still sees some new Macs and WWDC is the ideal venue, especially for pro level kit,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.720]   you know, to actually release it then to the developers, that would be quite a big piece
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.200]   of QDOS to Apple, I think, to get them out then.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.640]   I have no history, no memory of history in my mind, because I'm an old man.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   Seems to me WWDC, they're going to announce, or they're going to show for the first time
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.840]   Johnny Ives new flat iOS 7, according to the rumors, right?
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.720]   Flatter, flatter, flat end.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:31.920]   For the reason I think of Wiley Coyote driving an ACME steamroller over the iOS 6 interface.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   That's a lot.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.000]   What's the history of that?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Do they do that?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.160]   Sometimes you see changes in iOS, changes in OS 10, and then we have in the past seen,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.200]   you know, announcements related to the iPhone, iPad, that kind of thing.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.360]   But generally when it goes with an OS update, like you need this new hardware to do this
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.880]   new thing, isn't that right?
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.800]   Again, my memory is failing.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.400]   No, last year was a retina MacBook Pro 15-inch.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.360]   A couple of years ago, Phil Schiller showed off the new enclosed battery MacBook.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.320]   They've had a history of doing MacBook Pros, especially at WWDC.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   My hopes are lifting.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.680]   I do think we need to, don't they?
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.680]   They really need to announce something at WWDC too.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.120]   It's been such a real drought, and they'll have so much to cover on iOS and OS 10, and
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.480]   just to cover the software without touching hardware.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.680]   That was my thinking.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   I think that if I'm going to guess on what's going to any hardware at WWDC, it would be
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.480]   the new MacBook Pro.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.920]   It's a natural fit for it.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.280]   It's not the sort of product where they can really do its own standalone event, and it's
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.520]   a device that's going to be of use to developers.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.080]   So if you want to get that reaction shot of 3,000 people cheering and whooping about,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.280]   "Yay, it's a metallic box with drive bays and dual channel bus."
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.880]   Oh, no, it's not sexy, but if they want to get that sort of meeting room, faith meeting
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.840]   sort of reaction, I think that's where they would want to do it.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.480]   Also we keep hearing a lot of different rumbles about how a new MacBook Pro is closer rather
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.280]   than farther away at this point.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.920]   It's too bad, because that's the thing that would give people on their feet as a new
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.240]   MacBook Pro, especially with that Thunderbolt WWDC.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.120]   I mean, the thing is that's not what I'm saying.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   Exactly what that is the one place.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.960]   But that's the thing that they probably will not do.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.360]   It seems really clear that they're not going to do that.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   I mean, it's a public event.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.160]   I noticed last time they released, I think it was either the line or mountain line, that
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:37.120]   they did a full demo of the new OS at WWDC, and then it was released later on in the awesome.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.680]   And then they redid basically the entire presentation again, because it was for a different audience.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.160]   So WWDC developers, and they would be the only people who would really be enthused about
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   the MacBook Pro.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.160]   And in some respects, it'd be sort of like payback time as well.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.360]   Developers have stuck with them for this long, and this is a gift to the developers.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.520]   Here you go, guys, there's a new development platform for you.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.840]   Yeah, it's a perfect fit, really.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.200]   My further developers have been pretty bitter about the whole thing, and it's hard to even
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   sell the tickets to WWDC.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   Only took them.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   Let's see.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.240]   It took four years ago, it took two weeks.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.600]   It took like 120 seconds.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   120.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   70.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   Really?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   70 seconds?
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   That's 70 seconds.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.520]   But it's meaningless because it's a very constrained supply.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.960]   I mean, there's only what?
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   How many tickets?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   5,000.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   5,000.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   And they pre-announced it this time.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   Yeah, people knew.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.240]   And, you know, there's no question that if you want to make money in software development,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.440]   the place to be is iOS apps, right?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Not only--
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   It's kind of a crapshoot.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.160]   I mean, it's a hit-driven industry.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.960]   There are a lot of people who don't make money, but those who do make a lot.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   WWDC didn't start selling out until they started-- until iOS was open up for development.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   And that's still where most of the money is being made.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.760]   And just as important as that, that's where people perceive the money as being made.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.880]   So this is where they figure that even people who wouldn't necessarily think to spend that
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.840]   much money on a conference ticket would think, well, I'm going to make all that money back
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.920]   once I write the next-- the thing that knocks Angry Birds off the top perch of the app store.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   Well, I think that from a developer perspective--
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's a short-term mom.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.120]   I need your credit card now.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.520]   Well, I think that a lot of the easy apps, obviously, have been written.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.000]   And so one of the reasons that WWDC is so important is people really have to figure
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.560]   out how to take full advantage of the OS and full advantage of every little bit and piece
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.720]   to create something imaginative that's going to be the next big thing.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   Absolutely.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   They're going to show up whatever the new features are.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.240]   They're going to want to get in the labs and find out about them because Apple's going
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.880]   to feature the apps that best show off iOS 7.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.120]   And you really want to get in the ground floor of that.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.080]   Well, there's also--
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   Sorry.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   Go ahead, Doc.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.800]   I was going to say that there's three things with WWDC.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   There's the information, the presentations that people go along to, the sessions.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   There's the labs that Renee mentioned.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.240]   And there's also the community as well.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.960]   And this year, they are sorting out the information because I believe they're going to be doing
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.160]   some-- if not live streaming, but certainly letting people have access to the presentations
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   during the conference.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.400]   I'm not sure how that's going to work, but that's one thing they're going to do.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.000]   The community is actually rallying ground.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   And there's lots of alternative WWDC events going on around-- in fact, around Moscone
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.840]   at the same time.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.720]   So people who haven't got tickets are actually still going to San Francisco and they're going
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.920]   to these alternative events to keep that community together.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.800]   But it's the labs really that people do miss out on if they can't get an official WWDC
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.360]   ticket because they have 1,000 Apple engineers at WWDC.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   And you can book time with them on a one-to-one basis.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.840]   So if you have problems with your applications or you need more information or you've got
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.720]   to book this through, they've been troubling you, you can actually find the person that
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.840]   actually deals with that part of the framework.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.040]   And I think for true developers, that's the real beauty of WWDC.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.240]   They can go in and meet up with those Apple engineers.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.880]   And that's something I think they need to sort out.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.920]   They are doing some tech talks I think later on in the year.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.600]   But that's the real goal for people who really want to go to WWDC.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   Absolutely.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.120]   That's exactly what I was going to say.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.560]   The more you talk to developers from the low level, even all the way up to the highest
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.160]   level developers out there, they can all give you multiple instances of which they had a
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.200]   problem that was just not getting solved, not getting solved.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.320]   They could not figure this out.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.160]   They couldn't get this thing to work until they got some time with an Apple engineer who
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.040]   were essentially telling them that, okay, well, the way we've documented this will work
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.720]   for 89 to 94% of all situations.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.840]   They're one of the 60% of developers who encountered that 6% alternative situation.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.480]   Here's a way to walk around it.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   So yeah, it's that face-to-face time.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.760]   Even if it's just like five minutes worth of very, very tightly controlled questions,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.840]   rather if you're walking in knowing that I'm spending this money so I can get an answer
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.000]   to this problem right here and to actually have an interaction to get that fixed, that's
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.920]   what people are spending that money for.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   But it's also the community aspect.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.200]   I mean, the thing that kind of bothered, to an extent, I mean, this is not a solvable
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   problem.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.400]   The thing selling out in two minutes and people will not be able to get the tickets.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.040]   I acknowledge it's an unsolvable problem, but the thing that gets me most worried about
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   it is that this stops becoming a show for the community of Apple developers and starts
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.560]   becoming a community event exclusively for those people who were able to bite, scratch
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   and fight and be there standing by at exactly one auto second past 1 p.m. when tickets were
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   going on sale with eight browser windows open and logged in with auto fill passwords all
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.520]   set to go.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.240]   It doesn't mean that those people who get in are unworthy by any means.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.720]   It just means that you're getting a specific type of attendee that you wouldn't be getting
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.080]   in 2007, 2008, 2009 when you didn't have to have, you didn't have to just be there at
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.720]   this one specific minute of the day, of the right week, of the right month of the year
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   in order to get those tickets.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.320]   So I wonder how that's going to affect things.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:15.440]   And the limit is really the ratio of engineers to developers.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.680]   That's what they're trying to maintain.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.440]   I mean, why do they only have 5,000 tickets?
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   Moscone O'Hanna, 40,000.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.760]   It's not a trade show where they just have an expo floor and be able to just wander around
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   visiting booths.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.920]   It really is enough engineers to do this one.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   Right.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   It's the ratio.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.520]   It is a place where it has to be a high value show.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.760]   And if Apple can't serve the needs of every attendee, then that's exactly that.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.880]   It's 5,000 because they can't serve 5,500 is the reason.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   Right.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   It's a shame.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.400]   You know, they do this in June, it'd be really great if there were like another Apple trade
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.440]   show say in January, six months before or after where you could have people get together,
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.960]   we're larger event and a larger venue and the community could meet.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960]   You could still have some education.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   It'd be really good.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   You could call it, I don't know, Mac.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   Mac world.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.360]   And just do an event.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.440]   This is the only scheduled thing all year for Apple, right?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.640]   Everything else is ad hoc.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   Yes.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.160]   No wonder it sells out in two minutes.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.680]   I'm telling you, this is kind of an artificial, they've artificially created this demand by
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.880]   constraining supply.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.680]   No, no, again, it really is.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.920]   If they had the ability to put on the show and serve 10,000 people, I know that they
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.080]   would, I believe that they would serve 10,000.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   We'll do it twice a year.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080]   I do.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   I do.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.480]   Well, then you've got your valuable engineers who are spending their time at this show for
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.120]   when we got here instead of trying to get iOS 12 out the door.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:46.200]   I think that I do like the announcements they're making saying that there is going to be WWDC,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.000]   but there's now going to be more tech talks sprinkled throughout the year.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.440]   This is something that they've done a lot in the past and they've done it fairly recently
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   too.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.520]   It's the ability to have, we're going to come to your town, we're going to get.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.080]   So we're going to come to your town.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.520]   So it's not a big expense to come in.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.880]   And also you're not going to be competing against someone who is in Portland, Oregon
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.720]   to the tech talk that's near Portland, Maine, that kind of takes a stress off.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.240]   And they send a lot of high level engineers to these shows too.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.920]   It's not as though they send, you know, Luigi the intern who just got hired two months ago
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.840]   to teach you all about how this, to operate this very technical issue, some of their high
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.160]   marquee engineers that go on these tech talks.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.720]   So and the evangelist team.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.320]   And if you went to WWDC, you can't go to the tech tours.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.040]   I try to make it a little fair that way.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.400]   When we come back, I do want to talk about other things they might announce at WWDC,
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   a little more about 10.9, because now Apple's on a yearly OS 10 release schedule.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.000]   So for sure, even though we've heard not much about 10.9, there will be something about
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   10.9, right?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.840]   iOS 7.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.800]   We also have not talked about the quarterly results.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.720]   It's been a week, but they wait till the very end of the Mac break weekly on a Tuesday,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   and then they do it.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   That's how they get us.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   That's how they get us.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.920]   Might all sense they do with stock market closing, all right.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.760]   But anyway, we will talk about their quarterly numbers and a lot more.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.000]   You get a great panel, Don McAllister from ScreenCasts, online, Andy and Naco from the
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.920]   Chicago Sun Times, Alex Lindsey from Points Unknown and thepixelcore.com.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.720]   And from imore.com now in Manhattan, Renee Ritchie.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.680]   He's a snowbird.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.840]   You know it's snowing in Winnipeg, by the way, you could tell.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.080]   I'm sure it is.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.480]   It's always snowing in Winnipeg.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.400]   Shortest summer in the Northern Hemisphere, I believe.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.120]   We are going to come back with more on Mac break weekly.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.680]   Our show today brought you by our good friends at audible.com.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.240]   Audible is something I live for.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.920]   In fact, I realized today I maybe have a problem because like I listened in the car this morning
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.360]   as I was driving Abby to her appointment, I then walked into work and I was listening
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.920]   on headphones to all of a sudden, I can't stop listening to audible.com.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.120]   I'm an audible fanatic.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.400]   I've got 100,000 books, some of the best books in the world.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   If you are not yet an audible user, I really want you to give it a try.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   In fact, we've got a deal that will give you your first book free.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.920]   But one of the things we like to do is give you some suggestions because 100,000 books
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   can be a little overwhelming.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   For instance, I'm listening.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.720]   I don't know who recommended it, but I'm loving it.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.760]   Joe Walton wrote a book called Among Others.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.600]   It's about a young Welsh girl.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.880]   It's not what I would normally listen to, but it happens.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.800]   She's a major fan of science fiction and she can do magic and see fairies.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   It's quite good.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.200]   It's her diary and I'm really enjoying it.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.120]   Also Catherine Kellgren reads it in a beautiful Welsh accent.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   That's just a beautiful book.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   That's what I'm listening to.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.640]   What are you listening to, Andy?
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.720]   You know how there's a sort of really hip.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.440]   You like to come up the really deep catalog hip thing that, "Well, see, this poet died
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.480]   midway between riding this epic poem that went on for 400 pages and over the next 10
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.440]   years, for the next 200 years, different poets would finish another stanza."
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.160]   And sometimes you just say, "Okay, screw it.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   Let's go obvious."
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:12.280]   David Sedaris came out with a new book last week called Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.960]   There should almost be a checkbox when you sign up for Audible saying, "Just whenever
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.640]   Sedaris comes out with a new book, just give it to me.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.200]   Take my own, my credits, just give it to me."
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.320]   Because it's the usual series of little short slice of life observations.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.880]   I just got it a few days ago.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.920]   I've been listening to it.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.600]   Some of them are studio recordings.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.960]   Some of them are live recordings.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.280]   And it's all read by David Sedaris.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.600]   It's a good alternative to some of the like 12 to 18 to 22 hour novels.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.960]   Sometimes you get unabridged where you really are in it for four or five, six days of listening
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.200]   before you get to the end of it.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.160]   This is a series of essays.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.560]   And so each one will take you to one commute kind of forward and back.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   And I mean, it's David Sedaris.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.080]   It's one of those rare name brands in an essayist where if his name's on it, I'm interested
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   in it.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.000]   Actually, he's probably at that list where if his name's on it, I don't even care.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I'm just going to buy it.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I love David Sedaris.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   Now, there's a couple of books, but you really have a lot to choose from.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.640]   You want to get one free.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640]   You can.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   Here's the deal.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   You're going to sign up for the gold account.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.520]   But your first month's free, your first book's free cancel anytime in the first 30 days.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   You pay nothing.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.080]   The book will be yours to keep no matter what.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.440]   However, I think you're going to want to keep going because once you start, I just should
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.080]   warn you, once you start listening, you can never stop.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.880]   So go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.280]   That's the place to go for this audible.com/macbreak.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Start listening today.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.680]   Audible books are wonderful.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:51.240]   They play on everything, of course, early on, audible supported the iPod.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.800]   So you just used iTunes to sync it up and so forth.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.840]   But now Audible, gosh, they have a great app for iOS and Android also if you want.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   Windows phone, Windows A.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.400]   And by the way, as someone who spent a lot of time using iTunes and downloading Audible
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   books via iTunes, you really want to use the Audible app because it doesn't convert over.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.160]   Like, if you decide you don't want to use iTunes anymore, you want to use.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.240]   Yeah, you kind of live in iTunes.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.280]   And so even though it is an Audible solution, I haven't found a way to convert those.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.760]   And then when you switch things over, it's just much, much easier if you want it available
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.920]   on all your machines to just get the Audible app and buy straight.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Well, you're whole life.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   So I have like 500 books on my library because I've been listening since 2000.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   That whole library is always available.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   I can just click a book down.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.120]   If you did it through the Audible in the app, which is great.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.960]   I don't need to sync to iTunes or anything.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   You have to agree with this.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   You have to agree with this.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.000]   It's always through the app, but if you make the purchase through the Audible store on
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.280]   any platform, even online, it's always when you purchase it as an iTunes download that
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.960]   your central Audible account doesn't understand that you bought this already.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   And so, yeah.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   Love it.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.520]   It's very sad if you bought 20 or 30 books on iTunes.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   No, no.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.120]   Oh, you're saying don't buy it through the iTunes store.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   Right.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   I agree.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   Do it on the Audible.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   No, you got to do it on the Audible.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   On the Audible.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   And download the iTunes, you still haven't your library.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.000]   Because that's how I did it for the first five, six years.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.840]   You want to buy it through the Audible website or whatever.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.760]   But buying it in iTunes is not the same.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   I haven't found a way to get it.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   No.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   They did a deal with Apple.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   And it's a weird deal.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   It's a weird deal.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   It's not.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   So, that's a good tip.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   I thought you meant use the app.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   No, no, no.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   But what you're saying is just don't use iTunes.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Don't buy them in the iTunes.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   Don't buy them in iTunes, which is easy because once you get your iTunes account and
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   you're like, it's easy.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   I can just do it quickly.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   I don't have to deal with it.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   I don't have to deal with it.

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   I don't have to deal with it.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   Andy can probably explain it better than
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   you can find it for a long time because
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   Finder was so far behind.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   It's plumbing.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   It's an app that is so built in that it's just plumbing at this point.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   I'd love to see the Finder removed as the central concierge of the entire macOS experience.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   It really is a very 1998 to 2002 sort of thing.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   The feature that I've heard ever in the same 9-5 article as when it did,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   the feature that has perk my ears up every time I've heard about it for the past two and
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   a half years is finally getting tags in the Finder because we really just need better organization
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   features.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   We still primarily have a Finder that's basically a graphical front end to Unix directory structure.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   When we can do so much more, spotlight should be moved away from the upper right hand corner
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   and move more to the center of the experience where if you want to file, you describe the
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   file you're looking for and it will bring it to you as opposed to having to drill down
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   and then up again.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   That wouldn't be so bad having to drill down and up again if we had an app that, a Finder
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   app that made it easy to navigate that way.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   Ideally the file browser we saw in Jurassic Park, you know, this is Unix.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   I know this and just putting your goggles and fly through your file structure.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   Is that going to be a 10.9 or we're deferring that to 10.10 I think?
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   Yes.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   That's the Finder app.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   You look at what's being done elsewhere and it just looks a little bit stodgy.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   I'm still amazed at how much time I find futzing around with files.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   I don't want all the files to be sandboxed completely like the R&IOS.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   I do want to have exposure to actual discrete files I can move from one place to another
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   because I own these files and I own this Mac.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   If I want to move this file from here to there, I should be able to move this file from here
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   because I remember I paid you money for this piece of software.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   You didn't just give this to me for free Apple.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   But yeah, I mean the Finder really needs a lot of updating.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   Meanwhile, we know iOS 7 will be talked about and the new flatter system will, according
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   to 9 to 5 Mac, lose all signs of gloss, shine and everybody's favorite word, skewomorphism.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   I don't mind that.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   We were a number one of us knew how to spell that word.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   Yeah, now we all can't bear it.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   It was a geeky design term and now it's a madly misunderstood mainstream term.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   So was it going to look like Windows Phone 8?
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   No.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   Because really I got it.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   That would be a disaster.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   No, I got to come in Microsoft.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   I think that's a fresh new take on design.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   It's sort of.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   They had very little choice.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   It's sort of like iOS 1 and iOS 2 couldn't do compositing, couldn't do masking.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   It couldn't push pixels around.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   That's why there was no wallpaper because it couldn't handle compositing wallpaper over icons.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   But then their graphics engine got better and suddenly they could start doing these things.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   Windows Phone and Android were starting at the same point iOS did and they just literally
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   could not do anything more than flat, solid, square corners and get any performance at all
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   out of it.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   But because they were constrained and it looked different, they sort of did the best thing
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   that they possibly could have made a design language that really suited those limitations.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   And it became fashionable.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   So we already saw a little preview with the change in the podcasting app, right?
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.600]   They got rid of the real to real.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   Which is handy bought it.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   Kind of sad, but I like the real to real.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   Andy has it.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   It's a ReVox.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   The Ampex model 351.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   I miss you.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   I miss you.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   It actually looks like a ReVox.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   And some person write us a complaining saying that they used to look at the real to real
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   while they were listening to podcasts because it was just enough to hold their interest.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   But not enough to describe.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   That's what we need.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   We have it.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   I'm going to build a new podcasting app.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   It's called Reel to Real.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   It's a place just jingle car keys in front of the screen.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   It's a market opportunity.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   Listen.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   Listen.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   You are getting sleepy.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Alex, we're never going to make a podcasting situation.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Can we tell anything from the WWDC logo?
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   No.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   That's about the ugliest piece of crap I've ever seen.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   I've got to say, I'm not a designer, but it's all ugly.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Olympic logo.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   It's like it does.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   It looks like Olympics always have the worst logo and mascot design because it's done by
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   committee.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   This looks like that.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   No Scott forced all.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   It's a colored eye which.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   That's what it is.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   It's an eye which.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   Multi-colored eye watch.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   All the different eye watch faces.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   Oh, I thought you said sandwich like it's got green salami.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Ooh, I didn't think of that.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   Jello sandwich.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   I'm interested.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   I'm interested.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   You think it's a watch?
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   That's interesting.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   Maybe it's a watch.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   I mean, WWDC would be a good time to talk about what you could do with a watch and how to develop for it.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   Design is very, uh, uh, uh, style driven.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Of course, it's designed.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   It's practically the same word.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   And so, uh, you know, flats that style now in five years will look back and say, God flat was horrible.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   How did we ever live with flat?
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   It was so great when everything was skewn morph.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   Well, I don't know if we'll do that.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   Uh, but you know what I'm really sick of is the jelly, uh, three dimensional fake bulge,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   rounded corners thing that Apple, you know, with, uh, with Aqua kind of introduced.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   I think we're ready to get rid of that.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   And I finally got that into an action script that would just do it automatically.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   You know, give a little square and just push the button.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   We call it blob it.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   Blobify.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   Blobify.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   Um, I'm sorry.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   I hear a lot of rumors of like extra functionality.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   And I mean, that sounds like the sort of thing that Apple would hold very close to its chest.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   Uh, and everybody can sort of guess that it's going to be a style of redesign.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   I'll clever.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   I'll be, I'll be more interested to hear what does it do that it doesn't, that iOS six doesn't do already.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   I mean, I, I think we talked about this few weeks ago.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   We did piece, I wrote a couple of pieces about it about here are things that I really want
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   iOS seven to do.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   Uh, but it's, it's Apple's kind of starting to feel a little bit of pressure right now.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Yeah, because it's, you know, when you have a mature product that pretty much is perfect,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   it's very difficult to come up with a new thing that doesn't screw it up.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Um, so Mike Elgin, who says the eye and iPhone in 2013 is going to stand for identity.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   This is because of the rumor.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   I don't know if it's founded or unfounded that there will be a fingerprint reader in the
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   new iPhone.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   I would like that.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   Uh, it worked.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Uh, a working, well, remember they bought authentic, which is a fingerprint reading company.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   Actually, a fingerprint reading company that is kind of notorious for having a major security
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   flaw since fixed, uh, that allowed anybody to log in.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   Turned out it would anybody's fingerprint works.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   It's secure the database, but, uh, that's done.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   That's fixed.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   Um, so, okay.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   And then so Elgin says, okay, let's say we have a device that is, that has perfect identity
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   capability and really support, you know, really well supported, trustworthy identity.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   And then we have in it, maybe an NFC chip, maybe the, uh, the wallet becomes suddenly,
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   the passport suddenly becomes, uh, c- because they've never put credit cards or bank accounts
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   in there, but now you've got identity and you've got protection.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   Maybe you do that.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   And suddenly this is your, this is, this is really much more functional.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   Is that?
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   What do you think of that rumor?
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   I mean, that's what people have been talking about since past book was introduced.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   Past book was built in such a way that yes, it uses QR codes now that could very easily
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.600]   replace those with NFC and there is the authentic purchase and, you know, who knows how long
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   it takes before Apple really has a fingerprint scanner in the home button.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   That's not interrupted by the white paint that they're using, but you can see things moving
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   in that direction, whether it's, you know, 2013, 2014, uh, plan.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   And this authentication becomes, though.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   The authentication becomes a bigger, bigger deal because it's, it's one of the things that
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   you put more and more on your phone.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   I mean, I know that I've misplaced my phone and suddenly realized, oh my goodness, I've
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   got, you know, a lot of data there.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   I'll go even farther though, because I've talked a little bit with people who are talking about
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   the future of money and stuff.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   And it turns out, you know, from Visa to, to past book to everything, the whole problem of
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   money is identity, is the ability, I owe you something.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   So the real challenge is to prove it's you and it's me.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   And then it's easy for us to exchange the bits that say I give you money.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   The real challenge is identity.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.200]   So if Apple can solve identity in a way that's acceptable, that's widely adopted, that's
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.600]   another problem because it is not monopoly.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   Well, in some ways it's terrible.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   I mean, it's a, it's not the easiest thing in the world, even with a great keyboard to enter
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   a password in mobile under pressure while you're moving around.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   So it's a complex one.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   I mean, the entering hash is what we have pins.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   But pins are four digits, that's easy to crack.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.600]   But a pin plus a, you know, pin.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   A password or a fingerprint.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   A fingerprint.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   It becomes pretty, pretty secure pretty quickly.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   You know, the, but I think that it is, the timing is really good for Apple because, you
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   know, Samsung has, you know, put out their big, their big releases.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   Right.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   Now's the time, you know, the Android market is hard because it's fragmented.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   So you have a lot of people, you'd have to get all these.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   The big ones are out.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   Nokia, HTC, Samsung.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:32.920]   The one hanging, you know, shoe that yet to be dropped is what Google will do with the
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.120]   Nexus X or what Motorola Google will do with perhaps the next generation.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.600]   It's possible that Google has something really amazing waiting for the X phone.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   The Note 3, I think.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   The Note 3 as well is pending.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.000]   But the problem for them is that, is that because the Android, the advantage that Apple
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.600]   has is they, they do it and they standardize across everything very, very quickly.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.800]   You know, it's, it's a, even though they're, you know, there's a lot more Android.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.920]   There's, you know, being sold, they're not of one, of one unit.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   So Apple makes another one design that has all those pieces and it allows them to standardize,
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.320]   which makes it much easier to get it adopted, I think.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.880]   As of yesterday, there's probably more Google now users on iOS than there are in Android.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.040]   Yeah, we could talk, we'll talk about that.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.720]   I'm sure a little bit later.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.760]   But part of the, part of the difficulty is still going to be that you can have the most
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:24.000]   wonderful technology for identity protection and, and e-commerce on, on a mobile device.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.280]   It still has to talk to a point of sale computer that is very likely to be running Windows
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   XP.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.040]   So, I mean, one, one, one of the reasons why QR codes work so well is that all you need
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:39.200]   to do is, it was Windows XP release in the time when, when launch tech had their little
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.880]   eyeball cam, yes, good.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.760]   And we know how to, we know how to interface this, this operating system with an eyeball
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   cam.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.080]   It's, it's, it's, it's a non, it's a non-linear problem.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.040]   But it'll probably be staggered the way location services, Apple have identity services and
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.760]   it will default to QR codes if that's all that's available and then upgrade to authentication
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.920]   and FC and other things as they go online.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:03.160]   So they're usually pretty good about building robust layers for their new API stacks.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.560]   Motorola has apparently already done this.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   Remember the atrix?
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.480]   Which is an Android device, but that had a fingerprint reader on it.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.360]   It was, it was an interesting place too.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.600]   As I remember, was it, was it the on off button?
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   It was not where you would see it.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.040]   It was on the edge.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   It was on the edge.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.520]   And see, and that isn't, that's another problem.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.640]   My authentication has to work 100% of the time.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.680]   If, if the, the good thing about a pin code is that if you screw up typing it in, that's
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.800]   your, you, you perceive it as your fault that, okay, you forgot what your, what your pin was.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.520]   But still if you type, if you tap the one button and then the two button and then the
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   three button and then the four button, that is not my pin number.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.240]   The keyboard actually works.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   Right there.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:55.560]   But if you have like a, a biometric reader and you don't know why it's not working and
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.400]   it keeps telling you that, nope, that's not your finger.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   Yes, it is my finger.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.360]   But I think that I think that the backstop to that is going to be, it's just ease of use.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.120]   I think the backstop is a longer password.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.600]   Like if you, if you really set something up, like I want to protect my, you know, banking
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.840]   transactions or something with that, then you, then you would have a, you would basically
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.320]   have to type in a much larger hash to get through it.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   If you decide to, I'm going to guess that it's going to be a layer of security that you decide
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.640]   you want to do or not.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   Right.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   And there's got to be something longer back.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.480]   By the way, I tell you that, if you have enough money in Bank of America and I don't,
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.000]   anyone's asking, if you have enough money, a large enough account, you actually get an
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.160]   iris scanner, they send one to you.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.840]   You know, I don't know if that's true because I have a lot of money in Bank of America.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   How much you would have to have millions?
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   Millions.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   Like millions.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   Millions.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.840]   Evidently, evidently.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.320]   And then what do you have in your house?
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.320]   Yes.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.080]   They send one to your house and then, and then you use it to log in and look at your account
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.960]   from your house at your house or your office.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.760]   You know, FDIC insurance limits really discourage you from having a million dollars and you're
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.280]   checking account.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.440]   So you use iris scanner for your bank account or for first one Hollywood movies that you
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.880]   pay $500 a pop for.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.800]   Yeah, that's the Sony America.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.400]   So yeah, America, God bless it.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   That's a great solution.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.920]   Because that means that now the bad guys would have to like pay the 12 year old kid who
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.960]   lives in the house next door to sniff your Wi-Fi network to get access.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   That's the question.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.360]   What if your password gets compromised?
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   You take you change your password.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.880]   If your thumbprint gets compromised, it's hard to change your thumbprint.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.280]   You can't compromise a thumbprint.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   You guys are nuts.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.400]   What are you going to you've been watching too many total recall movies?
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.120]   These things you can't cut off somebody's thumb and use it.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.880]   You can't use Play-Doh because it has it has an infrared scanner can tell if it's live
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   or not.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   Mr.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.120]   I think they've got it down.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.200]   Nick Bilton was not with a million from Bloomberg this week was here for Twit.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.120]   And Bloomberg uses for their Bloomberg terminals a credit card thing with a static.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.440]   You don't swipe at a static.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.960]   That's not Bloomberg, not just the employees.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.120]   That's anybody who has a terminal has a terminal.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.760]   And it was and he's I've asked him and he said it was very reliable.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.920]   The only time it doesn't work great is if he's like just out of the shower and it's humid
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   and his fingers moist.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.200]   So he goes like this and it works fine.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   It's reliable.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   I think the technology's been solved.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.080]   I think we've seen a lot of crappy.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   Well, humor great.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.920]   How's it going to work on a mobile device?
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.440]   I mean, what's surfers are going to put it in so that it's a place where you will not
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.080]   drop this phone on the concrete because you have to hold it this way while putting your
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   thumb on this phone.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   Apple doesn't care if you use a robot.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   They'll put it in the home.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.280]   Yeah, I seems like they're in turn.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.560]   So Andy, you're very skeptical.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   It's obvious.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   You don't think this is going to happen.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.800]   Well, I'm not skeptical.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   I mean, it's a non-trivial problem.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.920]   It isn't like total recall.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   You don't just put a backlit illuminated green dot in the middle of a device that says place
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.080]   thumb here.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.920]   Stand still for retina scan because I've used a lot of you.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:00.440]   I've tried a lot of these different biometric input devices and I've never found one that
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.520]   absolutely is 100% reliable or rather, excuse me, is reliable enough for an Apple consumer
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.440]   device level of use.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.320]   The usually part of the design of this thing is built upon the fact that everybody who uses
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.720]   this, they are willing to suffer a little tiny bit for the extra security that they
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.800]   think they absolutely need for access to their devices or because their bosses are making
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   them do it.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:28.000]   If this is a your basic go to the mall with $200 come out with a brand new phone type device,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.240]   it's not going to be something that people are going to put up with for very long.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.880]   It's going to be a Samsung feature, something that they play with the first two or three
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.440]   days and then deactivate because it comes to two.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.880]   The other thing is that we're assuming that the problem that needs to be solved is to
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:50.600]   have real biometric security built in as opposed to understanding behaviorally who this person
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   is.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.840]   Understanding this person wants to spend 99 cents at the iTunes store or the Amazon MP3
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.040]   store for a track.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.520]   Okay, this is something that this person often does.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.840]   Gee, this person wants to buy 50 X boxes.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.360]   This is something that he never does.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   This is then there's a lot of security that's built into bank cards is based on what is
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   understanding exactly what kind of transaction history someone is going to be doing.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.880]   I don't think it's necessarily an obvious thing that they would put a fingerprint scanner
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.960]   or a better facial recognition camera scanner or anything like that on a device.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.080]   I think it would be a little bit more subtle than that.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.720]   Just to close it off and Renee has the right point there.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.360]   Apple has done the smart thing and created a system for payments that it doesn't care
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.760]   what the method of transmission is.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   It's just a standardized clearing house for everything you've bought and way to close
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   that deal.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.320]   If Apple did decide to, we're going to have a new phone that has two Mickey Mouse ears
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.080]   bulging off the sides of it.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.520]   You have to hold it like this and sort of pull it on one side in order to get the thing
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.400]   to activate that easily be able to expand what they have.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.640]   I just don't think it's necessarily obvious that they would put a fingerprint scanner
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.120]   on even on the home button.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.080]   This is the button that you tap how many times of the course of a day.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.680]   So are you going to be able to put all those electronics inside this one tiny little patch
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.520]   and have it be completely reliable?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.680]   I just think it's a non-trivial problem.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.200]   Well, certainly if it can't be done perfectly Apple won't do it.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   As you say, it's a serious eye cloud.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.360]   Oh, yeah, wait a minute.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:32.760]   All I know is the company that solves this is going to be big bucks in the next decade.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.720]   This is a huge opportunity for somebody.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.680]   It's the easiest for Apple to solve because they're selling a premium item that they
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.840]   can spend more money on.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.160]   It's easier for Apple to do this than anyone else.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.760]   It's hard to do, very hard to do, but it's easier for them and that does give them, I
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.640]   mean, it's not just an e-commerce.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.800]   It's in, for instance, boating.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   You know, those kind of things.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   No, I tell you it's--
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.440]   Once you start to get to that, once you get to the identity sort of money, it's big.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.240]   And I think Mike's point is well taken and I take your point well to Andy, which is
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.480]   it's not easily solved.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   Exactly why Apple should think about doing it.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.200]   I do make the point that if you could solve it and I don't know if they have the technology
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.520]   or not, it would be worth doing.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.880]   And this is a kind of big thing that a Google or an Apple is almost certainly going to tackle
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   at some point.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   That's the point that's true.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.320]   I'll do it this way and then I'll do it afterwards.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   But that's true.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.720]   But this is also a thing like networking.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:27.800]   Apple as powerful and as influential as they are, they can't create a new networking standard
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   and expect that everybody's just going to-- a proprietary networking standard and expect
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.280]   that everybody's going to go use it.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:37.360]   So if they had a transaction system, if they had an identity lock system, they would have
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.720]   to be something that could go on Android, could go on Windows, could go on Blackberry,
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.520]   could go on anything.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.440]   Because at best, if they did a great job of it on Apple devices, it would sell-- it would
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.320]   work really, really great for consumers in the United States.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:58.560]   But as you go outward where there isn't quite so much penetration of Apple in consumers,
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560]   it's a difficult thing.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:05.240]   Again, we saw-- we're still trying to get a message on other devices or-- excuse me--
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.120]   this supposedly open standard on other devices.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.680]   I know there are a lot of things that kind of trip them up that Apple didn't foresee.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.840]   Things that were outside of their control.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:19.520]   But it shows you the problem of Apple trying to create a system that works great on a piece
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.600]   of hardware where they control every aspect of the hardware and trying to create a system
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.400]   that works great no matter what hardware it's running on, no matter what software is trying
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:32.640]   to interface with it, and no matter what really weird hotel, what backwater town is
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.960]   on a computer system that's still running Windows 3.01, it's trying to connect to.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   But I don't know if it has to work on everything.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   I think that the issue is--
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.400]   for instance, for me, if it's good, I was going to say, I'd buy the phone if it worked
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   on United.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:56.560]   And it would make sense for Apple to take a little bite out of this.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.960]   I got to point out, they spent $356 million on authentic.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.680]   They admittedly Apple has more money than God.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.440]   But still, $356 million is not chicken feed.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   You don't buy that company.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   You can buy a good house with that.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.320]   You don't buy a company like that unless you have plans for it, or do you?
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   I'm not Apple.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.760]   Maybe Larry Ellison wanted it.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.040]   He just wanted to screw up the realism.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.040]   First birthday.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.560]   I think they were talking to Samsung.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.360]   So it could have been a preemptive defensive strike.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.600]   And authentic, apparently, has a lot of patents in this area.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.800]   So it may be that there was no-- it could have been purely defensive.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.360]   It's true.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.360]   It's true.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.040]   Speak, by the way, speaking of Bloomberg, they just came out with a story a minute
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:45.240]   ago that Russian billionaire, if you got $19 billion in your pocket--
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   Spent $100 million on Apple.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   Spent $100 million on Apple.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.200]   Well, lowest price is 2011.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   Why not?
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.920]   From the bone.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.320]   He probably said this.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.720]   I'll throw you a bun.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.800]   I believe in future of company-- he sounds like Boris Badenov because I'm doing a bad
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   board.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   I believe in future of Natasha in Squettle.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.600]   No, I believe in future of company even after Steve Jobs.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.960]   And company lost $100 billion of its market value, good time to buy its shares as the
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.520]   capitalization should rebound.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.760]   Suddenly the Russians are experts at capital.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.520]   They have a lot of money.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.680]   That's how you get an expert.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   You have a lot of it.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   A lot of practice.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.880]   He is Russian's richest man.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.320]   Don't ask how I make money.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.200]   He's an amazing, complex story.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   Ouch.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.560]   Ouch.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.520]   So we'll take a break.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.520]   Come back.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   I'm just being silly.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.480]   Uh, Tim Cook.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   Coffee chat with Tim Cook.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.800]   Is it the auction still going on?
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.480]   Let's get the-- we're going to go to the torque board and find out how much people have
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   bid so far.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.640]   Because rumor is Leo.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.440]   Leo is going to do it.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   [SINGING]
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.000]   If you're a Russian billionaire with 100--
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   It's live in Ivan.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.600]   We'll check the-- we'll check the torque board and find out how much Tim Cook's coffee
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.160]   is worth in just a moment.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.480]   But first, a word from Smile Software.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.000]   The new PDF pen 6 just shipped for Mac and Tash.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.840]   You can get it at the Mac App Store.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:21.800]   PDF pen, as you probably know, is that super great, all powerful, all-- all-- all knowing
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.720]   powerful, all-purpose PDF editing tool from Smile.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.640]   And now, this is-- you don't have-- this-- actually, I love this because I don't have
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.400]   to buy Microsoft Office.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.120]   Now with version 6, you can export your PDFs to Microsoft Word format and send it to that
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   nitwit who still wants--
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   All those luddites.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.200]   Yeah, those ludd-- you get that to be a DocX format.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.560]   I don't understand PDF.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   You can add signatures.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:51.040]   Make-- in fact, I love adding signatures because I have a little library in PDF pen.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.880]   And it's like a stamp.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.720]   I have signatures and initials for everybody in my family.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   Well, it's funny because I get--
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   I can find--
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   I can find these documents for anybody.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.720]   I get these docs.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.920]   I get the docs and they say, you know, please print out, sign facts back to us.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   And I think to myself, no.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.480]   No, not really.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.200]   I have PDF pen and now PDF pen Pro 6.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.840]   Oh, we love it.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.640]   David Sparks did a nice little video you could find it on the Smile Software page.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.800]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.480]   They even have a free demo waiting, so you don't have to take our word for it.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.040]   The free demo is not on the app store for obvious reasons.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.560]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   You could fill out forms, which is really nice.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   You could correct typos in PDFs.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.560]   It's really powerful.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.560]   You can feature them.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.720]   If you've seen the automatic form filler on the Pro version, basically, you know, as
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.880]   I like to say, when you get a form to fill in, sometimes it's a bit tricky to draw the
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   boxes in.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   Yeah, it's a pain.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.320]   Well, now you can just click a button and it will analyze the PDF and actually put text
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   boxes in for you.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.840]   And with this little small boxes, it will put radio buttons in and check boxes in automatically.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:57.840]   Oh.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.840]   So it makes it even easier to do that.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.840]   I wish I'd had that about three months ago.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.400]   And Acrobat has that, but it's for $800 or whatever.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   No, this is great.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   This is great.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.520]   This is pen and PDF pen pro version six just came out.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.760]   Get your demo.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.360]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.040]   Let's all go there now and break their site.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.040]   Everybody go.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   I know doing that.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.000]   I especially love doing it with advertisers because then I say you just didn't appreciate
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.160]   the power of MacBreak.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   Wiggly, did you?
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.960]   It's not actually they know.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.600]   But I bet you if we all went there right now and downloaded a copy, we could break
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   them.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   SmileSoftware.com/MacBreak.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.800]   That's so mean to me.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   OCR scan documents, fill out forms, make changes, fix typos, resize, delete images at text,
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.160]   images and signatures.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.400]   A nice new interface and improved tools.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.120]   You're really going to like it.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.320]   PDF pen six is out.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:53.440]   And smileSoftware.com/MacBreak.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   SmileSoftware.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.040]   You just got the portholes.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   That sounds nasty.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   Ew.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.520]   So what is the current price?
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:09.920]   So we have a $600,000 and now they're anonymizing the names of the people who are bidding.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.640]   They didn't used to do that unless that's his name.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.960]   S, star, star, star, star.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.960]   You know what?
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   I bet that's his name.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.440]   S, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, and now see SMS, S, Mosin.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.880]   Now it says winning but he hasn't won yet.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.320]   There's two more weeks.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.320]   It's for charity buzz.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   What?
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.520]   And what is Tim Cook's charity today, Chaddington?
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.520]   What is it?
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.520]   What are we bidding?
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.520]   What is we doing?
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.520]   Let me check.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:42.600]   Anyway, and you have to bid at least $600 and $5,000.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:49.080]   So this benefits the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   Awesome.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   Awesome.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   Look at that.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.680]   That has the easiest $600,000 ever.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   That's amazing.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   Incredible.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   That's more than Warren Buffett was getting.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.680]   Really?
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.720]   Like the largest amount ever.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.120]   Half a million.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   Over half a million.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.760]   I mean, you know what I'm saying for lunch too.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.920]   Oh, hey, they didn't say that.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.360]   Does Tim buy the coffee?
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   Yes.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   No, it's not lunch.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   It's coffee.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   That'd be a venti.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.920]   But it's on the Koopa Keto campus.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:25.440]   You got to imagine that nobody, you got to imagine that whoever's buying this is buying
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.000]   a fraction of Tim Cook's attention for whoever long it takes to drink that coffee.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.480]   That's just how valuable Tim Cook's attention is.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   Nobody.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.320]   And you look at the other things that are being auctioned off, like celebrity encounters
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.400]   and like even Alec Baldwin.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.640]   Okay, that's $1,200.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   No, come on.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   I pay with somebody like $500.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.840]   I pay more than that.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.640]   I draw something with Alec Baldwin for talking about.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   I like Alec Baldwin.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.200]   I pay to meet him.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.160]   I think that didn't used to be the high bid.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.720]   I'm trying to look it up, but I think that the high bid used to be $605,000.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.240]   I think the high bid got invalidated for some reason.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.520]   Yeah, it's saying on the site that then your next bid, if you're to bid, you need to bid
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.640]   at least another $5,000.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.160]   So that's so that may have been invalid.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.760]   There's some funny legal terms.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.280]   So you can actually bring two people.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.440]   Two people experience will be 30 minutes to one hour.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.120]   Cannot be resold a re-oxygen expires one year from the close of auction.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.720]   To be scheduled to mutually agree upon day travel accommodations on included winning
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.520]   bidder and guess subject to security screening, we spread all winning bidders in their guests
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.120]   to conduct themselves appropriately when attending an experience.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.720]   One at charity buzz, but like managers and respect for the generous donor to hear it
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.560]   so any use or parameters are a must.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   So that's generic.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:40.120]   Dude, you're not allowed to use the word watch during your, during your time.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.600]   You may not apply in Tim Cook's face.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:49.480]   I like how you're spending $600,000 and there's still a $5 minimum shipping and processing
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   what shipping.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.480]   Don't forget the tip.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   Right.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.400]   What do you get a gold ticket in the mail?
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   Come on.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   What?
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.760]   Well, anyway, that's a good cause.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:08.720]   I can't imagine spending $600,000 to meet anybody, but I guess if you've got a lot of
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.000]   money, I was, I was at a gas station yesterday.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.600]   So I'll go wing Mercedes, beautiful old Mercedes.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.200]   Took a picture of it.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.240]   It's on my Facebook and my Instagram and it was part of this thing they're doing at the
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.760]   Infinion Raceway called the California Mille 2013.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.400]   All these beautiful cars were driving to Infinion driving by me with a big sticker on
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:33.880]   the side, but this going, I asked the owner, I said, "Hi, that's a million dollar car."
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.040]   She said, "Well, actually 900,000."
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   What?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   Leo.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.440]   And you're driving it on a highway?
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   You know.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:49.040]   By the way, I just found, according to consumerist.com, the high bid wasn't validated because it was
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.080]   placed using a stolen credit card.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   That'll do it.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.960]   I bet, you know, I bet some like, you know, guy making $52,000 a year, got a phone call
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:05.800]   from, you know, city bags saying, "Hi, did you spend $605,000 for a cup of coffee?"
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.280]   What a good credit card though.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.800]   No, obviously no limit on that credit card.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   Yeah, that's a credit card.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   Right on top of that.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.840]   If someone tried to steal $250,000, well, they don't want to interfere with the legitimate
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.680]   transactions, I'll let that go.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.280]   $500,000, they'll arch an eyebrow, but maybe it's been in about $605,000.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.520]   That's when you get the phone call.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   Wow.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.960]   Your Black American Express there has been used out of order.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.520]   Imagine the miles you get on something like that.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.520]   $600,000.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.520]   So I'm really disappointed.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:38.360]   Apparently, Apple has revised its plans for the new Spaceship Campus, and they're going
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   to delay the Tonton development.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.560]   I guess they're going to have a Tonton sleeping room or something.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.560]   What is this?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   The Tont.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   Oh, Tontow.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.560]   Yeah, not Tonton.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   Tonton.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   Oh, that would have been cool.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   See, I had the wrong thing.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   I thought it was going to be like, "Hahaha!"
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   Special Tonton sleeping room for Apple employees.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.800]   Yes, special gargling annexes.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   Is that what they're supposed to be putting in?
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800]   Old Tontons run around.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.480]   Turns out the Tontons are actually living.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.280]   Some people have llamas and other things.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.680]   It turns out that Apple has Tonton.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.760]   Apple said there was a report saying Apple's behind schedule and $2 billion over budget.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.640]   Then Apple said, "No, no, we're exactly on time on budget except for the Tonton development,
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.320]   which is Phase 2, a mere 600,000 square feet.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   That's going to be the ladle."
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.280]   It was really the Tonton feeding park.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.680]   In order to train 300,000 square feet of construction from its budget, Apple has pushed
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.600]   the entire Tonton development.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.040]   I know it's called Tontow, but I'm calling it Tonton.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:43.840]   Phase 2, 600,000 square feet of office research and development buildings for 2,200 employees.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.800]   Oh, it's Tontow Avenue, North Tontow Avenue providing flexibility to address future business
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   needs.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:56.320]   Given where that is in Silicon Valley, what was the old HP campus?
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.880]   What was it it used to be?
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.000]   I could be Tonton Avenue and they just decided we better not.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   Lucas will get mad.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.240]   Someone said in the chatroom, "Tonton BBQ."
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.280]   But I really think it's Tonton sleeping bag.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.880]   I think it's a sleeping space.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.400]   For cold nights.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   Oh, no.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.000]   See, that there's of course going to be that joke, especially when all the Apple developers
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.880]   are pulling in like 100 hour weeks, like on crunch time, you walk, is it?
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:28.520]   And I thought, "Tant, how smelled bad on the outside?"
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:36.120]   By the way, the budget $5 billion for this campus and what's even more amazing is that's
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.680]   just a fraction of the total cash Apple has in the bank.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680]   Chump change.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   Chump change.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   But at their borrowing money though.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.000]   It's interest on the 100 some billion.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Say again?
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Apple's borrowing money.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   They got a little bond.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Yeah, well that's the other thing.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.040]   Okay, so tell me about what this means because I'm not a finance guy.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.040]   It's called Easy Math.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.840]   Apple brings the money back from overseas and they pay 35%.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.240]   They borrow the money and they pay 3%.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.920]   So Apple have access to the cash by selling bonds.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.840]   They're first bond offering.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.800]   They've never done this before.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.520]   The bonds will be used to buy back stock.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.920]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.840]   And what does this have to do with international money?
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.040]   Well, because it's so Apple has...
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040]   You're a high finance wizard.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   Tell me what this means.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   High finance wizard.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.200]   But I've stated all day in Express last night.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   So Apple has a hundred...
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.680]   I think I have about a hundred million dollars.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.160]   So when you hear about the big cash that Apple has, a hundred million of it is overseas.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   And they don't have...
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.640]   I'm sorry, a hundred billion.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.360]   It's a hundred billion is overseas and bringing it back into the repatriated United States
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:42.240]   would cost 35% because that's how much they'd be taxed because the United States has the
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.920]   highest corporate tax in the world.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.560]   So one of the highest in the world.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.280]   But that's higher than interest.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.280]   Because interest is not that bad.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.960]   Interest is 3%, especially if you're going to be a AAA status as Apple will.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.920]   So people are going to buy into it at 3%.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:01.280]   So Apple can stretch their US cash out and still do the buyback, which I think the buyback
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.520]   is a big FU to the Wall Street.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.800]   That's them saying, "We're not going to give you dividends."
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.800]   Screw that.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   We're just going to take some of our stock back.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.400]   Each share Apple buys back reduces its annual dividend by $12.20.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.000]   The interest on the borrowed money is $12.30 a share.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.920]   So $0.10 more than the dividend.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.360]   So there cost them $0.10.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.640]   But that's tax deductible to dividends or not.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.760]   So I think it's a plus.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   They make money.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   It's a profit thing.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   Yeah, it's a lot of math.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.640]   It turns out when you have that much money, you get really good at the math.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.640]   Really to keep you in.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.000]   You can buy good math.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Yeah, you have good people who do good math.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.440]   At a 35% tax rate, the corporate rate in the US, which by the way, no corporation to
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.840]   my knowledge ever pays except us, the borrowed money would cost Apple $8 after taxes for
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.920]   each share of boughtback.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.880]   That's obviously a profit of $4.20 per share.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.280]   So you make money buying back your shares and you say, "F you to the stock market."
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.640]   You didn't like our stock.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   Don't worry.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   We'll take it.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   But more than an "F you."
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   I don't think that's really important.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   I think it's a backhanded "F you."
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.800]   I think they're going, "Hey, we're doing something for you and they're going to keep
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   on doing those buybacks."
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800]   I mean, they're just going to keep on like this.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.640]   "Hey, we believe in the stock."
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.440]   We believe in the stock enough to say, "Hey, like that Russian guy.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.440]   We'll take some of that."
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.520]   We'll take some of that action.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.520]   He's good money.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.440]   Still, every time you hear about the transactions that Apple or Google or any large company like
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:32.120]   that does, do you figure that there are about maybe four years away from just having all
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.760]   their money in a big, big, super cargo plane that refills in the sky and never that out
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.080]   of the house?
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   Never lands.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.480]   "Untaxable by the head of God or man."
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.920]   Now, if you buy an Apple bond, you're just lending Apple money at some ridiculously low
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   rate.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   You're going to get that money.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920]   You're going to get that return.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   From a banking perspective, from Deutsche Bank or whatever, that's a solid, you put money
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   in, you get 3% back.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   And somebody at my age, I'm not supposed to buy equities anymore because I'm going to
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   be retiring any minute now.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   I want to preserve capital.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   So I would buy Apple bonds.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   That would be one way to do it.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   Or at least a lot of times your first kind of proposal.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920]   Or you're going to get that money.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   You're going to get that return.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   I'm going to get that return.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   So it's from a banking perspective, from Deutsche Bank or whatever, it's going to be, that's
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   a solid, you put money in, you get 3% back.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   And somebody at my age, I'm not supposed to buy equities anymore because I'm going to
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   get that money in.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   Or at least a lot of times your first kind of a really big boat.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.920]   Imagine how well designed those bonds will be.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   You're going to get it.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.840]   No, at least some people will buy.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.040]   And I know they did this for Apple stock.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.640]   We'll buy the bond for the certificate.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.600]   The Apple stock, when you love it, have an Apple stock, stock certificate, just one
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.080]   on the wall.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   One chair.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.080]   One chair framed.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.080]   Nice there for you as well.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.040]   Do they still send out certificates or is that really old fashion?
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.600]   I think you have to ask for them.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.520]   But you could get one.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520]   I think Apple's certificate.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.000]   I think Apple's just convert everything to Bitcoin.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Flap design.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.560]   Bitcoin, yeah, that's going to be safe.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.520]   That's going to be safe.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.400]   I message bug deletes last word of some text.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   It's not all.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.840]   This is a land of weird bugs.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.080]   They have more weird bugs than any company in history.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.640]   Like really weird.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.640]   This one is definitely--
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.920]   There's a user base that is so big that they'll find all-- if it's a one in a million
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.840]   bug and you have 100 million users, you're finding 100 of them.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.400]   Two phrases confirmed affected by the issue.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.880]   I could be the next Obama, followed by a trailing space, will result in Obama's name
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.600]   being hidden, then hit the send.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.960]   You looks good on your page, just like this one, but then hit send.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.280]   The next one is the best prize is a surprise.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   Go ahead.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.280]   Send me a message.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   Somebody.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.280]   It's an old bug.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   I think that's about three months old.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.080]   Do you have how it handles text wrapping in certain character widths?
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.520]   Oh, so it's the width of the word?
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.040]   So if you have enough words, it basically tries to go to the next line and because of
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.960]   a bug, the word ends up being nowhere.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.160]   Like lost in a limbo between the first and the second line.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.960]   And then remember who was adding?
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.040]   It was adding-- oh, no, that was actually Google.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:06.120]   Was adding a text to messages.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.000]   I guess there's something about messaging.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.040]   Either that or there really is true, there aren't enough programmers to go around.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.160]   Patrick, we paid way too little for Patrick De La Handy.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.640]   They need you down at Cupertino.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.880]   I think the problem is that all the engineers who are assigned to iMessage, they couldn't
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.160]   get tickets at WWDC.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.000]   If I just do have a program, ILS.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.800]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.400]   I do really want to talk about Apple's quarterly results.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.000]   We haven't done that.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.120]   Last week, we prepared everybody, right?
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.480]   We warned you.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.000]   We gave you an easy landing.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.360]   Turns out we didn't really need to do that.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.840]   Only made a Chajillion Dollars, not a bazillion dollars.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840]   Very disappointing down Wall Street.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   Yeah, it's not a bad.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.400]   Not a bad-- well, we'll talk about the more.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   Yeah, we'll cut back to Lamborghinis.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.640]   Our show today brought to you by the good folks.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.560]   I had to reuse some of those Lamborghines.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.760]   I can't just like leave them wherever at the restaurant and then buy another one for the
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760]   drive back.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   Exactly.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:02.760]   Austerity.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:07.080]   I'm telling you, if you buy a go-wing Mercedes, it's worth its weight in gold.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.360]   That is a beautiful car, too.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.720]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.920]   You know, my first type of LegalZoom.com.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.840]   That was an interesting site for weavers.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:23.520]   This is LegalZoom.com.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.520]   It's not a law firm.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.800]   You might infer from the name it was founded by lawyers, but really the whole idea is you
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.840]   don't need a white shoe law firm.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.480]   You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars an hour to get some of the basic law work
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.560]   that you might want to do.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560]   Done.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.080]   I'll see this way that we're still using it to it, even though now we are almost as big
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   as Apple Computer.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   Almost.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.440]   Well, we did several orders of magnitude.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.920]   RLLC is still in effect.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:54.200]   You could incorporate chapter S, chapter C. By the way, an LLC, get ready for this or
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.960]   a corporation, 99 bucks.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.800]   You should also protect your trademarks.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.400]   They do trademarks as well.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.840]   Copyrights, patents, NDAs.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.040]   It's a very simple process of just going through a checklist, filling out the form.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.360]   If you have a family, you really ought to be looking at LegalZoom for protecting your
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.520]   assets with a will, just $69, or a living trust.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.040]   Do not leave it up to the courts to decide where your kids go, where your assets go.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   You should have a will.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.920]   In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for their wills, their
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.840]   trusts, their LLCs, their trademarks.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.120]   It's so easy to use.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.320]   They've added something since I used them that I really like.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:38.000]   They have now the LegalZoom plan attorneys who will give you advice, which is, I think,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   such a great idea.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.440]   They're pre-negotiated fixed rates in almost every state.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.800]   The each attorney has a profile online and unedited review so you could see what people
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   thought of them.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   It's not unusual.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800]   You're filling out the form.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.920]   You go, "Boy, Delaware, where should I make the corporation?
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.080]   It should be a California corporation, Delaware corporation."
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   This is a great thing.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.640]   You have a fixed rate.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   You know how much it's going to cost you so you could talk to a lawyer, get your questions
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.960]   answered, even get ongoing advice.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.040]   I want you to try LegalZoom.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040]   When you visit them, use our offer code MBW.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.560]   It will give you a little reward.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.320]   It'll 10 bucks off.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.840]   I know it's not a huge amount of money.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:18.040]   It's not a share of Apple stock, but it's just a way of saying thank you for telling LegalZoom.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.880]   You heard it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.240]   Seriously, if you've got even a blog, how much is your brand worth?
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.360]   Don't let others people have access to it.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.120]   Good fences make good neighbors.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.040]   That's really what it's all about.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.840]   I trust I'm a big handshake-deal guy.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.680]   You get more trouble with that because it's not all spelled out.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.240]   I really am a believer and I really understand that.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.200]   There's a reason for the way it is.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.280]   The good news is it doesn't have to cost you an arm and leg.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.320]   LegalZoom.com, use MBW as the offer code.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.960]   All right, let's just run through Apple's results here.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.280]   I think the most interesting thing, and somebody else pointed this out, was the number of
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.680]   iPads, 19 and a half million iPads in the second quarter.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Incredible growth for the iPad.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.800]   Somebody pointed out that pretty soon Apple will not be a computer company.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.960]   Well, not even be a phone company, they'll be an iPad company.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   They will be-
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   I'm shooting-
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   I'm shooting-
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   I'm shooting appliance company.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.440]   So dominate in that space.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.920]   Which is funny because if you remember before the iPad launched there was this quote that
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.900]   was never confirmed, but there was this quote from Steve Jobs saying it was the most important
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.800]   product that he'd ever worked on.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.440]   Everyone's like, "No, that's crazy.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]   iPad?"
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.680]   65% increase year over year in iPad sales.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.720]   And I remember when the iPad came out, I said this is the computer Steve.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.040]   This is the computer Steve Jobs started Apple to make.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.240]   And they just couldn't make it in the first 20, 30 years.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.000]   Once the technology caught up with their vision, that's the computer for the rest of
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   us.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.360]   All the way down to the price point almost.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   Actually below the price point.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.200]   Yeah, 500 bucks.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.440]   iPhone, 7% year over year growth.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.040]   Both by the way, drop quarter to quarter, but you expect that.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:07.720]   That's Christmas quarter is going to be 37.4 million iPhones in three months.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.160]   For those people who say, "Oh, Android's just killing Apple."
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.720]   That's still a, okay, maybe market share is not going up, but still it's a good strong
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.720]   number.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.720]   I'm saying 37 million.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   That's okay.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.000]   If you look at profit share, Apple still does incredibly well and those numbers is a good
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   indication that's continuing.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.740]   Well, isn't that what the stock market was complaining about was decreasing margin,
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.000]   decreasing profit on their items?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.920]   Well, they're selling, the market wants them to make cheaper products, but also have higher
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   margins.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920]   Can't do both.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920]   Yeah, which is the funny thing about markets.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:45.960]   Markets know what they want, whether it's physically possible, in other manner entirely.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   Last quarter, Apple sold even more, 47.8 million iPhones.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:13:01.240]   You add those two together, the last six months, 85, no, 86 million iPhones.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.920]   This is their second best quarter ever for the iPad.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.360]   Only second best because the last quarter was their best.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.720]   Evidently, Apple is really declining quickly as you go.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.320]   They're doomed, they're doomed, Alex.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:20.360]   Unfortunately, the BlackBerry CEO says that tablets are going to be dead in five months.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   He said that today.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   He's one to know.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.200]   Well, I don't know if he said that.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.640]   BlackBerry tablets are definitely going to be dead in five years.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.400]   All right, let the Canadian defend him for years.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.080]   No, so it's always hard to tell.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.640]   Our site, Cracker, is asked for clarification because BlackBerry has this thing where they're
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.000]   saying that phones are going to be the computing platform of the future and that you'll have
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.600]   your digital brain with you and wherever you go, that'll just light up whatever screen
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   you have handy.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.040]   It's really easy to take that kind of a thing out of context and make a big headline out
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040]   of it.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.240]   We're just going to see what he actually said compared to what the quick headline was.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.720]   Yeah, I did watch the video and he didn't actually say that.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.240]   It's a good line though.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   I wish he had.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.400]   That's the 10 word answer.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.680]   Too good to fact check.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   Yeah, too good.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.680]   I thought the new iPhone ad was very interesting because it really focused on pictures taking.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.160]   Number one, camera in the world.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.600]   Number one camera in the world.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600]   I don't know where they got that number.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600]   It's true on Flickr.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.720]   Maybe it's just that Flickr stat.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.160]   More pictures are taken with the iPhone than any other camera is with the ad set.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.920]   And they have Instagram, which is probably really large too.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.800]   There's Sheriff Instagram market across Facebook as well.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.280]   It's a monster.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.760]   And aren't you kind of glad to say this is a really good sign when I first saw it because
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.640]   this is a return to Apple saying, you shouldn't buy an iPhone because, hey, it's the iPhone.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.000]   You should buy the iPhone because here's something cool that the iPhone does better
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.480]   than anything else out there at.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.280]   And so I hope we see more commercials like that.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.080]   We could see, I hope they have more.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   I'm a Mac.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.720]   I'm a PC type commercials where it says, here is what life is like with an Apple product.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.680]   Here is what life is like with a non-Apple product.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.560]   See which one you prefer to which which guy would you rather be?
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.760]   It was a great sort of it harken back to those original almost that Peter Coyote iPad
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.760]   to commercial apps.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.760]   That technology is not enough.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.720]   Being thin, being fast, being lighter, great.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.000]   But what you really need is the experience.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.080]   And that was exactly this kind of ad to me.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.680]   The combination, the intersection of science and the arts.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680]   Yep.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:24.840]   See, although there is there is there is just one bad thing to say about this in which you
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.800]   have a montage of, okay, this one iPhone user is that one that that jerk in the crowd
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   of the concert was the concert.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.800]   That's the answer.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.240]   There's that jerk parent who would rather film their child's ballet recital rather than
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.480]   actually participating in it.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480]   I am.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:45.440]   Is it only me but I think some of this is also a response to Google Glass?
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.640]   I think it's response to Samsung.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.200]   I mean, that's what I thought when I immediately saw this because Samsung is being very HTC
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.600]   and the Lumia 920 have made very specialist cameras where they're good and low light
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.800]   with non-moving targets.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:02.040]   But Samsung is aiming for exactly the same everyday camera market as Apple and Samsung.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   13 megapixels.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   I spent the last week shooting.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:09.280]   We Alex Dobi was here reviewing it and I spent the week shooting with that in the iPhone.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.760]   And it's a great everyday camera.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.600]   I think Apple's trying to show you that these are the moments that you want to capture and
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.640]   they'll do a really great job of any kind of picture you throw at it.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.400]   And admittedly Google Glass is not in any way a market threat to Apple.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.640]   But I just have to say the Google Glass has like a lot like this.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.400]   It has Google in the shower.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   I don't think so.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.560]   It's a total because people can immediately respond to the idea of taking pictures of your
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560]   life and your kids and stuff like that.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560]   That's what it is.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.560]   Google Glass.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.800]   Google is still they'll get people in the shower.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.760]   Here's something cool that you haven't seen ever before.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.400]   But then once they get your attention, how are they going to get your money out of you?
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.880]   This Apple, this Apple ad is a we're going to get your money out.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.960]   Get your money out of you with this ad sort of thing.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:55.080]   I have to say, and I will be excreated by our audience for this, but I think the HTC
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.120]   One camera is actually better than the iPhone.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.640]   I got to shoot with that too.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.680]   And it's better in low light with non moving targets.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.520]   Great phenomenal camera.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.480]   I believe two microns, four megapixels was a really gutsy idea.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.880]   I'm glad they did it.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.120]   But all the time shooting, like when you're not ready, when you just see something and
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.080]   you want to shoot it, I like the iPhone still a little bit more, not in low light obviously,
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.120]   but in just general shooting.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.800]   I like it better.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.400]   The HTC One, even in a big light.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.280]   And I think the Zoes are a huge breakthrough.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280]   I'd be very interested as the Apple.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.360]   I would respond to that.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.960]   The idea that you could take short, what they are is there's three second clips, video
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.840]   clips, but they're also at the same time as shooting video, it's shooting 20 frames of
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.920]   still high quality still, and you can mix and match.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.800]   So if I shoot three seconds or something, I've got 20 frames to choose from.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.360]   And I think even in bright light, the quality is superb.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.600]   I have not seen, I think it's everybody's as good as an Apple camera.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.080]   That's really the sort of clever that I'm hoping to see from Apple with the next iOS.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.640]   Because I think we are starting to hit the limits of how good a picture can we get out
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.800]   of an image sensor that's this big and a lens that's only this far away from that image
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   sensor.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.680]   But once they start figuring out, okay, well, what if we have a camera where it is always
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:17.000]   on, it's always capturing the previous five or 10 seconds of what's around you.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.440]   And you're using the camera button to say, okay, now analyze the previous two seconds,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.200]   figure out what shot I was trying to take and then find the best shot in there and try
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200]   to take that guess.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.760]   I think I think Apple could do some incredible things that same.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760]   Samsung's doing that.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.080]   That's part of the new Galaxy S4 is the best shot.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.240]   I don't trust the camera to choose that.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.320]   Yeah, and Blackberry does that with their, you can rewind.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.080]   If you have a group of photos, it won't just let you select the one shot that's the best.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.880]   It will actually let you figure out, okay, here are four faces in here.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.560]   I will let you rewind each face for the best facial expression.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:54.200]   But what Apple would do far better than Samsung is just this idea of this camera is one button
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.280]   that you press to take a picture.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.040]   We will not make it much more complicated than that.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.640]   We will put maybe two more buttons in a drawer that hides away when you're not using it.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.120]   But how much power and how much intellect we put behind one camera take a picture button.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.360]   And this is something Apple could do better than anybody else.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.560]   Yeah, it's an opportunity.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.000]   I zoid all my receipts by accident.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.160]   I was taking all my travel receipts.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.160]   You gotta be careful.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160]   We don't want to zoe.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.280]   And the other problem with zoe is it uploads to Dropbox and to Google and anywhere else
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   you have automatic uploads turned on Facebook, 20 images for everyone you take.
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:34.120]   So I have a lot of images in my photo stream of the same kind of roughly the same thing.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.920]   Here's that gullwing by the way.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.680]   And so what happens is this is the zoe that I took is this three seconds.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.880]   But it also takes out of that three seconds.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.120]   It takes 20 images.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:50.640]   I think in bright light, the color representation is excellent.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.160]   I think it's good in all quality of light.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.360]   I could not be happier with this camera, frankly.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.200]   I cannot be happy with that car.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.840]   Do you not want this car?
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.840]   Is that gorgeous?
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.840]   Gorgeous car.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.840]   Oh, man.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.840]   I want that with the iPhone integration.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.280]   I don't know what year that is, but it's probably 60s.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.520]   It looks kind of has that Carmen Guilla kind of styling.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.520]   How much is the towing package for that car?
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.520]   Can you imagine?
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.520]   Come on.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.520]   $900,000 car.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   It's going to have someone come here to ask it.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.520]   It's a classic.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.760]   It's probably included to that price.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.600]   I don't want to ever buy a car that does not have an option.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.040]   I need something called the police pursuit package.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.480]   That means that this is the sort of car that I could be interested in.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   All right.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.640]   I want to buy my next computer.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.480]   I hope has a police pursuit package.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.760]   Damn straight and lights on the top.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:48.560]   Anything else that I Mac book.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.360]   I think we're done.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.840]   I think it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.840]   I'm just looking through the stories.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.840]   Google now, Leo.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.560]   Oh, well, that could be a pick.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.680]   Maybe somebody will do that.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.240]   You want to make that your well, you got a pick, don't you, Renee?
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240]   All right.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.200]   Well, we'll mention Google now then at 3.0 version of Google just came out yesterday
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.160]   for iOS, both iPad and iPhone.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.800]   And if you haven't noticed yet, you might want to open it up because it does have cards
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.360]   as the Google now style cards.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.200]   Now the difference, of course, is you have to open the app to see the cards.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.360]   I couldn't find the app in the app store.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.560]   Google search is added to the Google search app.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560]   It's called--
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.560]   OK, I got it.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.560]   It's the Google search app.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560]   I can't believe you don't have that installed.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560]   I'm just--
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   I'm busy.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.160]   And Google now is great.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.800]   I mean, the card interface is fantastic.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.200]   It tries to do predictive search, which was that holy grail of digital assistant where
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.840]   it knows where you are, knows what your calendar is, knows what traffic is like, and it tries
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.440]   to-- knows what the weather is, who tries to give you the information before you even
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.520]   ask for it.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.320]   There's no push notifications yet, and it does keep your location on all the time, which
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.760]   some people don't like.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.720]   But I think it's fantastic, and I'm glad that Google put it on iOS, and I want to see what
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   Apple's next move is.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.720]   It's--
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.840]   It's to me, and I'm sure Andy will agree, a killer app for Android.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.480]   Although now it's on iOS, perhaps more than Android.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.120]   Oh, yeah, more users, right?
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.680]   Because you have to have Android 4.1 or better.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:15.200]   But I do think that at the very moment, everyone should give it a try.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.560]   And I think that at-- I think it'll convince a lot of people to have the Google search
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.280]   app in their doc, not just on their first home page.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.280]   It is that useful.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.640]   I mean, the way that I try to describe the difference between Siri and Google now is
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   that Siri is the assistant in the next room where all I have to do is shout through the
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.080]   door, "Here's what I want, and Siri will make that happen."
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.080]   Google now is the assistant that hands you your jacket, and you put on the jacket, and
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.120]   "Oh, the tickets to the ballgame are right there, and oh, here's a map to where I'm supposed
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   to go."
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.720]   Because it predicts what you want to do and puts information right where it has to go
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.520]   when you're doing it.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.760]   What really sold me on Google now was the first time I actually took a trip with my
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.560]   Android phone as my primary device.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.640]   And, "Oh, instead of having to drill into eight different apps on iOS, all I have to
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.880]   do is touch the home key, and it's all there, and I didn't even have to tell it what to
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   do."
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   It's kind of cool.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   It's kind of cool.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   It's actually-- it's actually-- it looks through-- I mean, this is what people don't
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   like Google about.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   It looks through your email.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.440]   It outlines airline receipts.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.560]   It'll put the barcode for the ticket in your Google now.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.600]   It kind of watches what you search for on Google and gives you those search results.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.120]   If you search for a baseball or basketball team or a football team a lot, or in your
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:34.560]   case, a curling team, Renee, it will then put up the results if the game-- at the end
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.640]   of the game-- shows stock results, and it pays attention to what stocks you're looking
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   at.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.560]   The fact that it knows a lot about you is what makes it so useful.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.560]   And everyone involved, including Google.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   What's interesting with me?
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.680]   Yeah, well, that's what's interesting to me because Google, there's been a lot of talk
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.240]   about the creep factor, and yet everybody who I know when they talk about Google now,
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.480]   I never hear the creep factor.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.000]   I always hear universally, "Wow, this is useful."
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.760]   Travis knows everything about Tony Starkleo.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:04.240]   I feel as though there's-- all that I require is that there be a transaction involved.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.640]   If there's something where I will give you-- I will let you have access to personal information,
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.160]   but what are you going to give me in return?
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.720]   And if Google gives me the service like this, and it gives me Google Maps, and it gives
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.520]   me all these services, I feel as though, "Okay, I feel as though I'm getting about $103
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.000]   per month worth of services that I would pay for."
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.400]   This seems like it's okay, given that they're not Facebook, I'm willing to make that transaction.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.440]   And yet, Gmail, people do feel Gmail-- or at least Microsoft's made a lot of, "Hey, based
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.320]   on that," that Gmail-- the fact that-- but Gmail's a fabulous, free service that a lot
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.720]   of people use.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.360]   You get a lot of value out of Gmail, but they don't like the fact that it's--
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.240]   How much would you pay per month for point-to-point navigation with Street View Maps, turn-by-turn
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.080]   navigation, and live traffic?
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.360]   How much would you pay-- how much would you get charged per month for that if you were
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.920]   not getting that for free from Google?
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.920]   Right.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.400]   And if it's not worth it to you, just don't use it.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.400]   You don't have to use it.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.440]   In iOS, particularly, you don't have to use it.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.560]   It's kind of a default feature of Android, although it asks you the first time, "Do
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560]   you want to use this?"
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   And you can say yes or no.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   And it's easy to see.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.760]   And I think, Phon Dickinson wrote this a long time ago, that Google now could just be the
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   next interface for Android.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   Right.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.120]   Instead of a Facebook phone, you'll have a Google Now+ phone, and it'll just do everything
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.120]   for you.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.600]   Not to make this a Google show, but I think there's a real opportunity after seeing what
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.960]   Facebook did with Facebook Home for Google and Google Plus and Google Now to make a launcher
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.040]   for Android that does the same thing.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.120]   And when you start thinking about watching interfaces, stuff like Google Now cards and
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.680]   stuff like Siri widgets start making a lot of sense on a small screen.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.520]   And now we get back to Google Glass, too, because those are interfaces that will work
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.960]   just as well on the watch.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:46.320]   I know that Apple likes to focus on things, and they never do this, but wouldn't it be
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:50.960]   cool if they had a couple of engineers that they've got two years left in their contracts,
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.560]   they're not being assigned anything, and they can do whatever they want.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.200]   And they decide, "You know what?
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.240]   We're going to decide the first Apple launcher replacement for Android, where you turn on
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.840]   your phone and you get access to your iTunes natively, you get access to iMessage, all
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840]   the other cool things.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.960]   We're going to basically give you sort of like the pacifier in your mouth that leads
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.920]   you back over to Apple."
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.720]   Our picks of the week, let's start with you.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.520]   Poor Don has not been able to get a word in Edge-wise.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.880]   That's because he's all the way over across the pond.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.680]   Yeah, sorry Don.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680]   Never mind.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   Never mind.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   It's okay.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   You're too polite.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680]   Right, picks.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   Right.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680]   Okay, I've got a good pick for you this week.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.520]   It's been an experiment by BitTorrent, which they've just made publicly available.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.640]   And that's BitTorrent Sync.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:39.760]   And we all use Dropbox and various other sort of file syncing services.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.000]   But this is rather unique in that it allows you to set up a folder on one machine.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.720]   It can be a Windows machine, a Linux machine or a Mac, and then set up a corresponding folder
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.920]   on another machine.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.440]   And it uses the power of BitTorrent to automatically synchronize between them securely and for
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.440]   free.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   And it works very, very well.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.080]   So it's like a Dropbox, except it's peer to peer.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080]   It's decentralized.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080]   It's peer to peer.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.880]   It uses the BitTorrent protocols to actually sort of encrypt and to split up your files
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.120]   into little bits and send them across.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:15.240]   So you can have your own sort of private sharing network without any cloud services.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.160]   It's all done from peer to peer.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   Interesting.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.440]   I, that may be the first great legitimate use for BitTorrent.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   Or illegitimate use.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.240]   I mean, you can have a bunch of different people with the thing.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240]   Shh.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   Shh.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.640]   It's the on the illegitimate A.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.520]   You know, Pig Latin isn't really a very good way to obfuscate comments.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:41.560]   So labs.bitTorrent.com/experiments if you want to find out what they're up to there.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   That's a really interesting product.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.680]   Have you been using it for a while?
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.720]   I've been using it for a week or so.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.720]   And pretty reliable.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.960]   It says what it does where it says on the tin.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.960]   Yeah, it seems to be fine.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.960]   That's what it says on the tin.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.920]   I like it.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.280]   Don is that screen casts online.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.600]   Just a fabulous guy.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.080]   You a barber in veteran travelers.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.120]   You got anything coming up?
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.840]   Often, often all the way in a week to actually.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   You're going to Norway.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.200]   Yeah, just do a cruise around the fields.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.200]   Non-working this time.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.680]   We're just taking a break.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680]   I'm fine.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   Looking forward to that.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.840]   And then Cyprus, I think, in the autumn I've got my nieces getting married in Cyprus.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.800]   And then there's another Mac Baine next year.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   Next year.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   It's actually coming to Liverpool.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800]   You're kidding.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.720]   Oh, I might have to do that one.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   That'd be fun.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.560]   Mac Mania 14, I guess, or 15.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   17.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.960]   17, no, they've been saying.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   17, yeah.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.160]   And one of the courts is actually Liverpool, my hometown.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160]   So it's weird.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.160]   That is really cool.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160]   Are you going on that one?
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160]   Yes.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160]   Yeah, I'll be going on that one.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.360]   It seems silly to go on a cruise to your hometown.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.160]   Yeah, it seems weird.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.800]   You know, they're a good gang.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   So I'll just go.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   It's really for the people.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.240]   And Gene McDonald smiles off in there.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   That's fun.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.800]   I always wanted to scuba dive off those reefs you have there off of Liverpool.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.960]   The weather is so warm, the white sand beaches.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.360]   It's just fabulous.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.640]   Andy and I go, you're pick of the week.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.080]   This is not an inexpensive item, but it's a cool item.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.800]   This is Sony's new digital binoculars.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.800]   Oh, my God.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   DV50V.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.800]   Whoa.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:20.200]   And so it is like a parapanoculars only.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.760]   And it is like pure optical binoculars with the difference being that, as sent into
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.080]   this, instead of being just purely lenses that feed into the eyepieces, these are essentially
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.560]   twin like HD camcorders with very, very long powerful power zoom attached.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:43.040]   So you can use it like a regular binocular, but it also gives you like the cool stuff where
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.720]   you can have a zoom so you can actually zoom in and zoom out.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.640]   You can record in 3D.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.000]   If what you're looking at is interesting enough that you want to record a picture of
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   it, you can record.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   This looks like Luke Skywalker's.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   I know.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   Exactly.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   It's like great.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.320]   Oh, it's going to give me heck if I don't get those George back.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.840]   And it also has a low light capability.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.240]   So it does a light amplification.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.880]   It's not like infrared goggles.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.120]   It's not like, you know, night vision goggles, but you can see a lot more in the dark in
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.520]   low light with these and you could with normal binoculars probably.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.640]   And the it's cool because if you think of it, the two, the two things I like.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.280]   I like about these despite the fact that they're rather expensive.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:33.920]   One is that think about this less as a pair of binoculars and more as a camera that has
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.280]   a 36 to 2,000 millimeters zoom lens on it.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.160]   Meaning that, you know, if, if like the thing that you want to take a look at is anywhere
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.080]   on your side of the planet, you can probably get a good close look at it.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.760]   The picture that's been behind me or of course took an opportune moment to actually
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:54.280]   dim out is, you know, squirrels in the backyard having a chance to do a lot of nature spotting
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.960]   with them with them yet about messing around with it.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.400]   But the other cool thing is that this it does have a certain like Google Glass sort of
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.960]   coolness about it where it's a little bit more bulky than a Google Glass.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   A little bit.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   Well, well, you can use toys.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.720]   You walk around with this and I think I think what people really worried about is that they
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.880]   don't want to make sure they they're worried that like they don't know that you're taking
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:15.880]   their picture.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.760]   But you walk into the into the sibaro like like this, you probably know that there is
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.720]   there a release on it says objects may be nearer than they appear.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.960]   No, there's a little whack to the forehead as you bump into a door that is not 50 feet
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.960]   away.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:33.560]   But it's it's an interesting twist because if you think about it, if you're looking
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.880]   through something, if you're looking at something through binoculars, there is an implication
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.960]   that whatever you're looking at is interesting enough that you take out these things to look
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.320]   at them with.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   And so there's an implication that whatever you want to see is probably worth taking a
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.800]   picture of.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.640]   And so all you have to do at any time is just press this one button and you take a 20 megapixel
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.560]   snapshot of it.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:00.200]   It's also cool in that it's probably the only 3D video camera I've seen that seems I could
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:05.720]   I could I could see actually being able to use this in a practical way because when you
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.320]   want to share something with somebody else, what you're going to visit their house, you're
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:15.240]   going to bring along your 3D TV set, hand out 3D glasses, or you just hand them this and
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:18.800]   say, well, this is what Julie's softball game was like.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.440]   And now they can actually see it really the exact same way you saw it by holding up this
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.160]   device to your eyes.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.320]   And of course, now you still have that problem where you look like the parent dork in the
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.880]   stands, but at least you're walking to watch your kids game while you're taking video of
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   your kids.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.880]   That's kind of cool.
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.840]   So it's it's how big is the sensor on that?
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.640]   Do they say?
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.040]   I don't know how big the sensor is.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.680]   It's not as big as you think it is.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.720]   I actually have the tech specs in front of me.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.080]   It doesn't come out for the couple of months.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.520]   So I don't even have they don't even have a manual ready for it yet.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   So I've been sort of like struggling along with it as I go.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   Oh, exactly.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.080]   So sensors not small.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.280]   It's not too bad.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.240]   And the pictures the pictures I've been taking so far, I don't know if this is the final
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.560]   firmware or not.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:07.360]   The pictures are good, but not as good as I would get if I had like a really decent
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.320]   zoom lens on a conventional camera.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.200]   But for but they're they're sharp.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.560]   They're they're printable.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.920]   They're they're decent pictures.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.040]   They're just not mind blowing.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.320]   And you still have and you and nothing and although they are optically stabilized, so
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:26.040]   you can actually like be looking at something at very, very high zoom and not see this sort
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.040]   of like jerky.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.040]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.640]   So I'm actually finding them easier to use than any other binoculars I've tried for that
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640]   reason.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:37.680]   But at the same at the same stroke, these are at the at the long end, these the this is
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.200]   still like a 2000 millimeter lens.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.600]   So that's why probably like for really super long, you would you would wind up using the
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.240]   tripod mount for it.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.440]   But now they're their chairman's guessing on prices everywhere from 500 to one and a half
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.400]   Alex's is a little more than that.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.040]   It is $2,000 three Alex's almost.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.120]   Hey, do you know if it doesn't live output?
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.440]   Do you know if it does like HDMI live output does have HDMI out?
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.520]   I don't know if it has a live out.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   I should try.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   We'll try on your behalf.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   I will try that.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.520]   Excellent.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.600]   You could use that for I don't know what long distance hangouts you could be hanging
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.600]   out with a guy.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.600]   You'll be doing like a.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.600]   He's talking.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600]   He's down on the field.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:22.440]   Well, no, so the next time that you like you do like a webcast, you can say, hi, it's
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.440]   Leo LaPort.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.240]   As you can see, I'm here in the front row at Tim Cote's big keynote.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.240]   That was great for the keynote.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.480]   I've got because they never know they would just think I have been an op-work interview.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.480]   Exactly.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:40.280]   But yeah, but I mean, so if you can get past the price, interesting device, it's not the
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.080]   the they did their first version of this last year and did look a lot more like Luke's
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.240]   guy, Walker's binoculars, it was a lot longer is a lot chunkier is a lot heavier.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.680]   These are actually more along the lines of like a real binocular.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.000]   So I'll make a deal.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.120]   If Apple ever invites me to a keynote ever again, I'll buy those bring them.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.840]   Which is ensuring that he'll never get invited.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.160]   Yeah, that's a good idea, Leo, because if you're holding up like this, they probably
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.160]   can't see your face.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.320]   Who is that?
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.400]   Who's that behind those big old binoculars?
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.040]   Alex Lindsey, what do you got for us today?
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.040]   Anything?
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.640]   You may have guessed, I spent a lot of time in airports.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.640]   Yes.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.640]   A lot of time.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.640]   Yes.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.720]   And one of the things that drives me crazy is having to wander around trying to figure
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.440]   out where my flight is and when it's when it's going to take off.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.600]   You're looking for the enunciator.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.600]   Look at this.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.120]   They don't have an enciators anymore, do they?
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.560]   That's a train station thing.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.800]   So this, look at that.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.040]   It's just like the one of the airport.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.200]   It is, but it's more featured.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.720]   So it's called flight board.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720]   Flight board.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:40.200]   So, but it it up a shot of that or should I move it over at Chaddington?
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   Move it over.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.360]   So, so here's the thing.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.120]   Tell it what airport you're in.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.640]   And it just gives you the same.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.000]   Now you can what's kind of cool is you can search by.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.080]   So look at the little top, you can hit flight number, destination, time.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.080]   You can change what?
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.080]   I could say gates.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.080]   Yeah, sort by gate.
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.080]   Why you do that?
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.080]   I don't know.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080]   But but the parts.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.080]   What what's the nearest flight?
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.080]   Let's see.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.080]   I'm in here.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.080]   I can go to port and then what that.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.280]   So, see it tells you what kind of aircraft I see.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.520]   Oh, and I can share.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.760]   You can share a book, note the software developers that is the reaction you want while your app
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760]   is being live demo.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.760]   I do like this.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.000]   You could open it in flight track, which I also use.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   Right.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   Right.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   So that's very handy.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.360]   And so and then you can go from departures to arrivals and it'll switch out for you.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.840]   And what's funny was, yes, he should.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.840]   That's good.
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:33.000]   The the interesting thing is that I had one when I was flying last week and I I had a
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.040]   different time that what was on the on the on the on the monitors.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.560]   I was like, oh, it's not that accurate.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.800]   And then of course, 10 minutes later, the monitor at the airport changed.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.800]   Wow.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.800]   Keep up.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.400]   So it's getting a feed that was faster than what the airport was doing.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.120]   So I felt like I was even smarter than the airport.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:50.120]   There's an airline.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.520]   There's an airline called Bombardier.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.080]   I'd like to fly that.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.080]   Wow.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.360]   Yeah, they don't actually land.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.360]   They just drop you out.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.160]   Just just a one TSA ask you what airline you're on.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.160]   You can't tell them.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   You can't.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160]   You wouldn't want to know.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160]   They put you in these little capsules.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.040]   They put you in little capsules that look a lot like bombs.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.360]   And then they just simply drop you over your is really a great way to get to hard to find
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.760]   places where there's not a lot of airports.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.520]   It's just really, really cool.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   Isn't that cool?
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.440]   Yeah, Bombardier 610 going to Bedford Hanover.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.640]   Oh, it's arrived.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:43.480]   You really should make the chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.480]   Yeah, it should.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.480]   That would be the one thing that would work.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.480]   How much is this beautiful piece of work?
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.480]   I think it's nine ninety nine.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.480]   I wonder if it's nine ninety nine, but I'm not sure.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   No, it's not that expensive.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.480]   I've read nine of it.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.480]   Yeah, it's cheap.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.480]   It's cool.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.480]   Nice pick.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:56.240]   You're flying away.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.480]   How about you, Minister Renee Minichy?
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.400]   I'm picking draft version three.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.000]   Oh, we should point out that didn't we do this?
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.560]   Was this your pick?
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.360]   Or was it Andy's pick?
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.360]   Wasn't it?
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   Oh, I think so.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.000]   I think last week you picked this Andy.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   I missed last week.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   You weren't here last week.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   I apologize.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   No, that's all right.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.400]   Go ahead and talk about why you like it.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.000]   I was using the original draft because for me it was time shifting for ideas.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.960]   I could just, when any time I thought of anything, I didn't have to care about where I put
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:27.960]   it or what I did with it.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.600]   I just had it get it into drafts and then I could put it anywhere else when I had more
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.640]   time or more inclination.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.600]   Why no where this was a pick iPad today?
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.760]   Yeah, that's where my pick last week was Daedalus, which is a similar ish app.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.760]   So never mind.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.600]   Go ahead because no, because unless people watched iPad today, they didn't see it.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.320]   But this was Sarah's pick last week.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.320]   I'm going to echo Sarah then.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.080]   And one of the one of the problems out of the previous version is that for some things
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.080]   it wasn't fast enough.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.360]   For example, I can use Siri to enter reminders or to do quick things very quickly.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.200]   And what they did with draft 3.0 now is that you can set up a drafts list in reminders.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.760]   And then when you add something to reminders, it's automatically brought into drafts the
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.640]   next time you open up the app.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.120]   And you can also export things back out to reminders.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.080]   So now for pretty much anything that I want to do or anything that I want to get down in
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.480]   a text form, I just put it in there.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.200]   I can polish it up when I want.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.560]   And I can put it out to Twitter, to Facebook, to app.net.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.880]   I can send it to reminders.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.080]   I can send it to messages.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.960]   And I can do-- it's almost like that old app Birdhouse, which was a way to carefully
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.240]   craft your tweets, but it goes everywhere.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.200]   So you can use this to tweet.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.600]   You can use it to draft almost anything, any smallish amount of text.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600]   And I use it.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.360]   I've done paragraphs for blog posts that I thought were just interesting and I didn't
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360]   want to forget about.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.360]   Just save them.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.360]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.680]   iPad, but also on the App Store.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.040]   Yeah, you can get it for iPhone or iPad.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.040]   They're different versions.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.160]   Developers try to get different business models, but I bought it for both and it's
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.600]   absolutely well worth it.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.880]   Yeah, I actually did too.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.560]   As soon as they showed me it.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:03.600]   The idea being able to use a markdown in my tweets just appealed to the nerd in me.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:07.880]   You don't have square brackets in your tweets, Leo, you're not geeking it right.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.240]   Renee Richie said, I'm more.com right now.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.760]   They're in New York City trading phones with one another.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760]   You can catch them online.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:20.200]   I'm more.com and also there are many other publications, including crackberry.com.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   Crackberry.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.120]   Android Central, WP Central.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.000]   And we have WebOS Nation, but it's not doing much right now.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.600]   It's a little quiet in the web.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.640]   It's not really a nation now.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.200]   It's a small duchy.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.200]   It's a person.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.400]   Janice Jackson's rhythm nation could annex the web.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.640]   Coming to an LG television sometime near you.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   That's right.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   They at least licensed it.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.160]   Lindsay's at the Pixel Core and drops in from time to time with his luggage cases.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.920]   I thought people would enjoy this.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.920]   Look at the size.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   Look at this.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920]   This is why I don't like walking around trying to figure out where the next flight is.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   This is the luggage he brought to Cancun.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   Hold on.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.840]   That's just the vacation luggage.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.680]   You know, it's just, you know, wait, see, and the cart in the front, just if you didn't
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.160]   notice, the cart in the front is the, I checked that cart.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   It looks broken.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.160]   No, it's okay.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.160]   I checked that cart.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.160]   The cart folds up.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   That's cool.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160]   We wrap it up.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   I bring my own luggage cart.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.880]   Well, because you can't put that much on the carts that come with it.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.200]   Although the ones in Cancun were very nice.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.160]   The one in the back is a Cancun cart.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.400]   Not as good as pits, but not as bad as pits, perks.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.400]   I know.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.400]   You don't bring this cat to the cart.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.040]   Pittsburgh is one of the best airports in the country except for the carts, but bad
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040]   luggage carts.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.040]   Bad luggage carts.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.840]   That's one way to get a body away from crime scene.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   Yes.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   Exactly.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   The other way flying bomb a deer.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   Exactly.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   By the way, everybody says, no, no, Leo.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.800]   I know how you pronounce bombod.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   But bombod.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.080]   Yeah, does not fool anyone.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.800]   It's still bombod.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:45.480]   By the way, I'll be traveling a lot over the next month, unlike the other months.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480]   So we won't see you.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.480]   No, no, I'll be around.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   Where you going?
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.480]   I'll be in different places.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.480]   I'm not.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.480]   Tash 2.0.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.040]   You know, like London, Kenya, or London, Kenya, or what?
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.040]   All those.
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.200]   So the-- but if you-- I will be trying to do some tweetups because I'm trying to meet
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.480]   new people, especially people with the two production because we're looking for more
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:02.480]   people.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.480]   Oh, good.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   So follow his Twitter.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.840]   Yeah, I'll tweet it when I'm-- it may be the same day because I never know what I'm
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.080]   doing until I get there.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:15.040]   A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y for Alex Lindsay on Twitter.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.920]   Mr. Andy, and not because of the Chicago Sun Times joins us each and every week for
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.920]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.920]   So nice to have you once again, Andrew.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920]   Always great.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.080]   And Renee, if you're swapping phones with everybody, I hope you're using PRL.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:28.080]   Really?
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.560]   I should mention that if you want to see what we're doing, you can go to #TM13 on Twitter
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.240]   or Google+, and we're putting everything in there.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240]   TM13.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240]   Yes.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.960]   We're still going to get that website up, but it'll be up soon.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960]   Oh, Tyler Moore.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:43.960]   Tyler Moore.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.920]   It's a merry together, more phone site.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.360]   Yeah, and we have a bunch of more.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.360]   We have a bunch of more.
