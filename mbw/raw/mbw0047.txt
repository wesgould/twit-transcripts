[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, once again,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040]   freed from the tyranny of the iPhone,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.600]   we talk about the Mac with Scott Born of the Applephone
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160]   show.com.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.760]   Hi.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.360]   Great picture of you in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.280]   Who was it that said it should be called Born Again?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.080]   Dane said that.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.280]   But I'll tell you some secret about that picture.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.960]   I'm holding the iPhone bag really high,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.040]   and there's a reason for that.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   There's no iPhone in it.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.560]   Oh.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.600]   I quickly did some sleight of hand
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.160]   and put the iPhone in a Safeway grocery bag.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.320]   In case there are anybody out there trying to steal my iPhone.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.640]   Oh, that's very funny, very clever of you.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.680]   Nobody did, by the way.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   So you're safe.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.400]   Alex Lindsay is here.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.000]   Actually, he was more afraid that Merlin
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.360]   man would blow up his iPhone.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.400]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Alex Lindsay is also here from thepixelcore.com.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.240]   How's it going?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.040]   And Merlin man of 43folders.com and the Merlin man
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   show who says, for more information about the iPhone,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.280]   consult the internet.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.560]   He's done with the iPhone.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   I'm glad that the story is out there.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.360]   There's finally some information I can follow up,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.120]   find a little about how this works.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.840]   I'm really glad to see.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.160]   I can finally learn how people are enjoying it.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.680]   I had not at all tempted to run out and get one.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.440]   You still can.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680]   I think the Staten Island Apple Store
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.400]   still has two or three left.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   Well, it's funny.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   After we had finished our show we did on Friday,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   I had learned a bunch of friends of mine
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   had gone out to have a drink and had house shields.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   And as a group all walked straight into the Apple Store
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.760]   and five minutes later walked out with iPhones,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.320]   the entire group.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.000]   There was no reason to wait in line as it turned out.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.960]   But it was fun waiting line.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   But it's the new impulse buy for sure.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.640]   That's a big impulse buy.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.840]   This is a number of different reports
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.880]   of how many iPhones that were sold over the weekend.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.080]   But they're all around half a million to 700,000.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.240]   The most credible seems around 700,000.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.560]   Is that right, Scott?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.760]   That's amazing.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.520]   Yeah, more than a quarter billion dollars
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.800]   with revenue in one weekend for the kind of people
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.320]   that keep tracking that sort of thing that will not all book
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.680]   to the same quarter.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.280]   Apple's decided to split that up over quarters.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.040]   And they're also taking some of that revenue
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640]   according to Sarbanes Oxley over 24 month periods
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   of them getting trouble.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.640]   But bottom line is they made a bunch of money
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.600]   and the stocks up almost six bucks today.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.320]   They're making, according to some,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.560]   they're making about $300 or $400 a phone.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.320]   So that's some good bucks.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   And they're making money on every single AT&T contract.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.400]   Yeah, that's a good day for Apple.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.320]   And that's why the stock is up.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   It went down briefly, but not for very long.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.960]   There was a little profit taking, but boy,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.000]   people clearly think Apple's got more in the stock there.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   200.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   200, that's our new prognosis for the man who ought to know
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.520]   because he's pumping it up right now.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   (laughing)
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.800]   When I called 100, everybody said, "Beshah."
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.840]   Well, it's true, it's true.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.040]   Let's see, I just wanna make sure
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.440]   that we don't leave out any major iPhone stories.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.880]   We're not gonna do an all iPhone show.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.040]   We've kind of done that.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   I mean, everybody, you know, Kevin Rose says
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.200]   his iPhone has been rebooting all day, 15 times it's rebooted.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   So I think the next sound you hear will be iPhone problems
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.480]   and woes, but you'd expect that
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   with any machine that sells that many units,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   there's gonna be some bad ones.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.320]   I'm sorry, it's Kevin Rose.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.600]   It's suffering from that.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.360]   Have you guys actually had your iPhone reboot?
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.320]   Not at all, never.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   It's very hot right now.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.520]   I wonder if it has to do with heat.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   It doesn't have a huge heat tolerance.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   I mean, the operating range Apple specifies is fairly narrow.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.400]   113 is the top end.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.680]   So if you were in a hot car or, you know, it was a hot room,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.640]   I guess it could have problems.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   Yours has had problems, Alex?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.040]   No, I know.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.760]   Well, what, I kept on thinking,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   I was talking to Merlin about this earlier.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.480]   I was, I kept on thinking that my phone was,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.200]   that I was hitting some button with my Safari
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.440]   because I'd end up back in the main page.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.840]   And someone told me that that's actually Safari, you know,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   rebooting, you know, it's crashing.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.400]   Oh, it's crashing.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   It was crashing.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.560]   Oh.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160]   So it's suddenly, 'cause like, there's been,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.360]   and that happens, it's been happening,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.760]   I have to admit for me every, like two or three times a day.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.720]   Well, I'll be surfing away and then suddenly I end up back
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.120]   in the main, in the main area with all the icons.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.520]   Oh, that's actually, I think it was,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.120]   I figured there's some button that I'm hitting
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   or something that I'm pushing
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.880]   But someone told me, oh, that's actually,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.120]   that's actually Safari rebooting.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   Now what happens is when you get back to Safari,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.080]   it's back to the page that you were at.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.720]   That's why I didn't even think of it as a crash.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.440]   So it remembers where it was.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.880]   Yeah, it wasn't, it's a pretty minor thing.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.840]   But I think that was about it.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.960]   But otherwise, I think it's,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800]   it's a minor thing.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.120]   Some slowdowns, but it hasn't crashed,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.480]   it's been pretty reliable.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   Occasionally it'll just kind of stall out
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   and start thinking, no beach ball,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.560]   Apple's smart enough not to put the beach ball in this one.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   Very, very wise.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.200]   I think I think it's getting,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.360]   making sure that my fingers moving when I go to scroll.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.040]   Otherwise I start selecting a whole lot of stuff
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   I don't want to select.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   That's a good point.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   That's a good idea.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   When do you think we'll see a firmware update?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.960]   I know there's one in the works, there's gotta be.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.160]   There's gotta be one in the next week or two.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.320]   What day is it?
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.240]   It's Tuesday, why, you think of it this week?
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.320]   Oh, maybe tomorrow.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.160]   Really?
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.800]   All right, I bet it'd be really quickly.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   Yeah, there's probably lots of little things
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.800]   they wanna tighten up.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.320]   Like spelling Leo's name.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.160]   Another reason for that.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.280]   I don't know if you guys saw this.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.520]   There's a guy who made a backpack.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.760]   (laughing)
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.480]   All right, message received.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.720]   Have you guys seen that yet?
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.360]   He actually, he can put stuff in it,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   he wears it on his back.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   Out of an iPhone?
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.120]   No, no, it was a Mac SE.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   SE.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.560]   You know what, that's a great idea to make a tiny--
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.200]   Make one out of the iPhone?
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.560]   Maybe you can make a wallet out of your iPhone.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   That would be a twist.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.040]   Just take the guts out, put some money in there.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.960]   The opposite of that phone guy.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.120]   (laughing)
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.080]   Universal music, and there may be a little trouble
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.120]   in paradise, universal music is apparently saying
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.520]   they're not gonna do a long-term deal with Apple.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.840]   At first, the rumors were it wouldn't do a deal at all
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   with Apple, now they're saying maybe a short-term deal.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.600]   What's going on with Universal?
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   Does anybody know here?
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.800]   It sounds like they're on a month to month.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.480]   They've been on a month to month for a while.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.040]   And so nothing's changing.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.680]   They're just simply saying they're not willing
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.280]   to be tied down into a longer relationship.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.680]   What would a record company do though?
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.960]   Would they just say, okay, you cancel our stuff anymore?
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.720]   And are we off iTunes?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.640]   But I think they want some leverage.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.160]   That's so counterproductive.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.920]   That seems so dumb.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.840]   Well, the company they've been making is not inconsiderable.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.760]   I mean, it isn't like they have the leverage to just say,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.520]   well, we're gonna show you, you can't carry our stuff anymore.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.760]   That just sounds crazy to me.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   I think that what they're trying to do
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.040]   is get some kind of leverage in the thing.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.080]   Once they sign a contract with Apple,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.720]   there's not another conversation they can have
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   for another year or two.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.520]   So they're in the contract.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.360]   They're in the relationship.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.720]   I think they probably get better prices on the songs
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.120]   when they're in a longer-term contract.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.720]   But I think that they wanna be able to say,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.960]   we like to come back and talk about this every month
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   because they're really concerned
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   that they're losing control and they're right.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.560]   And it's the big, from what I've been hearing,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   the big concern is the lack of flexibility in pricing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.920]   That they wanna see higher prices on more recent hits.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.760]   Is that the kind of thing?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.080]   - Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.960]   that the record labels have wanted for a while.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.480]   And maybe they just don't like the idea being digital.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.120]   I mean, I think there's still some discomfort
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.800]   with the idea of putting music online.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.680]   What even though it's got DRM.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.800]   - I think what they're really concerned about
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.680]   is they don't like the idea of being digital
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.200]   and having only one reseller be 80% of the market.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.800]   And that reseller being someone
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.400]   who just tells them the way it's gonna be.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   - But talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.840]   I mean, if you pull yourself off iTunes,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.400]   you're basically saying, steal this song.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I personally,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.480]   if I don't, I think that if someone doesn't put something
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.320]   up on iTunes, they're just asking for people
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.800]   to go find it somewhere else.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.680]   - You know, the other side of this conversation is
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.520]   they take it, you know, they take it pretty hard
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.040]   from Walmart and places like that.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.760]   They do whatever Walmart tells them to do
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.360]   because that's the largest physical retailer.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.320]   If they think they're gonna set the rules at iTunes,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.520]   they better be prepared to try to do it at Walmart.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.120]   It's just stupid if you're looking at the revenue
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.080]   they take in from this relationship.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.200]   There's no way, I mean, Steve Jobs knows they're just bluffing
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   'cause they're walking away from millions of dollars
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.920]   if they say no.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.040]   - iTunes is big enough now that it's really one of the,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.880]   it's like in the top five, right?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   - Number three.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.920]   - Of all retailers.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.120]   - And catching up the other two.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.120]   I mean, I think it would be totally reasonable
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.560]   to think that Apple could move to number two next year
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.680]   and number one by 2009.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   - Well, that's where I buy all my music.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.800]   I'm not crazy about the DRM, but, you know,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   it's the devil you gotta deal with.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.200]   There are other choices.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.120]   In fact, I keep getting these cryptic mail.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.440]   It'll happen tomorrow if it happens.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.080]   I've mentioned it on Twitter,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.040]   I haven't mentioned it elsewhere.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.200]   It's llama mail.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.480]   Anybody getting llama mail?
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.280]   It's handwritten letters with--
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.120]   - From llama.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.960]   - Well, they've got a little llama stamp on it
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.000]   and then I got a origami llama and all the early mail
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.560]   kept doing is pointing to a website.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   The end is the beginning.org.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.680]   - Buzz marketing.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.960]   - It's very good buzz marketing,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.760]   but now I see it's a music deal.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.920]   And now I remember that Win Amps all about llamas, right?
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.960]   So I just got, and I know it's gonna happen tomorrow
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.240]   'cause they're talking about 747.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.640]   And I just got the declaration of musical independence.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.800]   - Winamp, huh?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640]   That'll be great.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.480]   That'll work great on your Zoom phone.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   (laughing)
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.880]   - The major record labels have over,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.680]   well, it's from the, I think it's from the Winamp people,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.040]   but remember they didn't does just do Winamp,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.720]   they did Nutella.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.560]   - Yeah.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.400]   - There peer to peer to peer people.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.480]   Here's the facts.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.080]   The major record labels have overcharged the public
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.600]   for years demanding huge margins
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.240]   and earning massive profits.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.600]   They've used their effective monopoly
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.960]   to demand and secure contracts blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.600]   It sounds like it's gonna be an alternative.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.840]   We therefore, the representatives of music thing
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   and signers of this declaration
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.000]   are solemnly publishing declare
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.240]   the status quo to be absurd, unacceptable,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.040]   and no longer in the best interests of the,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.560]   so I don't know what this is gonna be,
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.080]   but it's gonna probably launch tomorrow.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.920]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.640]   I hope they support Max.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.240]   I'll tell you, I think they do because
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.280]   all of the marketing has people with iPods
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.720]   and llamas on the iPods.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.600]   I'm thinking they're doing an alternative
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.120]   to the iTunes store.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.280]   That's really worked well for everybody else.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.400]   But I mean four iPods.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.320]   - That's interesting.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.840]   Well, you know, that's the thing though, is,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   personally I wouldn't mind seeing iTunes
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.840]   as much as I love iTunes.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.920]   I wouldn't mind seeing them get some competition
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.240]   that encourages them to keep doing the right thing.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.080]   - Exactly.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.920]   I mean, if you're an op-el--
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.760]   - That kind of monopoly.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.520]   Oh, you see it happen in, I mean, God bless them,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   starting to happen with Google
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.040]   where you're kind of like praying
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.320]   that somebody's gonna come along
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.720]   and give these guys a run for their money
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   in at least one piece of what they do
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   so that that keeps them on track
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.440]   and improving the experience for the customer.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   - Go to the end as the beginning of that org.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.440]   There's a picture of Mark Twain with an iPod on it.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.400]   Saying everybody talks about the music business
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.560]   but nobody does anything about it.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.480]   I think this might be interesting.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.640]   - Now, can you actually get,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.240]   can they actually put songs into the,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.440]   can you sync the songs with the iPods
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.400]   so that you could play them back
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.360]   and find them on the iPod?
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.560]   I don't know, I think that's something
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   that iTunes does alone, doesn't it?
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   You have to go through iTunes in some way.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.000]   - There is, so a Linux, you can read
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.400]   the declaration of music lin depends
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.480]   at musicthing.org by the way.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.880]   There is an application for Linux
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.400]   that will sync the iPod.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.280]   It's just like iTunes, it's the only choice
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.360]   if you're an Linux user.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.240]   - Maybe they're doing something
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.360]   that would allow you to do that.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.200]   - Sign, I can't read these signatures.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.360]   It looks like Rob Drew.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.200]   - And the llama.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.600]   - And then, and then, and then.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.680]   - Maybe we'll eventually hear from the llama lope.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.280]   - The llama lope.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.720]   - Thank you, congratulations to the mackerelope,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.080]   by the way, forget it, just ain't snagging a real job.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.360]   - Yeah, I'd say, hearty congratulations.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.200]   - Lose knowledge. - But you know,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.600]   - Street cred, but that's it.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.040]   - Well, who cares about street cred?
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.120]   That $1.50, you'll buy you a cup of coffee at 57 and 11.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   - Good.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.880]   Go to the slash images directory of musicthing.org.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.480]   - Oh, you are, see, you're a hacker at heart.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.120]   - Yeah, I'm really good at adding slashes to URL.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.320]   - Slash images. - Slash images.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.400]   - Three images in there.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.680]   - They've got the image of some little kids.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.920]   - PayPal.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.280]   - Yeah, and they got a PayPal button.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.320]   - And the share, I have that on my card.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.400]   See, remember what was nice to share?
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.200]   There's something going on.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.040]   I don't know what it is.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.120]   - Notice that the MT instead of TM,
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.120]   along the lots of copy left.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.600]   - Well, or musicthing.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.680]   - Oh, look at you, okay, I got it.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.880]   - Oh, there's something interesting.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.520]   - Something, you know, they did this obviously on purpose.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.680]   They put that PayPal logo there, so.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.280]   - Welcome to speculation, Brick.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.760]   - You know, I just, maybe it's just nothing,
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.600]   but they sure got me with this campaign.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   I've been getting mail from these people for months.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.920]   - USPS mail or what?
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.760]   - In my post office box.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.600]   - Wow.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   - I thought, and it's handwritten from LA.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.920]   And it's been very cryptic,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.000]   but now it's starting to make sense.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.160]   Tomorrow's the day, we'll find out.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.600]   - Whatever their mark, as it was a fact,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.080]   'cause we've been talking about it for the last time.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.120]   - It's worked, well, yeah, I'm the only one,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.080]   but it's worked for me.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.440]   I think they figured out, we'll just send the letters to--
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.240]   - He'll mention it, he's an idiot.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.440]   - If you frustrate Leo, he'll go on.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.960]   - Yeah, talk about it.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.800]   - What the hell is this?
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.280]   - What is this?
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.920]   - I just, maybe I'm over, maybe I'm stretching here,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.240]   but I'm hoping that'll be something to compete with iTunes,
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.080]   you know?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.600]   Did you guys, I guess, participate's the wrong word,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.240]   but the internet music blackout?
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.520]   - I totally didn't, I was so bad.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   I remember it was about 11 a.m. before I realized,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.240]   I've been listening to the 1920's station for two hours.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.720]   I was like, "Ooh, I screwed up!"
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.240]   (laughs)
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.680]   Which, by the way, is the best thing
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.560]   in the iTunes streaming, by the way.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.280]   People heard the 1920's station, and people were saying,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.440]   "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.120]   You gotta go to a eclectic, under the iTunes radio area.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.960]   - Oh, it's great.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.200]   - And it's all like crazy music from the '20s.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.280]   - But apparently they didn't shut down.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.120]   - No.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.960]   - I didn't do it.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.160]   - And thousands of it, well, it wasn't just,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   it was the stations that we're supposed to--
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.000]   - What about you Scott?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.280]   - You're like the Thomas Edison in this crap.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.360]   - He's the guy who started it all with net radio.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   I did not participate in terms of I didn't listen to any music,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.240]   I usually listen to Pandora and I didn't.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.680]   And no, the idea was that the radio stations
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.920]   would shut down and then you would get in touch with Congress
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.480]   because you know, we're only a week away
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.320]   from this deadline or two weeks away from this deadline.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.040]   - It's actually my Congressman who's behind the bill,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.240]   so I've been in touch with him for months.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.480]   And I've motivated him in the way
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.720]   that you can motivate politicians most with a check.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.640]   I'm completely behind.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.760]   - I thought you were gonna say a picture of a hooker.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.600]   - No, no, no.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   - I'm completely behind the effort and I think
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.120]   if it doesn't succeed, there is no internet radio business.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.280]   I don't care what anybody says,
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.040]   you just, I know the numbers in this business,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.560]   you can't make it work with the kind of money that they want.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.040]   - Yeah, you're actually, that's just true,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.960]   you speak with a lot of authority.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.560]   - For what?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.640]   - Yeah, no.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.000]   Savenetradio.org, the place to go to find out more about this
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.080]   and it's not too late, but you should write to your member
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.960]   of Congress today because it's just a couple of the deadlines,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.840]   July 15th.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.080]   And that's what's really funny about this Leo is back
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.960]   when I started Net Radio in the mid 90s,
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.880]   I called AsCap CSAC and BMI to get licenses.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.120]   - Is it what?
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.760]   - And only CSAC worked with me on it,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.920]   a guy named Bennett Linkoff, I'll never forget him,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.200]   he's like the only nice music lawyer I've ever met.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.680]   But the guys at BMI and CSAC, they were like,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.600]   yeah, whatever, we don't care, man.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   (laughs)
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.040]   - Yeah, they care now.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.880]   - They do.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.920]   - They didn't figure it out at the time, they had no idea.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   They thought, ah, this will never go anywhere.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.760]   - I think that with universal, you know, saying,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   we're gonna pull the plug and I think a lot of people
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.880]   not liking the DRM on iTunes, this is a good time.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.800]   - Well, you know, Prince has given his music away
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.440]   with a newspaper. - Is that great?
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.200]   - And did you see the record labels response to that?
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.960]   - It wasn't the labels, it was the retailers.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.400]   The retailers are going crazy.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.320]   The retailers in the UK are just freaking out.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.240]   And to the backstory, I guess, it's the daily,
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.400]   is that right, the daily?
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.240]   - Yeah, the Daily Mail.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.080]   - Daily Mail.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.920]   - The Daily Mail.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.760]   I think it's the Daily Mail that's distributing it.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.560]   I think it's, is it this Sunday or was it last Sunday?
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.960]   It was two days ago, that they're distributing
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   the entire app.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.720]   My guess Prince's, his negotiations with his label
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.680]   or whatever label he was gonna work with didn't go through.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.480]   And so I guess this was the next round
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.320]   of what he can do with it.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.040]   - Somebody said he's gonna be the artist formerly known
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.080]   as a recording artist if he keeps this up.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.680]   (laughing)
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.640]   - Dailymail.co.uk if you wanna know about it.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.080]   It'll be the 15th of July.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.000]   A lot of artists are starting to go this way.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.680]   I mean, Thomas Dolby, you know, there are folks out there
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.240]   who are deciding they don't wanna pretend
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   to be part of any of this craziness.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.120]   But there is a point to be made.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.320]   I mean, he's giving this CD away to who knows
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.720]   how many millions of people and they're not gonna buy it.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.960]   - He's not giving it away free.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.400]   It's a promotional with the newspaper.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   So he's probably getting paid somewhere between--
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   - He is getting paid.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.680]   - Okay.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.840]   - He's getting paid for it.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.040]   - Yeah, he's getting paid.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.880]   - Oh, it's the same, if you forgive the pun,
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.240]   the same tune we always have heard,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.520]   which is that like we've said all along,
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   these changes, at least in my opinion,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.520]   are not going to damage the artist nearly as much
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.000]   as they damage the labels.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.240]   The labels are the ones that are gonna take a hit on this.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.680]   They're the ones who are fronting all the money
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   in a lot of this.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.080]   But if I was gonna go to the mattresses,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.440]   it would not be against Prince,
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.880]   'cause that has a loose cannon with this stuff.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.760]   He'll do whatever, you know?
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.360]   - He doesn't need the money anymore.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.080]   He's in all that respect.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.280]   - Yeah, I really do.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   - I mean, he's a guy who changes name to a symbol
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.120]   to prove a point.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.960]   - Right.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.520]   - No, I think-- - Fairly also,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.880]   that means of distribution is apparently not unique.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.160]   I'm copying here, I read this off MetaFilter
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.520]   when the story first came out.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.760]   But folks in England were saying,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.320]   it's not unusual at all to give away,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.200]   you know, more like maybe the compilation CDs
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.000]   or holiday CDs or whatever inside a newspaper.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.240]   It's not something we do a lot here,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.840]   but apparently it's fairly common over there.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.120]   It's not as common, I guess,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.600]   for somebody at Prince's stature to do it.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   But it's interesting, 'cause I mean,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.360]   he's taking a channel that the people have done that with
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.640]   and doing something pretty wild.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.880]   - Well, I think he's not too worried
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.520]   about making the retailers upset
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.960]   because they're not, you know,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.640]   they're kind of on the very low end
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.400]   of the food chain at this point.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.040]   - You know, I think that for most retailers
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.440]   that are selling CDs and stuff like that,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.240]   unless they augment their market,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.720]   they're not gonna be around for another,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.560]   you know, they maybe have another 10 years.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.680]   - Well, let's switch gears from audio to video.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   Download to DVD is expected to be an option
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   both on cinema now and on the iTunes music store
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.600]   sometime soon.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.720]   Movies that you buy on the iTunes music store,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.600]   you'll be able to burn.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.960]   This is something that actually has been worked on
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   by the Motion Picture Association,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.520]   the DVD Copy Control Association.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.120]   I guess figured out some way to control this.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.880]   Is this something everybody wants?
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.120]   I don't think I'd really wanna burn
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.280]   this low quality video to DVD.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.200]   If I'm gonna do that, I just wanna burn it to my DVD
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.040]   and then I'm gonna rip it.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.680]   - And you have to buy a special disc.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.600]   Doesn't work with all DVD burners.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.560]   - I've got a pretty up-to-date Mac
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.520]   and I was really excited when I got my Mac Pro
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.920]   'cause I thought, okay, this is it.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.880]   It's finally gonna be really fast for me to burn DVDs.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.760]   And it's not like burning a CD, that's for sure.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.520]   I would burn a CD, what's that stupid format
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.760]   that's real popular in Asia?
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.600]   CD?
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.440]   - CD.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.000]   I would burn like an SVCD before I would burn a DVD.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.400]   I mean, first of all, they're more costly,
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   they take forever to burn.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.480]   - Well, an SVCD would be the right quality level
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.760]   for the crap you're downloading.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.600]   - That's right.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.720]   I mean, me, I'm going the other way.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.680]   I mean, I want stuff on my Apple TV.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.840]   - I want hi-dish. - Yeah, okay.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.040]   Yeah, exactly, sure.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.800]   But I mean, we wanted to watch a wire the other night.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.600]   It's like, oh God, I haven't ripped this one.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.440]   I've got to go get the DVD out.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.800]   It was such a pain.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.600]   - You just want to have it all on your...
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.160]   You know, I killed my Apple TV, I've been hacking it.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.720]   - Oh no, did you get a brick?
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.560]   Did you brick it?
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.920]   - Well, I think I can get it back.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.040]   You know, first thing I was going to upgrade it
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.080]   to 120 gig hard drive.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.160]   So you image the original, I have the original drive intact.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   I have the image of it, so I can always go back.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.400]   But I'm trying to get a bigger drive
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.880]   and I'm trying to put SSH on there
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   so I can log into it and do all these hacks to it.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.360]   - Weak knees, Leo, weak knees.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.680]   Do they sell a drive, you just pop in?
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.880]   - Dude, I think you can, I'm chucked right now,
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.240]   I think you can send it to them.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.120]   - No, but Apple is announcing that tomorrow
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.040]   you can buy the 120 gig version at the Apple store.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.320]   - But I'm not going to do that.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   I just want to pop in, you know, anyway,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.240]   it's an easy thing to do.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.720]   - You want to do it because you can.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.240]   You want to be able to do shell stuff.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   - But still learn this kind of stuff
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.400]   and I want to give a shell into it and that's what I do.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.360]   So anyway, you know, something went wrong.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.400]   But yeah, you learn this stuff, that's how you learn it.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.240]   And I'll work it out.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.080]   - Yeah, they do it.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.880]   - You can talk stack about the Apple TV, but I love mine.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.240]   I still, I love it.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.880]   Here's another example though of a product,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.280]   the Apple product that didn't, hasn't really taken off,
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   but I think for the right audience, it's fantastic.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.960]   - Yeah.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.800]   - I love it.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.960]   I don't see any reason why I want DVDs.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.240]   When we look at this burning to DVD,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.560]   I'm just like, oh, I'm just happy about it.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.640]   - Well, the trick is to get the high quality video on there,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   but that's, you got to be able to download it
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.480]   and convert it.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.320]   Visual Hub is great for that.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.680]   I look at where to write to the iTunes.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.560]   So, a weeknies is selling a replacement 160 gig drive,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   professionally installed 149 bucks,
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.880]   but they also sell the $400 160 gig Apple TV.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.920]   So if you already have one, let's see, you paid 300.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.640]   So it'd be cheaper to, if you haven't bought one,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.920]   be cheaper to buy a big one already,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.360]   but if you already have one, you could upgrade it.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.200]   I'm just doing it, right?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.440]   Was it 100 bucks to get a new drive?
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.280]   It was cheap.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.640]   I just have to do all the little finicky bits.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.880]   - Did a two and a half inch drive?
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.720]   - Yeah.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.040]   - You have a tough drive.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.120]   It's not, it's slow,
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.520]   'cause you're imaging the drive using DD from the shell,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.720]   and it takes eight hours to image the drive.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.560]   (laughs)
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.720]   It takes a long time.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.240]   You just gotta go home.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.080]   - DD is that Mac only shell.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.920]   - I think it's a good X-Command, actually.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.760]   - Oh, it's Unix?
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.600]   I thought it was Mac, okay.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.440]   - Is it?
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.280]   - I know what you're talking about.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.760]   There's one that copies the resource for.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.080]   - Or Ditto, I'm thinking of Ditto.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.680]   - Ditto is the, yeah, that's the one
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.880]   that copies the research for.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   I think DD's been around a long time.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.320]   It's a disk imaging program.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   Ditto, it's stump data, I think is what it stands for.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.680]   - It's amazing how many technologies
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.160]   I one quarter understand.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.360]   - Well, what's neat about,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.000]   and this is one of the things I love about the Mac,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.880]   is under the hood, you've got this power, you've got Yudix.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.760]   So you've got these commands like DD just lying around.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.080]   I mean, one of the way you put the shell onto the Apple TV
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.600]   is you copy SSH, the SSH demon, SSHD,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   from your Apple, where it lives,
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   don't tell you it to your Apple TV.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.400]   And it's still at OS 10, so it works.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.000]   And then you change the boot commands
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.360]   just as you win Unix, it's very Unix-y.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.840]   And I either screwed up the boot commands
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.320]   or more likely I screwed up the drive format, so.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.640]   I'll fix it.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.040]   It's fun, I like doing this stuff.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.080]   It's just, the reason it's a pain is
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.440]   'cause it takes eight hours each time
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.280]   you wanna re-image the drive.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.080]   It's kind of a long, long drawn out kind of process.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.920]   - Just do you just have to,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.200]   you get an hour to test it before you go to bed.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.080]   - Yeah. - And then you do it.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.000]   - And then you, exactly.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.520]   Then you have to go back and,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.640]   the thing is I'm doing it at the office.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.200]   I should bring it home and do it.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.960]   - That'd be easier.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.480]   Let's see, there is, is there any leopard news
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.000]   to talk about, any Mac news?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.320]   I hear rumors that this pinch touchscreen interface
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.720]   might be coming out on a new MacBook Pro
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.840]   that will be one half the width
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.440]   of the existing MacBook Pros sometime in the fall.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   - You pranking me.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.880]   - No.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.720]   - For real?
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.040]   - That's the rumor.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.880]   - Ow.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   - Let me see where I can find that rumor.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.120]   (laughing)
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.680]   I mean, I don't read, the truth is I no longer
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.120]   paying the attention to Mac rumors
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.840]   'cause I don't think anybody has even Scott Born really,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.880]   maybe Scott, but nobody besides Scott,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.160]   even the Macelope, doesn't really know
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.680]   what's going on inside one infinite loop.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.120]   I don't even think Steve Jobs knows
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.800]   what's going on inside one of the loops
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.160]   - Yeah, you get right, Encyclopaedia is about
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.480]   what I don't know what's going on inside one infinite loop.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.800]   - I think rumors are pretty much not trustworthy.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.200]   Although, when rumors--
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.040]   - I think that's accurate.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.880]   - Yeah.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.960]   - Look at their track record
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.920]   and you can see most of these rumor sites,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.480]   you know, they're, I'm sure they're publishing
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.360]   what they think to be true, but they're just often wrong.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.200]   - Yeah.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.480]   - It's like publishing a gambler's tip sheet though.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.600]   You don't need to be right.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   You know, you need to be right.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.880]   - It's true, the source tip sheets, yep.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.720]   - Yeah.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.280]   - Well, unlike everyone who seems to think
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.920]   that all of us in the world have evil intent,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.720]   I don't think these guys have evil intent.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.200]   I just think they're wrong.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.280]   - No, I think that somebody said to them,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.200]   "Hey, you know," and they said, "Oh,"
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.680]   and they publish it.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.560]   Hey, coming up on Friday,
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.360]   the iPhone Developers Conference,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   I know Scott, you're part of that.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   - We're sponsoring it.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.200]   - It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.040]   - Is it almost at first Friday or--
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.560]   - Is it almost at first Friday or--
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.480]   - Is it just Friday or is it Thursday or Friday?
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.200]   - It's Friday, Sunday, Sunday.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.040]   - Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.080]   - Is it gonna focus on developing for Safari
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.840]   or something more?
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.720]   - It's gonna develop, yeah, they're gonna talk about Safari
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.280]   and, you know, the actual approved stuff.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.680]   - Approved SDK.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.640]   - Yeah, it's not a hackers conference.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   It's like, let's see what we can do with what they give us.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   And we're giving away an iPhone as part of the contest there
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.520]   to all the developers that participate
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   have a chance to win that,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.040]   along with numerous other prizes.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.360]   There's a bunch of sponsors now, Adobe's,
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.280]   here's what's interesting.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.200]   It's being held at Adobe's Macromedia Campus.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.040]   - That's interesting.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.560]   I'd love to see Air on the iPhone.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.080]   - So you have to ask yourself the question.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.920]   Now, why did Adobe agree?
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.560]   - Considering it doesn't support Flash
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.440]   or any other Adobe technology.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   - Exactly.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   (laughing)
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.560]   Yeah, that's correct.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.920]   - I think it's 'cause we're finally gonna be able
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.560]   to have Photoshop on our phone.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.300]   (laughing)
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.080]   That's scratching an itch.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.280]   - Scott's gonna be mad at me.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.160]   I went out and bought Lightroom instead of Aperture.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.000]   - I'm not mad at you.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.320]   I think Lightroom's a fine product.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.920]   I, for each person, there's, you know,
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.160]   it's like there's no perfect product for everybody.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.480]   Some people, that's a good thing.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.600]   - I wanted to end it Adobe.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.320]   I did, so we bought, I bought Jennifer a Canon 5D.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.160]   - Very nice.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.840]   - I thought for her, oh, it's a great camera.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.960]   But I thought for her,
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.880]   'cause she's Photoshop's way over her head.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.560]   I thought Lightroom would be a good start,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.920]   starting point for her to do simple adjustments and so forth.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.120]   - Just be careful with the glass on that camera now, Leo.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.960]   - Oh, it's expensive glass.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.440]   - When I get the good glass because--
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.960]   - Oh, I did, I got the L lens.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.160]   - Yeah, you have to use nothing but L lenses
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.080]   'cause you've got a whole lot of resolution problems.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.400]   Actually, the thing that's interesting about this,
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.240]   from a complete rat hole perspective,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.120]   is that the ability of the sensor in that camera
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.000]   to resolve horizontal line pairs
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.240]   actually exceeds the ability of most lenses to deliver them.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.320]   - Were you kidding?
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.200]   - No.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.920]   - But the L lenses can handle it.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.080]   - The L lenses can handle it.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.160]   - Yeah, no, somebody told, a number of photographers told me
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.080]   just stay with the L, L stands for luxury,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.560]   L should stand for losing all the money
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.080]   in your savings account, it is very expensive,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.640]   but they're nice lenses.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   - That's the red stripe on the Canon lens.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.120]   - Yeah, oh boy.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.720]   - Yeah, I'm excited, I don't know, it was pricey,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.160]   but the image I've seen coming off this thing
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.840]   are so stunning.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   It's a great case.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.600]   - And my wife's a very good photographer,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.320]   and I thought she deserved a better camera.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.280]   - She must be a serious photographer then.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.520]   - She's pretty serious, but she's been shooting a film
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.280]   at OM1 film.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.200]   - Oh gee.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.000]   - And I said, you know, honey.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.960]   - You really, but she watched that kind of film experience,
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.600]   and I think that that's the nice thing about the 5D.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.920]   The only bad thing is it's big.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.440]   It's heavy, once you put the flash on it in the lens,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.480]   that's, she's a little girl, it's a big camera.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.320]   - You were not talking point and shooting no more.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.960]   - Ah, that's an awfully big camera for such a little girl.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.000]   (laughing)
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.840]   Bye bye.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.200]   - I'm a big anti, I think I don't even know
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.640]   if the flash works on my Canon.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.680]   - Well, this doesn't have a, the interesting thing
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.880]   about the 5D doesn't come with a flash.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.360]   You have to buy a speed light.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.560]   - I think mine's actually broken,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   I think I actually opened it for something like
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.200]   a couple months ago and realized it wasn't working
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.800]   anymore. - You don't use it.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.640]   - I never used it.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   - There's an interesting thing, a little diffuser
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.520]   that somebody showed me that goes,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   you point the, first of all, it's a bounce flash,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.480]   which is nice, you can point it up instead of the pop up flash.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.440]   So you can at least bounce it, and that helps.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.800]   But if you point it straight up, there's this diffuser.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.720]   It looks like a lamp shell, glass lamp shade.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.280]   - You can be speaking about the Fong Lights Sphere.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.880]   - It's amazing.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   - That's what you're describing.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.400]   The Fong, like fear made by Gary Fong,
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.680]   well-known Los Angeles wedding photographer.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.520]   And I have one of those right here in front of me.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.320]   - It's pretty, it's pretty amazing what it does.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.560]   I mean, it really diffuses all that harsh light
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.160]   that you get from flash, and it means
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.520]   that you've got good lighting.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.480]   But-- - I'll tell you what,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.080]   that's like the $40 secret to the best pictures
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.920]   you'll ever take.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.120]   - It makes a huge difference.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.000]   If you don't know squat about lighting ratios
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.520]   or any of that kind of stuff, get the Fong Lights Sphere,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.280]   throw it on your flash, and all of a sudden,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.000]   you'll look like a superstar.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.960]   - Mm.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.640]   Well, I feel good that I've discovered this all by myself.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   - I'm glad you're out of your--
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.040]   Actually, I didn't, somebody showed it to me,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.600]   but it's pretty amazing.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.800]   Pretty amazing.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.760]   - Did you get the white one or the clear one, Leo?
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.720]   - I haven't ordered it yet, but which one do you recommend?
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.520]   - She had the white one, and it looked really good.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.160]   - The white one is the one that I prefer,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.560]   but the clear one works well too.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.560]   - Yeah, and I got the 430 EX flash strobe for the cannon,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.360]   so it fits that, so it should work pretty well.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.560]   I'm excited.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.280]   - I'm excited. - You're in combat.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.200]   It's a little more camera than I can handle,
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.320]   but I'm hoping she will grow into it.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.800]   Now that was a rat hole.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.440]   I think for that, I think we need to really kind of
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   step up here.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.440]   At least it wasn't iPhone.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   Yeah, it doesn't make us--
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   - It's kind of an anti rat hole.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.440]   But you know, actually it was about light room,
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.440]   which runs on a Mac.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   - Yeah, no, no, it was a Mac topic.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   I'm not saying that.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   - I'm not saying that.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   - I'm not saying that.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440]   - I'm not about Prince uses a Mac.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   - Does Prince use a Mac?
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.440]   - You know, don't you think Prince would use a Mac?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   - I would bet he uses a Mac.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   - I think I'm gonna bet he uses an Amiga.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   - Well, that would be sweet.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   - Don't you, yeah, see what I'm saying?
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   Cool, I mean, that's the height of cool, right?
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   - Oh yeah, I use an Amiga.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440]   - Probably got a computer he made himself out of velvet.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   - A little bit computer.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   - Speaking of computers that you made yourself,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.440]   did you see the link I posted to the complete chart of the Apple?
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.440]   - Oh, that was really good.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.440]   I saw it.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440]   - Apple evolution chart?
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440]   - It's so pretty.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   - I'd love to put this out.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.440]   - Can you buy this as a poster?
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   - Yeah, I don't know, but we need to put that in the show notes
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   so people can see it.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   - I'm not sure.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440]   - We need to put that in the show notes so people can see it,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440]   'cause that is really cool.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   - We will, we have a new show note guy,
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   'cause John Foster quit in the huff.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   You know why he quit?
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   - I can't imagine why.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   - I'll tell you why.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   He wasn't putting in links to any rumor sites that we mentioned,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.440]   so if we mentioned something from a rumor site,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   he just wouldn't put it in.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   And I said, "Well, I appreciate that, John.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're doing the show notes.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   I just want to let you know.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   I just really love that.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   Thank you."
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   And I like this, you know, he's adding some personality and style to it.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   But I have to say the whole point of the show notes is to put links in
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   of all the stuff we mentioned.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   And he said, "Oh, all right, I'll try."
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   And then he sends me an email the next day and said, "I couldn't do it."
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   He said, "I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   I can't glue these links."
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   Isn't that funny?
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   - So who's our new show note taker?
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   - I'm looking up his name right now.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   He's a nice kid who volunteered to do it for us.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   Well, I'm paying him, but a pittance.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.440]   His name is Alex Gishet.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   And I think he's a high school student.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   He does a great job.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   And he doesn't mind including rumor links.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   Your track record with high school students is pretty good.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   I tell you, I've been monitoring Shub.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   - He's jy-soo.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   - Shub be amazing.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   Let me tell you that kid is scary, smart.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   - You know, he's interns here.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   - Oh, he's working for you too?
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   - Yeah, he works for you.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   - He's working for Justin TV, Pixel 4.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   - And me.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.440]   - He's spinning around.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   - He's right in the middle of it all.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   And he does great work here.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.440]   I mean, he really--
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   - He's a smart kid.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   - Well--
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.440]   - Very, very effective.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   - I'll tell you what happens.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.440]   I can't take credit as these people find us.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.440]   They listen to Twit and they're very involved.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.440]   And I can tell over time we have many, many volunteers who help this show and help the
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   podcast network.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   And I'm very grateful.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   - Did you see that he had the, when he was standing, I guess there was a whole issue when he was
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   in line.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   There was a little, there were some kids in Palo Alto that were messing with him.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   - Why?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:11.080]   - I don't know why they were messing with him, but I thought that he was up here at the Apple
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   store and I was going to go down and--
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.000]   - Yeah, we should have known about that, Alex.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We could have taken care of that.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   - Well, I was like, yeah, I have a very quick way of handling this.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.440]   - Were they messing with him physically or what were they doing?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   - I think they were threatening to mess with him physically.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   - He was in a shepherd.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   - You look at Shubie and you don't think that he'd be like--
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   - He's a black belt.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   - Oh, man.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   - They better not mess with him.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   - He's like, oh, come on, guy.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440]   - That's what I was expecting.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   - Yeah.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.940]   - And when I watch it, it's on Justin TV.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.440]   Like if you go to the archives or whatever.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   - Oh, okay.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.240]   - He's coming right back at him like, what do you want to do?
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   What do you want to do?
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   - He's a martial artist.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.760]   - He can break bricks with his hand.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.640]   I've seen him do it.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.560]   They don't want to mess with Shubie, trust me.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.640]   He's very-- he looks like just a kind of skinny kid.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   - He's the nicest kid in the world.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.440]   - And he's so nice.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   - It was so funny to see him like really--
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   - He's jealous because he's--
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.360]   - You know, pushing these guys back like layoff, man.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   You know, and it was--
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.760]   - It was America's favorite high school junior.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   I was like, that's-- that's--
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.160]   - You know, if I had a 14 year old kid, you know, I would want him to be like Shubie.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   I mean, he's perfect.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   - Okay.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   - He's 16, but okay.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   - Or 16, sorry.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.960]   - He was 14 when I met him, sorry.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.200]   - That's the new-- by the way, that's going to be the newest show on the NBC primetime schedule
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   in the fall.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   That's our Shubie.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   (laughter)
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.360]   - I thought it was going to be I bought a 14 year old.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.840]   - No, no, no.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.960]   I don't want any rumors here.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.800]   Shubie works far, far away from me.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   - I don't--
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   - That kid is wired.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:42.920]   He's a great example of how old and confused I am because he's updating more than I'm like
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   doing anything.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.240]   Like he's getting so much done and he's like--
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.400]   - He's like an A plus student, AP everything.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.880]   - I'm surprised you.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.200]   - He's over here working on shows.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.160]   I found my software pick of the week as a result of him.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   - Oh, all right.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   - This is now the Shubie show.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   (laughter)
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.320]   - You know, we're trying to talk about something other than you know what.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.440]   So I know it is so hard.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   It's really--
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.000]   - It's the elephant in the room.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Yes, Shubie got an iPhone.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   - You did get one.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Okay.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   - Yeah, it's the elephant in the room.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.960]   Let's talk briefly about hacking the iPhone.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.240]   A couple of new stories about that.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   Somebody's cracked the iPhone root password.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.160]   - Yeah, I don't know what that means.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   - Yeah, that's the word.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   - Hackintosh.org.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.280]   - Yeah, they haven't been able to get anything happening with getting anything installed,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.360]   but they were able to crack the password.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   - I think we may be--
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   I mean, there's a lot of people working very hard to crack this.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.760]   They've pulled the sim chip.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.040]   Turns out the sim chip would work in another phone, by the way.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   - Another AT&T phone.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040]   - Yeah.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.640]   - Well, any phone, if it's unlocked, it becomes an AT&T phone when you put the sim chip in it.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   - Right.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   That's what I mean.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.640]   It'll become an AT&T phone.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.080]   - Somebody else, and I don't recommend this procedure, says you buy a pay as you go,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.880]   plan, which you can do.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.200]   I didn't know this with the iPhone.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.440]   Cancel it immediately, but we got to activate it before you could do anything with the iPhone.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.720]   It's a brick until you activate it.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.160]   You can only make emergency calls, but once you activate it, you can then cancel that account,
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.360]   pop the sim chip or put a dummy sim chip in, and it will continue to operate as an iPod.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.920]   It's an expensive procedure to get an expensive iPod, but you--
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.360]   - You still have Wi-Fi, and you still have--
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   - Right.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   - But everything other than being able to connect to the data or be able to make phone calls.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.880]   - I have a feeling, though, that you could do this in tomorrow Apple could push an update
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.520]   that would kill it, so.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   - I guess--
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.360]   - I have to admit, it was kind of tempting when I looked at it.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.240]   I was like, "Well, 'cause I don't really--"
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.720]   But then I started realizing that I kind of liked the idea of being able to--
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.960]   I like-- I mean, I've now been getting some phone calls, and I like being able to walk down
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   the street, and I get the phone call, and I click on the little thing on my headphone,
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.480]   and I answer it, and back to what I'm doing.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.640]   - I hate to admit it, but it's really growing on me.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.000]   The more I use it, the more I like it.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.880]   I mean, there's still those glaring things missing, but I'm confident Apple will add third-party
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.040]   support and other stuff, and meanwhile, it's still a pretty good phone.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.960]   - I mean, the biggest thing I'm wrestling with with the iPhone is mostly my anti-socialness
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.960]   now, because I just--
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   - Yeah, 'cause they're sealed in.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.000]   - Oh, I wear the headphones everywhere.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.760]   - Well, it's not only that, it's that I'm just surfing all the time.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   You know, like, I'm just--
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.560]   - You're always gazing at your navel, aka your iPhone.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.400]   - I'm walking down the street, and I'm surfing, I'm on the cable car, and I'm surfing, and
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.080]   you know, I'm waiting for a movie, and I'm surfing, and I don't really have any--
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.120]   - Are you using Edge or using the Google Annette or what--
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.680]   - I'm using Edge when I'm walking on the street.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.800]   I run by, if I'm anywhere near a T-Mobile, I'll use that, because I have a T-Mobile account,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.360]   which especially with the iPhone becomes extremely valuable.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.160]   But the Edge is one of those things, like, I'm not planning to go to YouTube when I'm
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.760]   on Edge, but it really isn't that bad.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.160]   - At least in San Francisco, it may be bad.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.220]   - Well, but when you see like this Verizon wireless, I just got the Verizon wireless
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.640]   Devdo card, the new card, it's five megabits down.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.240]   You could have had that.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   And that's what's--
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.720]   - But I think the cost is really power consumption.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   That's what it sounded like.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   - I understand it.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   They can't do it, I understand.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.520]   - Because I do have to admit that I use it enough that I do have to be awake about
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.000]   charging it every night.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   - Yeah.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   - You definitely have to charge it.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.840]   - You definitely have to charge it every night.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.440]   - I was skeptical because I've had many phones that play music, and I never listen to music
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.840]   on it, and this really is such a good iPod that I actually do use it as an iPod, and
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.980]   then the phone functionality is great because just as you say, Alex, you know, by the way,
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   if you--
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   And I've been using the earbuds.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.660]   I've never used the earbuds ever in my life.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.060]   Use the earbuds that came with an iPhone or an iPod, but I'm using these.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.060]   They're not bad.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.060]   And if you--
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.540]   - And I'm best at my iPhone while you're listening to music, it pauses it, you know.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.540]   - Yeah.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.540]   - Which is--
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.540]   - If you press it twice, it skips to the next song.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.540]   - I know, isn't that cool?
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.900]   - Yeah, I found myself using them too, and I'm looking forward to the next group of accessories.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.620]   Now, Alex, you got a problem, though.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.400]   - Your voicemail message is not in any way, shape, or form believable.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.800]   - What is his voicemail message?
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.240]   - He says, "Well, I don't know how to check my voicemail."
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.280]   Five-year-olds know how to check voicemail.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   Click it.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   - Well, that--
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.880]   - I have two minutes to hold over from the last phone.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   - Hey, I can't--
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.880]   - I don't know if it's--
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.440]   - My own phone was like this thing where I had to go through this process.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.080]   I never actually-- no one's left a message for me yet on my iPhone, so I don't even
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   know how to--
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.040]   - Maybe I can get misterapplephoneshow.com to help me.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   - Yeah?
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.480]   - 'Cause I am having a problem, and I can't figure out if it's me or if it's me or if
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.260]   it's AT&T or if it's the iPhone.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.020]   I recorded a greeting.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.100]   It's kind of an embarrassing greeting.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.300]   Let me play it for you here.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.260]   Hmm, maybe I can't even play it for you.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.620]   - Hi, this is Leo.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.660]   You just called my brand new iPhone.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.580]   Leave a message.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.580]   - That's kind of embarrassing.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.780]   I'd actually like to change that.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.060]   But every time I press record, nothing-- oh, wait a minute.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.060]   Now it's working.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   Never mind.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   You fixed it, Scott.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.060]   Hey.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.780]   - I helped Shuby activate his phone.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.780]   - Hi, this is Leo.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.780]   Leave a message.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.780]   There.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   Now it's got a much nicer message.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   I liked that message.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.780]   That was good.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.780]   - Yeah, Leo.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.780]   Leave a message.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.780]   - That was easy.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   That was easy.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.180]   That was too easy.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   Look at that.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   You do it right on the phone.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.520]   But for a while, for a few days it was working, maybe the AT&T network was a little sluggish
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.820]   with all the new users.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.340]   - Now, Scott, your trick was that you turn the iPhone off and then back on it.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.740]   - Actually, to get Shuby's activated, I think what we did is we turned the phone off.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.900]   We took it off the cradle.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   Turned it back on.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.900]   Put it back on the cradle.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.980]   And that's what did it for him.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.980]   - Interesting.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.460]   You know, there is a reboot procedure for it.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.500]   - You can do that right through iTunes.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.820]   - Oh, you can't-- oh, the restore.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.980]   But I mean, you reboot by what, pressing the big button.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.780]   - And the top button at the same time.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.620]   - And the top button at the same time.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.700]   And I think for people who are having trouble, I've done this a couple of times.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.140]   And I think it does help if you've got hung applications and stuff.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:47.500]   - Well, I spoke with AT&T today and they said as of today, they are unaware of hardly
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.740]   anybody having any more activation issues.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.660]   That should be cleared up down to maybe just a few hundred people.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.660]   - Oh, that's good news.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.740]   - Well, I think that we're also talking about, I mean, it was maybe 1%, 1 or 2%, but 1 or
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   2% of 700,000 people.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.740]   - That's a lot of people.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   - It's a lot of people.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.460]   - It's a lot of-- especially because they're all internet connected, so they're all complaining
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   online.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.100]   - And who can blame?
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.620]   You spend 600 bucks and you can't get the thing to come on.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.620]   I'd be ticked.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.620]   - Well, I was frustrated.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.620]   I didn't get to use it until mine didn't activate.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.460]   I was watching movies at home, but I was so frustrated with it at night because I kept
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.140]   checking it every 10 minutes going, "When is this thing going to come up after our show
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.140]   on Friday?"
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.140]   - Right.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   - And so I just left it at the office.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.580]   It's like, "I don't want to look at it anymore."
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.900]   And then I'm home watching a movie and of course, right at the very end, I checked my
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.580]   mail and I'm told my iPhone's been activated.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.580]   So now I'm at the house and--
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:36.460]   - Do you know, Scott, when it's doing things like recording greetings or the voicemail,
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.740]   that's all done locally and then uploaded to the network.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.460]   Is that how it, we're not really interacting with the network.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.780]   - In my understanding, it's sent via packets or something.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.380]   - Okay, so you are interacting with the network then?
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.060]   - That's my understanding that, you know, if you get too technical pretty quickly and
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.660]   go over my head, but I have spoken a lot with some AT&T engineers and I think that's
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.260]   what I heard them say.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.660]   And if you'd like me to ask, I will.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.500]   - I called AT&T because I wanted to change my voice plan and stuff.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.780]   They were surprisingly polite, cooperative.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:10.220]   I got through fairly quickly, which has not been my experience in the past.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.460]   And I asked them, I said, "It's been pretty busy."
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.620]   They said, "Yeah, it's been really busy.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.620]   A lot of iPhone people."
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.700]   They said, "Yeah."
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.940]   But it hasn't, but they obviously, I mean, they hired 2,000 new employees.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.300]   They obviously were prepared for this in event.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:26.420]   I called them on Monday, which would, I guess, be the worst day I got right through.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.420]   - So that's--
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.380]   - When I called to call, I called Friday night trying to figure out why my phone was taking
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.220]   so long and I got someone on the first ring.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.220]   It was amazing.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.220]   - Yeah, they really--
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.100]   - Yeah, some people got help and some people got screwed and that's just the way it goes.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.700]   I mean, I always said the thing I was most worried about was what was going to happen
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.700]   with AT&T.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:48.060]   And frankly, the real blame doesn't fall on them, but the third-party contractor that
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.220]   they hired to arrange all of this activation, who strangely enough wanted to try to kind
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.580]   of keep their names out of this whole thing.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.580]   - Who were they?
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.580]   - I've got it written down.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   I don't know.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.580]   But it's a company that specializes in that sort of thing.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.580]   - Emergency big time success stories.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.580]   - No, no, this is a company.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:10.740]   No, what I'm saying is they hired a third-party company to actually do the activation.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.660]   And that company is like trying to hide out.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:18.740]   But from what I understand today, and that's if you can believe the AT&T spokesman, that
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.460]   is that most of those issues have been solved.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.300]   And based on the traffic to my site where I was getting lots of complaints about that
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.980]   on Saturday, I got virtually none today.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.140]   People are working on unlocking the iPhone.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:36.780]   Any predictions anybody on how long or if, indeed, they will succeed?
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.620]   - I think we're getting back to this whole situation where the issue you're going to
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:46.340]   constantly be getting into is that as soon as you hack it, because it's so connected,
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.140]   it can just be updated in a firmware and not work anymore.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.980]   - I talked to my local independent guy, and I brought him the phone to show him.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.580]   He's bummed because he doesn't want to like it because he can't sell it and won't probably
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.780]   won't be able to sell it for a while.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.140]   And he's too-- I'm bummed because I really want to hate this thing and I can't.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.580]   But he feels fairly confident.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:11.140]   He's in touch with a number of people that it will be unlocked sooner than later.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.140]   And he--
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.140]   - You can't update.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.820]   - You won't be able to update it, but at least-- and you won't have, obviously, if you
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:21.100]   use another carrier of things like visual voicemail, but you might get 90% of the functionality.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.900]   And I think-- I still don't-- I still really think-- there was a good article in
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.220]   Slate about this.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.220]   Was it Slater Salon?
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   Might have been Salon.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.660]   I really think it would have been-- Apple really should have sold an unlocked phone.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.100]   They shouldn't have done a deal with anybody.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.140]   I know we would lose some features, but it's a shame because it just means there's-- you
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.300]   know, it's a limited universe they can sell us to.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.460]   - Yeah, but they're getting-- Leo, they're getting paid from AT&T as far as I know.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.300]   No other cell phone manufacturers ever work to deal out like that.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:55.100]   So you can't-- I mean, if you can lock in revenue and you're a revenue generating company.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.220]   - It's your business to make money, I agree.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.540]   - In the longer term, did you see the article that was really talking about some of how
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.100]   far Google's coming as far as telecommunications and so on and so forth?
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.100]   - Interesting.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.100]   They're really moving.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.020]   They just bought Grand Central, which is a really neat company.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.660]   It's kind of a follow me service.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.060]   It's really the way people should be dealing with phones is through the online, you know,
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:22.260]   where you control your-- you know, what numbers, your voicemail, and it's a Grand Central's
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.260]   free.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.980]   And I guess now with Google acquiring them, they'll probably stay free for a while.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.700]   Although, now we have to worry about privacy, but that's another matter.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.460]   - Well, I mean, the interesting thing about that is that it really looks like Google is
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.620]   very close to having enough infrastructure to-- if they wanted to roll out their own service,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.220]   they could-- you know, they could do it.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220]   - Yep.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.700]   - Whether they will or not is up in the air, but they're really that far away.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.580]   And if you look at them-- I mean, maybe Apple needed to do what it needed to do for the
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.660]   first, you know, as I said, two years or-- I don't-- I personally don't-- I think that
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.420]   there's some way to get out of it after two years.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.980]   - That's what Scott was saying last time, is you can always get out of a contract.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   - Yeah.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:59.300]   So, I mean, the thing is that if Apple's not happy with AT&T, I mean, I didn't-- I personally,
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.700]   I guess people get really into it.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:05.780]   I mean, I admit that Verizon has better coverage, you know, but it didn't take me any-- I wasn't
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.700]   really even considering not just dropping them to get the iPhone.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.980]   - It's probably a commoditized business at this point where they're all equally good
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.980]   and bad.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.660]   It's probably not that much difference, really.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.140]   - They all suck at just a matter of which one sucks the least.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.140]   I think that's true.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.140]   - Right.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.340]   - So, in our places, though, where AT&T doesn't have a good signal, you know.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.340]   - Exactly.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.780]   And fortunately, my condo is not one of them.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.740]   I'm getting five bars, whereas before with Verizon, I was getting two.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.500]   - No, I'm getting good everywhere I've gone.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   - Yeah.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.300]   - How many does that phone guy get, Merlin?
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   - Merlin's fast asleep.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.300]   - I'm sorry.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.740]   - We talk-- we talk-- we talk to you, B.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.660]   - Let's talk about this weird thing that Merlin found, which is--
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.060]   - Serving up by corny as with a paring knife.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.060]   - What?
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.060]   - What?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.500]   It's the story there right now.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   You can't-- it's the message.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.660]   It's-- you know, there's the paradigm shift is underway.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:01.100]   And in this entire vertical, there's some very exciting movement happening in this space.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.100]   It's actually, you know, net net.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.100]   This is a very--
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.180]   - I'm booting my new online Mac.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.180]   Did you hear that?
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.180]   - Very.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.180]   - Did you hear that?
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.180]   This is cool.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.180]   Merlin uploaded this to us.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.180]   - I want to know what the heck this thing is.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.700]   It's an AS10 Mercury.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.220]   And so it's an Ajax-based OS10.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.100]   But I mean, obviously you can't install OS10 applications.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.860]   - But you can do stuff like-- I mean, it's just a-- I think it's just a prototype.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.460]   I don't know if it's hooked up to anything.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.220]   But you can click on the icons and you can go surf through the drive and you can open
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.220]   these apps.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.220]   I mean, I--
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.220]   - I'm going to put a lot of effort into this.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   - I posted it.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.940]   So one of you guys could explain to me what it is.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   I just thought it looked cool.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   - Oh, I'm getting a--
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.700]   - But it certainly is interesting as a proof of concept.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.700]   - I'm getting some 404s all of a sudden.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.700]   - Uh-oh.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.940]   - I think they've exceeded their bad-- it probably got dug.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   - Yeah.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.860]   - Yeah, it's not working anymore for a--
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.420]   - Well, what it was is a-- you know, for people who are super tuned into the Apple
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.740]   interface, the Mac OS10 interface, it's not a perfect duplicate.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   But it looks a lot like the Mac interface.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.500]   It's got a dock that magnifies when you roll over it.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.700]   It's got applications that open when you double click.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   - It's pretty good.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   - It's pretty good.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   - SE51, show it for Systemera51.net.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.700]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.700]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.340]   - They've got a few different interesting looking products.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.220]   I guess, yeah, I'm going to look at that more.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.940]   I saw it just before we did the show.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.740]   - Yeah, it's down now.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.860]   You know, I think it's actually-- I mean, the guy's resume is in the dock.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.700]   So I think it's-- but I can't read it because it's now all down.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:37.180]   But I think it's probably a project to, you know, show off your Ajax hacking skills, which
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.940]   are obviously very good.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.740]   But you know what, it must have gotten dug because it's--
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.980]   - And they have another-- if memory serves, they have another product that's meant to
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.700]   do something with the Apple TV or with that kind of front row-ish.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700]   What's that called?
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.700]   What's the interface?
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   - Front row, yeah.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.580]   - Yeah, but-- so anyway, I'm sorry we don't have the page to look at, but--
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   - It's cool.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.180]   - Yeah, I'll find out more and get back.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.020]   I have a press release that came out in association with this, so.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.060]   - So it's clear all cache and cookies before re-entering.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.420]   Maybe that's why I need to do that.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.020]   Anyway, it's kind of interesting.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:11.460]   Let's get to where-- I think we've got all the news out of the way, given that we don't
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.300]   want to do too much iPhone-- we could do the iPhone stuff forever, but if you want more
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.740]   iPhone, really, there's a place to go.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.540]   That's iPhone show.com, which has cracked the top 20 on iTunes.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.300]   - How about Apple Phone Show?
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.300]   - Apple Phone Show.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.300]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.300]   - I don't know about Apple Phone Show.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.300]   I was talking about the Apple--
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.300]   - It's Apple Phone Casting Tips.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.300]   - Thank you.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.740]   - I-- - The Apple Phone Show.com, and yes, thank you, Leo.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.100]   We're number 11 last time I checked in the overall.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.100]   - Isn't that great?
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   - Not hot.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.580]   - It's been a long time since I've had a podcast in the top 25.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.580]   That's great.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.580]   Congratulations.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.780]   Show's the interest in iPhone, and there are other iPhone shows.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.180]   It shows what a good Apple Phone Show it is.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   - Thank you.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.180]   - Apple Phone Show.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.180]   - Thank you.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.660]   - So let's get to our picks, I think.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.660]   - I got one.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.660]   I got one.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.540]   All right, Scotty, you start.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.500]   And I owe this to Shub, the Shuborama.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:05.060]   I don't know how to pronounce it, but it's S-H-I-I-R-A.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   It's a new browser.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.060]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.060]   - Shira.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.060]   - It's not that Shira.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.060]   - It's been around for a while, but it's very cool.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   - Well, new to me.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.060]   - Yeah.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:16.460]   - I cannot believe how lightweight it is, how nimble it is.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:20.980]   I'm a Camino lover, and I'm not abandoning Camino, but I got to tell you, I got Shira
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.580]   sitting there right there next to it in a dock.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.980]   - He's not using WebKit, I don't think.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.820]   I think this is all his own thing.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.140]   It's a Japanese guy.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:34.380]   It's S-H-I-I-R-A.JP, although there is an English version at en.php, but you just click
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.900]   the English flag there.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.700]   And small, lightweight.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.940]   Oh, I'm sorry, it is based on WebKit.
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:40.940]   It is WebKit.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.780]   Now that I can read the language, he says that right at the top there.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.100]   - Have you played with this?
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.460]   - Oh, yeah, that's great.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.460]   It's fast, isn't it?
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.780]   - Well, understand, because it's using WebKit, it's exactly as fast as Safari.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.580]   - Yeah, but Safari seems to have some overhead to it in case.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.180]   - Well, that may be true, you're right.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.620]   - This doesn't seem to have.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.380]   I found it to be, like I say, very lightweight, nimble and free.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.940]   And so I have a free pick.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.580]   This is a zero Alex pick.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.180]   - A word of warning, and I don't know if this is true, but I would guess it is, if you download
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:17.300]   the new Safari 3, it probably will break Shira, because Safari 3 makes some big changes to
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   WebKit.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   - Oh, good to know.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.060]   - So any program that relies on WebKit may or may not work after you update this part.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.460]   - I had Safari 3 installed for about 40 seconds.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.460]   - Yeah, it breaks a lot.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.460]   It broke one password.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.460]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.300]   It broke one password.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   It broke.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   Anyway, all my--
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.460]   - Well, it's really bad.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:41.980]   - Yeah, but I mean, man, it gave me a breathless nightmare vision of life without SAP, Safari
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.220]   stand and pith helmet, and I did not like the world that I saw.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.060]   - Well, you know, the rumor is that's where they're going with Leopard, no more input
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.060]   manager.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.820]   - I'm switching to Windows.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:57.980]   - I'll give you analogs for all those programs on Windows.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.300]   Every single thing you could do, you could do the same thing on Windows.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.340]   - I can write something like that in .NET.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.340]   - Easy.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.340]   - Easy.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.820]   - Actually, you know, I've been playing with Kevin Rose's new thing, Kevin, Leah, Culver,
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.020]   and Daniel, Berkor are doing a really-- I don't know if you sign in yet, it's called Pounce.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.020]   It's a Twitter, Jai P.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.020]   - I didn't give my invitation.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.020]   I looked for it.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.020]   - I'll send it to you again.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.420]   I think it's getting spammified.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:26.220]   But you should take a look at it, but the client in the for it is written in Apollo, which
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.500]   is this new Adobe technology, Windows NMac cross-platform.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.380]   And it's beautiful.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.140]   And I think Air, which is the Apollo installer that you need to run, has there.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.140]   We're going to see more of that.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:43.180]   And that may end up being an important part on Windows NMac of cross-platform development.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.220]   - Have you played that at all?
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.220]   Alex?
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.340]   - Yeah, I've actually looked at a lot of it.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.260]   The Flex stuff looks really, really cool.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.380]   The Apollo stuff looks very, very-- I mean, it's the way you want-- like, when you look
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.700]   at some of the Flex examples, if you go to the Adobe--
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.500]   - Flex the language that you write in when you're doing Apollo?
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.420]   - Flex is an application.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.500]   I think it's an API.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.220]   I've just looked at the examples.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:09.940]   And so I have to admit, Flex is kind of a developing-- I think it's like a-- it's a
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.660]   developing environment to do stuff that's still sitting on top of Flash.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:18.100]   But it's the ability to put all this stuff together, sort of to have kind of that age
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:22.220]   axis kind of feel when you're fairly easily to put together e-commerce sites.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.460]   And when you look at them, when you look at some of the examples they have on Adobe.com,
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:32.300]   you really see like, oh, that's really what I like to see more of.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.980]   The big issue, I think, is going to be how many-- if Apple supports Flash and how many
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.500]   iPhones they sell, those are the two things.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:45.100]   Because if they don't support Flash and they sell five to 10 million iPhones, it's going
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:49.060]   to be really complicated for Adobe.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.700]   So one of the things-- one of those two things don't have it if they start supporting Flash
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.580]   and if they-- or if they don't sell a lot of phones.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.380]   I mean, when I say a lot more than a million phones or whatever, which I think is--
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.380]   - That's next weekend.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.380]   So--
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.260]   - Oh, you know, they're going to have sold more zoons in five days, more-- I mean, more
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.220]   iPhones than zoon in five days.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   - Yeah.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:12.180]   And so the issue you get into is that that's-- I think this is going to be a really interesting
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:19.580]   drama because the-- if Apple really does just-- if this starts running away like the iPod
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:26.220]   and it doesn't support Flash, you know, it's really hard to see how Flash really continues
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.900]   to have the ubiquity that it's had up until now.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.940]   And so it'll be interesting because it's-- which I think would be unfortunate only because
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.940]   there's so much great-- there's so many great applications like Flex and Apollo and all
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.660]   these other things that are coming out.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.940]   But I think it would be very hard.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.220]   I know for me as a content developer, I'd be thinking, I have to watch what's going on
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.220]   before I really--
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.220]   - Why did they leave it out?
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.220]   I don't understand why they didn't put Flash in the iPhone.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.220]   - Well, they do make a competitor called QuickTime.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:51.220]   - So you think that--
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.220]   - Yeah.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:58.100]   - But yeah, but if you go to the web, nobody's using QuickTime to do-- you know, I mean,
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.500]   nobody's doing what they're doing with Flash, so--
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   - Well, there's a lot of stuff that you could do.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.460]   No one's doing it because there's not a lot of applications that are available to do
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.900]   that stuff, but there are-- QuickTime's capable of that, especially if you start mixing
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.220]   it with a lot of the Ajax-type stuff.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:19.820]   There's a lot of things that are-- it's possible to do in that realm that's not being done
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.020]   and might be done if it was supported more from Apple.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.580]   And I think that might be the thought process going on.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.780]   I think that there's also issues with the onto format, the codec itself that Flash is
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:35.340]   using and some of the ARM chips, which is what we have in the iPhone.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.220]   So there are some compatibility issues.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.340]   I don't think that they're only leaving it out because just out of spite, and I think
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.260]   that there's actually some decompression issues that are going on.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:50.180]   - Well, Scott, you actually have kind of led the charge here with your post on your--
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.980]   is it onlinemediatips.com?
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   - Right.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.740]   - Asking, well, what is the next video format?
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:00.940]   Where do we go to have compatibility on things like the iPhone?
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.940]   - Right now it's H.264.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.940]   I mean, that is the--
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.420]   - That's the iPhone standard.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.740]   - Well, it's also the Apple TV standard.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.980]   That's what YouTube is converting all of their video format.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.260]   - Is YouTube going to-- for everything?
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.820]   I know they're doing it for the iPhone.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.500]   Is that how YouTube is going to be?
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.940]   - They're not saying that that's-- they're not saying that the YouTube website's going
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.660]   to be all Flash, but all of the content's being converted to H.264 by the fall.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.660]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   - So you'll be able to--
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.500]   - So they're an act tied to Flash, I guess, is the point.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.900]   - Well, I mean, when you look at-- there's 30,000 now available via-- when you open up
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.380]   your Apple TV, everything playing on your Apple TV on YouTube is not Flash.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.620]   - That was H.264. That was converted by YouTube for-- to be used on Apple TV.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.980]   - I want to have a issue-- I want to lodge a complaint because dick in the box, the
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   sinking is bad.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.980]   - I'm sorry.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:51.060]   - No, I'm just meaning it's not-- it's not the lip sinking is there-- there out of sink.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.700]   I wonder if that's-- if the conversion-- it's automated, I'm sure I want to--
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.500]   - I haven't seen many of my favorites, Rattle.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.260]   I haven't seen many of my favorites show up yet, and I'm kind of bummed.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.260]   - Yeah.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.740]   Well, you should be on there, for instance.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:05.260]   - Well, I've got-- I mean, I've only got five really old favorites that have shown up,
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.780]   and I wonder if I need to force some kind of update or something.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.660]   - Well, it's-- I'm sure it's all automated.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.660]   - Yeah.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.700]   - Eventually they'll get everybody.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:19.820]   Before we get to-- so, Shira, S-H-I-R-A.JP, that is Scott Warren's pick, and I agree,
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.020]   I can cur a really slick, sweet, fast browser for the Macintosh.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:27.780]   But before we get to the rest of the picks, I want to remind everybody that this show,
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:30.100]   as is most of the podcast network here at Twit.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.940]   I'm sorry, Netcast Network, is being brought to you by audible.com.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.980]   The good folks at Audible have bought us.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.820]   Lock, stock, and barrel, and I couldn't be happier about it.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.740]   I didn't pay much, but I'm happy that they-- I think it's a great relationship, and I'm
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:49.620]   really pleased because I've been an Audible subscriber for years.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.620]   Plus, I think podcast listeners should know about Audible.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.260]   Every show we're trying to pick is something fun, something interesting, something new
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:00.060]   for you to listen to, and if you are not yet an Audible member, you can get it
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.500]   for free by joining up at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.900]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.780]   And this week, I think Merlin's got a book for us.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.780]   Yeah, I do.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.100]   I got a book that I like a lot.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.620]   I've got the Dead Tree version of it, but this is available on Audible.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.700]   Leo, you strike me-- actually, all of you guys strike me as the tidy type.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.700]   The good guy.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:24.380]   You guys strike me as the kind of people who--
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   Scott's tidy.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.180]   We don't live in squalor.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.180]   I live in squalor.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.180]   I live in squalor.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.580]   Well, I have the book for you.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:38.900]   I have actually been writing a series on 43 folders this week that you can visit at clutter.43folders.com
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:45.100]   and it's all been inspired by this wonderful book I'm reading called It's All Too Much
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.060]   and the author's name is Peter Walsh.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:52.980]   And you may know Peter Walsh from a cable TV show called Clean Sweep where he and his
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:59.140]   team of telegenic house fixer-uppers parachute into messy houses and help people get it together.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.980]   He is the organizational guy and he has fantastic advice on how to deal with the clutter in
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:10.100]   your life and how to basically give yourself permission to cut away all of the stuff that
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.660]   doesn't really have a place and the life that you would like to have.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.420]   And unlike other kinds of clutter or tip books, I found this one very effective because it's
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.100]   very-- it's very based around the idea of dealing with the emotions that keep you tied
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.940]   to all this junk that you keep around for no reason and confront that straight on and
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.540]   then just start filling garbage cans.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.340]   Oh man, I could use some help with that.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.820]   Yeah, he's got a lot of really good practical tips for how to deal with this stuff.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.860]   I mean a lot of it's kind of conventional wisdom along the lines of, you know, have
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.180]   you used this in the last six months or what have you?
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:44.900]   But he has a whole plan where you can go through room by room and kind of, you know,
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.620]   kind of get an idea for what your vision for what that room is versus what you're actually
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620]   using it for.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.020]   You know, do you really want your living room to be a glorified magazine stand?
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.580]   Or do you want it to be a place where you have a certain kind of a life?
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.420]   And I think that's a really compelling approach.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.700]   And I like a lot.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.100]   It's all too much by Peter Walsh available and on Audible.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.340]   Audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Macbreak.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.420]   You do have to join up, but if you decide you don't, for some reason, want to keep doing
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.700]   it, you can quit and there's no obligation, no charge.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.700]   You have something?
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.700]   But I think you're going to like it.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.500]   You know, I'm getting conflicting reports.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.740]   It may depend on the book.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:27.700]   It may depend on something else, but some people are able to sign up overseas.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.260]   I had an email from a guy in Switzerland who signed up.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.260]   So just try it.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.220]   But yes, far as I know, for most of you, it's US only.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:40.140]   And some of this is that many of these books aren't available overseas and that's due to
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:45.620]   publishers restrictions and something that's neither in our control or Audible's control.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.820]   And sometimes not even in the author's control, unfortunately.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:53.620]   Audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Macbreak.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.180]   In our book of the week, it's all too much by Peter Walsh.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.900]   We thank Audible for supporting the TwitNetcast network.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.740]   Now let's get to, I tell you what, let's do Alex Lindsey's pick of the week.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.300]   I don't have a pick.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.300]   Okay.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   Let's move on.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.140]   Are you so involved in your iPhone that you don't have time to have a pick for the
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   kids?
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   Is that how it works?
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.140]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.020]   I literally, I have been so busy.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   I have been.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020]   It's okay.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.020]   You don't have to have a pick.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.580]   And I spent like an hour before the show trying to think of something that I wanted to
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.100]   do a pick for and I just couldn't.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.660]   I know how it worked.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.060]   The minute the show's over, you'll go, "Oh, I got one."
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.060]   And it'll be too late.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.020]   Well, if you get a last minute pick, just email it to me and we'll get to Alex to put
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.020]   it in the show.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.020]   Alex Greshehr.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:42.140]   Merlin, actually I'll do mine and then we'll let you wrap it up.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   I have a pick.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.140]   See?
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.380]   It just had to come to me.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   What's your pick?
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.540]   I think it's actually, it's a little bit of hardware.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:54.500]   And I don't know if you guys, what do you use as a USB reader?
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.460]   I use a Dell monitor.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.380]   They have all the slots, aren't they?
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.860]   But like your laptop, when you're traveling.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.780]   I carry a couple of different ones with me.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.500]   Some of them are off brand ones.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.780]   One I got on at one of those stores in New York City in Times Square.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   And it cost me like $400.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.780]   You can say $400.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780]   Yeah, you need anything.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.780]   Tony guts.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   Tony guts.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.380]   Tony, because it's got Chrome all over it.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.180]   There you go.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.620]   You know, I, right before my trip, I just needed kind of a multi, because I have this,
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.820]   I have one of those Zoom H4s and I've got a camera that has a different kind of memory.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.100]   You know, I had all these different memory sticks.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.780]   And so I had to find something that would fit into it.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.940]   And Sony makes a little one.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.940]   It's about 30 bucks.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.820]   You know, it's $20 or $30.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:42.140]   And it's USB 2 and it fits just about all the different car, you know, the compact flash.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.060]   And I got to find the actual serial number.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.780]   I think they only make one of them that's like that.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.220]   But, you know, it does the smart cards and stuff like that that Sony has.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.300]   A lot of card readers, not a lot, but there are some brands that don't work well with
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   a Mac.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.300]   So it's actually good to know what ones work.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.020]   No, this one, this one works out really, really well.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.020]   Hold on one second.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.020]   Let me grab it.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.020]   He's going to rush over and he's bending over now.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.180]   Don't goose him.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.940]   And now he's going to return.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.740]   And I'm saying this so I don't have to edit this thing.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.420]   And now we're waiting.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.020]   I think one of the things is that I just had a lot of these and I really hated them.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.020]   You know, I've really hated them.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.020]   Yeah, a lot of them.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.020]   I can't remember what company it is.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020]   Is it Sandisk?
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.540]   One of them just, you know, half of them don't work with the Mac.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:29.180]   And so this one, this one is the Sony and I guess the model, it's just called a multi-card
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.180]   reader writer.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.540]   And it's the model MRW62E.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:39.460]   But it does smart media, MMC, SD, compact flash, micro drive and memory stick.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.780]   And I've even put like two of them at the same time and they just pop up.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.020]   It's like a little drive interface.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.940]   And it's, you know, as I said, it's USB 2 and it's been really, you know, I only say that
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:55.100]   I like it just because it's just that I've had, I've gone through like five of these things.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.100]   And it's just the right size.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.460]   It's like a little lighter, a little bit bigger than a lighter, I guess.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.540]   But a little square that just pops in with everything else.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.700]   And it works really well.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.460]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.460]   Mine is, thank you.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.940]   So that is the Sony USB reader.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.220]   Mine is something that is actually good for anybody, Mac, Windows.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.300]   I don't know if it works on Linux.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:22.260]   But it's something that had a bad reputation for a long time, probably deservedly so.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.540]   And is now I think starting to become really cool, really useful.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.900]   Don't yell at me, Merlin Man.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.900]   It's called Plaxo.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.060]   Oh, interesting.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.700]   The new Plaxo 3 is out.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.780]   And I think, you know, many of us looked at Plaxo, used Plaxo for a while.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.900]   And you know, the problem with Plaxo is when you first sign up for it, it makes it too
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.700]   easy to spam all your friends saying, "Hey, I just got Plaxo and I'd like to keep you
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.060]   in my contact book.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.060]   Please send me your information."
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.140]   By the way, if you'd like to sign up for Plaxo, and it's spammy.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.940]   They know that they don't, I've talked with the principals over there.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.580]   And you know, because I've criticized them for that.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.660]   And they said, "We know, you know, the problem is it's no, this stuff doesn't work unless
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.900]   there's critical mass.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.580]   You've got to, it's the network effect.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.860]   Unless you're, all your contacts are using it.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   It's not good."
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.980]   Here's, let me tell you what Plaxo does.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.700]   And what the new Plaxo 3 does that makes it really of interest to Mac users.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:21.580]   The idea of Plaxo originally was keep your contact list up to date.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.100]   Your friends sign up for Plaxo, you sign up for Plaxo.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.180]   There are free and paid accounts.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.180]   I actually have a paid account and I have for some time.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:32.100]   And when your friend updates their contact information, it's automatically piped into
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.820]   your address book.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.020]   There's a little Plaxo sync tool for Mac.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.020]   Works pretty well.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.460]   I've had some issues in the past.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.820]   They've addressed those and I'll explain that in a second.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.540]   Well now they've added calendar syncing.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.780]   They've added notes.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.220]   They've added feeds.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:53.620]   And frankly, it's an online PIM that's very impressive because once you get it synced up
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:59.140]   with your Mac, your iCal and your address book now can be synced with almost everything
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:05.060]   else, including the Yahoo calendar, Google calendar, Yahoo address book, all automatically
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.380]   linked in.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.740]   And so suddenly it has a D-duper that will automatically remove duplicates.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:15.740]   And that was a problem in the past I've had is that it's, sometimes it's added duplicates.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.260]   And so that fixes that.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.540]   But also I've had problems in the past with it accidentally erasing all of mine.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.460]   They now have an automatic backup so you never lose your contacts again.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.020]   It's kind of like a system restore.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.940]   It sets restore points.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.620]   You can back up to your all your different Macs.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.980]   It has supports Outlook and MSN as well.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.860]   So it's great for people who use cross-platform solutions.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.260]   I have to say I'm really impressed.
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.940]   The online tasks calendar and address book are very usable, very Ajax.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:51.940]   Everybody is good as say Google calendar or Yahoo calendar.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.980]   If you've kind of looked at Plaxo in the past and rejected it, I think Merlin especially
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.820]   you, this might be time to re-examinate it.
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:04.780]   This is the new Plaxo 3 which is in beta and I think very, very interesting.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.780]   Have you ever tried?
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.260]   No, I have not.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.260]   I have not.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.300]   For you I will look but I have a thesis.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.740]   My thesis is that there's two kinds of people in the world.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.940]   There are the kinds of people in the world like Leo Leport who want to be able to manage
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.500]   these relationships with people.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.060]   And there's people like Alex and me that don't want anyone to know where they live.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.180]   I don't want anyone to know their phone number and I do everything to have people not know
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.340]   my email address and then I change it if people in that.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.180]   And so I think part of it is that it would be kind of disagreeing with-
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.540]   It's great for sales people who want to keep track of clients obviously.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.540]   Yeah, well they should kill themselves with sales people.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.860]   But I say that he's got to do it.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.660]   I say that with love.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.420]   No, you know that I can see that being useful.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:47.980]   My problem is what you identify which is that I have gotten, it just seems like from some
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:52.260]   people in particular I finally either certain domain names that I just bounced now.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.260]   Yep.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.260]   And right now that's one.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.260]   Because now that's one.
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:58.100]   Yeah, hey I just changed from Street Avenue, my mistake.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.140]   Well, you can now by the way opt out.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.740]   They have an opt out button that you can opt out of receiving emails from Plaxo.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   They'll do it for you.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.780]   They understand that this was a real problem for them.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.020]   I will have another look.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.020]   I'm on the Facebook, you know, and that to me was a big step.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.140]   Getting on the Facebook was a big step.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.660]   But I agree if you don't need to keep track of people.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.420]   If you don't want to know where people are or what their latest address is or so forth.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.980]   What you're describing is not only sharp though.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.580]   It's also, to back to our very much earlier point, it's also neat that the more people
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.980]   make stuff work together and sink and stuff like that, the more it can theoretically put
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.620]   the pressure on Apple to make some improvements to .Mac.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.260]   I know that's a long, that's a far-fetched point.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.860]   But anybody out there who's doing stuff to make things sink with G-Cal and stuff like
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.060]   that, I'm all for it.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.660]   And the free version does that.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   And that's what to me, that's the addition that I think is so significant.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.780]   In fact, you can forget keeping track of your context.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.300]   You can don't even use that part of it.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.340]   But the fact that now my, suddenly my, I've got this sinking capability not just with
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:04.140]   other Macs, but with everything, including Google and Yahoo is great.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:08.220]   I mean, by the way, for your iPhone users, I mean, I've been using Yahoo mail now all
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.020]   of a sudden, that's important to me.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.180]   So this kind of, you know, you're now back to this Yahoo environment.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.940]   It's kind of, you know, I think there are reasons that you might want to do this.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:24.060]   Now, Plaxopremium, you could try free for 30 days, but there is a basic version that's
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.340]   free and that gives you all the sink capabilities.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.180]   So I think that that's worth taking a look at.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.100]   You know, I've had mixed feelings about Plaxop.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.980]   So I know people hate it.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:38.820]   I think that they've taken that to heart and they're really trying to do something about
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.660]   it and it's pretty good.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.900]   They've got 15 million users now, which means they've got the network effect.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.060]   Maybe they don't need to be so aggressive, right?
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.220]   I just don't, I hate the idea of someone having all my contact information and everyone.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.380]   Well, you don't have to do that.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.540]   I mean, you don't have to share it at all.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.540]   I don't want them to have it.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.540]   I don't want them to have it.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:03.540]   I don't want them to be connecting, see every connection that I have.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.660]   That freaks you out.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.660]   It totally freaks me out.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:07.660]   I'm too dark.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.580]   It's like, if you're, if you're, I mean, obviously you should read their privacy and
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:16.100]   statement and they claim to be absolutely secure and private and they have a, you know, obviously
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.260]   a standard, but see, I use, I use Google.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.580]   I sink with, and I, I've always looked for a way to get my Google calendar to sink with
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.500]   the ICal without a lot of trouble.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   And this does it.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.700]   And the Google and the Yahoo calendar and Yahoo address book and this does it.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.660]   There's a populate back into your ICal from.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:32.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.660]   So you don't need Spanning Saint or something like that.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.660]   No, this replaces that.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.660]   It works.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:36.660]   Sexy.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.660]   Works very well.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.220]   In fact, if Google adds an address book, then, then I'll really be happy.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.100]   So anyway, it's just worth taking a look at.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.300]   I understand everybody's privacy concerns and spam concerns.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.380]   And I think some of people don't need this.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.700]   But I've been, I actually been very surprised.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:53.700]   All right.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.700]   Now it's Merlin's turn.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.380]   Uh, the conversation that we've been having for a long time has been around the whole idea
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:04.540]   of backup and we keep threatening to have a show dedicated to the idea of backup.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.180]   But I've had good luck, you know, getting better about backing stuff up locally.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.980]   I've automated a lot of that with Superduper.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.540]   I've got a raid that takes care of a lot of that stuff.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.780]   The missing piece for me is making sure the day to day stuff is still getting taken care
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.780]   of.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   Some of that is taken care of with .max-sync, the most overpriced service in the entire
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780]   Apple.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.780]   I take a bite.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   Ooh.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   Ooh.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   Pinch me.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.540]   Uh, but I like that it works between my multiple max.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.180]   I am, I just started using a new service that I think is really cool.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.820]   Are you going to say Mozy?
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.820]   I am.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.820]   Have we already done it?
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.820]   No.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.820]   I discovered, I just discovered Mozy too.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:41.820]   Amazing.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.820]   Is that okay if I knew, is that all right?
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:43.820]   Is that all right to do that one?
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.100]   No, I'm thrilled that you're doing it.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.060]   I think this is an amazing service.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.060]   Mozy is really interesting looking.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.060]   We've seen services before.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.420]   I've talked before about services that are based on S3, things like Jungle Disc that
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.980]   enable you to use them.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.980]   Too hard to use though.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.980]   Sorry?
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.980]   Too hard to use.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.260]   Well, there's a little bit of a ramp up for sure and there's a little bit of you got
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.260]   to enter API keys and that kind of stuff.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.500]   Nothing that's like a deal breaker but stuff like that can be a little bit of a pain to
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   set up.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.300]   What, what this, what, if I had to distill Mozy down to one sentence, it's an online
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.780]   backup service where you pointed at stuff and it automatically backs it up for you.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:22.940]   Now, what I was going to say was it's, it's a lot like the more complex online services
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:29.460]   involving S3 combined with the otherwise AC backup dot app, which I, which what I like
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.900]   about backup dot app is that it lets you identify groups of stuff like this folder or
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.580]   these applications and it's very easy to use, very easy interface.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.980]   Mozy has a very simple little configuration panel.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.900]   It'll scan through stuff and when it's done, it says, okay, here's what we found.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.420]   I found these iPhoto libraries.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.740]   I found these iTunes libraries.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.540]   I found these mail messages.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:53.500]   Do you want me to back those up and also would you like me to add any ad hoc file and folder
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.500]   things that you're choosing, which I've done and it does it.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500]   It just runs.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.780]   It has a free free version that gives you up to two gigs and an unlimited version for,
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.020]   I think it's 4.95.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]   That's what I bought.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.020]   A month, not.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.380]   And it takes a long time to upload.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:11.060]   I found it to be about 700k uploading, which is really slow.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.740]   But if you just let it run for a couple days, it'll do all your stuff.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.060]   There's a reason for that.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.780]   You kind of don't want it to hog your bandwidth.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.820]   One thing it's saying, yeah, I think it's throttled.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.780]   But this Mac version of it is in beta.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   It's new.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:27.380]   For those of you who have tuned this matters, it has 448-bit blowfish encryption, which
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.380]   sounds pretty good.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.740]   128-bit SSL, typical, I guess.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740]   You know, SSL.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.820]   Alex, you don't want to put anything personal online.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.140]   And although I have not a cation to do any restoring, it apparently does some kind of
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   versioning.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   I don't know how it's doing that.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   I don't know how many copies it keeps.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   I haven't spent more than a few days with it.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.300]   Anyway, if you're looking for something that's kind of a light, easy to use, not light and
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.340]   functionality, but light in terms of ease of use, not terribly expensive.
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.340]   This is a great idea.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.340]   So it's 4.95 a month.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.340]   What would that be?
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   Let me do a quick.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   60 bucks a year.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.340]   I don't know.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.340]   Actually it's 95.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.740]   That would be a 140 first of an Alex.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.780]   So yeah, I guess you're pronouncing it right.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:08.780]   I don't know.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780]   Mosey, Mosey.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   Mosey.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.780]   And I concur.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:17.260]   This is brilliant because if it's not off, if you don't have a backup that's out of
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.940]   your apartment or house or office, you don't really have a backup.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.940]   That's why my rate.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.940]   I feel like my rate is the first step.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.020]   I mean, I mean, if there's a fire, it all goes.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.100]   No, no, no, that's what I was going to say.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:29.740]   I feel like a rate is only valuable if you swap it every month with another rate that's
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.740]   at somebody's house.
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.740]   Right.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.740]   No, this is the best way to do it.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.500]   Backup is a fractal problem.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.060]   You know, the more you back up, the more you need backups, the rear backups and it's just
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.060]   not going away.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:43.180]   So this will help take some of the pain off and it'll all the little stuff that's really
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.180]   super important.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:49.860]   Maybe your application, like I'm not saying your library, you know, application support
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:54.820]   references, any of that stuff, I can back that up for you as it changes.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.060]   Berkeley data systems doesn't.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.940]   I think it's I actually have been very impressed by this.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.420]   I have a sponsor on the radio show that's a competitor of theirs, Carbonite, but they
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.140]   don't have a Mac solution.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.180]   But this is a great idea because it does it just kind of all the time in the background
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.740]   and you don't have to think about it anymore.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.740]   Good idea.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.740]   You actually had to turn it off.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.740]   I realized I was getting that kind of.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.540]   You should turn it off when you're doing this.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.860]   And I do that also.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.660]   I disable a Carbonite while I'm doing Skype.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.660]   Very good choice.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.660]   All good choices.
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:31.420]   We must now decamp because Mr. Borne has to go and well, we've pretty much run out
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.620]   of things to say that don't have anything to do with the iPhone.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.340]   So I think it's time to say good night, everybody.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:41.380]   I want to thank again, once again, Audible for their support and remind you that audible.com/macbreak
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.780]   is the place to go for your free audio book.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.020]   And I want to tell everybody to come back next week.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.780]   We'll talk more and I'm sure there'll be even more stories that don't have to do with
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.180]   an iPhone.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.940]   Thank you, Scott Borne, applephoneshow.com.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.660]   If you want to listen to a podcast that's all about the iPhone, Merlin Man's show has
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.020]   nothing to do with the iPhone.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.540]   It's at merlin, the merlin show.com.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.300]   It's the merlin show.com, right?
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   That's right.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:08.340]   And I'll since he's at the pixel course, got very quiet in here.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   I think you should.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:11.700]   Because I know what because Alex is playing with his damn phone.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.540]   I think everybody's playing with their iPhones.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.980]   Stop in the way with your iPhones.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:16.980]   We'll see y'all later.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.300]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
