[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   It's time for Mac, break weekly. Alex Lindsey is here from office hours. Global from WGBH in Boston, Andy and Aco Renee Richie has the week off more briefings from Apple. I'm guessing.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:21.000]   But look who's in his place. The great Mark Gurman from Bloomberg and the power on newsletter. Mark will tell us a little bit behind the scenes stuff from Apple's event last week.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Some of the things he missed, some of the things he knew about, didn't miss. Also which Apple products he's looking forward to, which ones he's going to buy. A little insight into what's ahead for Apple from somebody who knows better than almost anybody else. Coming up next on Mac, break weekly.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   This is Detroit.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It's time for Mac, break weekly episode 809 recorded Tuesday, March 15th, 2022 as tall as a middle finger.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's time for Mac, break weekly. The show we cover the latest Apple news. Wow, we had a big week last week. In fact, it was so big. It's taking Apple two weeks to brief Renee Richie. So Renee's not here. Andy Inaco is here.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's great to have you from WGBH of Boston from 090 Media. We've got Alex Lindsey and I want to save our special guest for last because it's a real thrill to have Mark Gurman in the house from Bloomberg's Power On.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's really your power on newsletter. It's good to see you. My power on newsletter. It's actually nice to be here. I think the last time I was a Mac, break weekly, may have been five, six years ago. So lots changed since then.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's our fault because I think we just decided you're too big time for us. And so that's...
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I looked at it. I jumped on this morning. I was like, Mark Gurman. Like we're at the market. We always talk about the microphone.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   No, no, no, no. Micah has me on all the time on the other shows. It's always fun.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   What for us? You have a great group, Leo.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Well, hey, we're really glad to have you. And you do a great job, of course. Your ears should be burning on every Tuesday because we're always quoting you and the power on.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And if Renee were here, he has sussed your method because he knows when you say sources say that that's a rumor, but when you say, I expect that's you.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So we've been able to parse your prose very carefully from now on.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It depends. It changes based on how I'm feeling. Oh, really? Sometimes...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So I expect it could be something you know. I expect it to be something I know. I mean, I won't say something unless I think it's true.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Sometimes I'll just straight up say I expect this and that, but that means I know it to be true.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   In other cases, I'll make it very clear. Like when I say this is my opinion, right? Like I wrote a story a few weeks ago saying that Apple should launch a $200 iPhone SE by lowering the price of the old one.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm me saying Apple should do something doesn't mean that I necessarily think they're going to do it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I just thought they should do it. And I still think they should do it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So clearly we're going to have to modify our parser so that we get you exactly right.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I like to keep you and Renee on your toes, right?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So actually one of the things I was thinking after the event last Tuesday was how many things the rumor mill got wrong, actually?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So what do you think the rumor mill got wrong?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Well, we didn't see that plexiglass covered Mac Mini.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'm guessing that what happened was Apple saw the thermals of the ultra and they said, "Hmm, you know what?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Was that rumor a plexiglass Mac Mini?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Wasn't it with the plexiglass top? Maybe not by you, but certainly I hadn't seen that.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Certainly there were renders of a Mac Mini with a thinner here.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Let me see. This is from May. Well, that's May of last year.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Plexiglass colorful squared toy. There were lots of renders.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You can't trust renders, obviously.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So there's three Mac minis or there were three Mac minis in development, right?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   One of them was the Mac Studio. The Mac Studio is depending on who you ask.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It is either a beefed up Mac Mini or shrunken down Mac Pro.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   The way it was explained to me is that there's three Mac minis.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   One is the Mac Studio. That's the high end.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   The high end and then the mid tier is sort of the M1 Pro M2 Pro.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The M2 Pro Mac Mini is going to come out.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The M2 Mac Mini is the bottom tier.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The M2 Mac Mini would replace the M1 Mac Mini that launched a year and a half ago.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   The M2 Pro Mac Mini would replace the Intel Space Grey Mac Mini that still exists.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And then the Mac Studio, obviously, at the very high end.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So those are your three Mac minis.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Well, this is good. We only have two so far, but we will get the third, you think.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Do you think June or do you think the fall?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So there will be new Macs both in the middle of the year, so between May, June,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and there also will be new Macs in the fall.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So my belief is the Mac Pro will come out either in the fall or be announced by the fall and released at the end of this year or sometime next year.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I know the Mac Pro, they're sort of so they were originally going to do an M1 Ultra M1 extreme version of the Mac Pro.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   But I think people don't realize is that the M1 chip is actually based on the A14 architecture, which is from already two years ago from 2020.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Right. And they're not going to want to release another Mac based on the A14 architecture.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   They're going to move everything to an A15 base.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now, for all intents and purposes, the M1 and the M2 are not very different technology wise, but to different code base.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's a different core. And so they have to shift to that.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So I would expect new Macs between May and June and then more new Macs in the fall.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   There's been a lot of talk about this iMac Pro. I think a lot of people are tuning in because they want to know what in the world is happening with the iMac Pro.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And I saw a nine if iMac right a few days ago, they're hearing there's no bigger iMac, there's no iMac Pro in the works, but I'm pretty certain there's going to be an iMac Pro.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Interesting.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So it's probably the next year, yeah, and it'll be like M2 Pro and two Macs. It'll be the Mac desktop version of the Mac book Pro, which I'm on right now. And I think it's awesome.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   We operate out of ioperate. I shouldn't speak for the others out of ignorance based on just what I reached from you and then what I could put together.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But so a couple of things. One is I felt like the this made a lot of sense.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I was waiting to buy a mini because I didn't want to buy another iMac because it seems silly to couple two devices with different update cadences, a display and a computer into one thing.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And so I was just going to buy a mini, a high-end mini.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And it looked like Apple kind of had the same idea and said, you know, we should deconstruct the iMac.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You could still get an iMac, but you get it in two pieces. But you think that's not the case that they still are going to do a 27-inch iMac Pro.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So that's Apple's party line until the iMac Pro comes out, right? They can't just have people waiting. So they're going to say get a little bit of interest.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   This is all there is.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Right. But if you break it down, if you really break it down, the Mac Studio plus the Studio display, if you get it with the M1, sorry, the M1 Macs, that's 2000 almost.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Plus the display is 1600. So that's a $3600 machine. Right. You get it with the M1 Ultra. That is a, what is the M1 for?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   4000. That's a almost $6000 machine. Right. There is room in the lineup to have a iMac Pro.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Well, no, maybe, maybe, maybe, but I'm referring to something closer to 3000, right? Or in the high 2000s.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Something in that MacBook Pro tier, right? The MacBook Pro, I believe, is between mid 2000s and 3000s, depending on how you spec it out.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I think it goes from $22.99 to $34.99 or $32.99 or whatever. Anyways, what I'm trying to say, it's in a $1000 range from the mid to the mid to the mid 3s. Right?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's the sweet spot for an iMac Pro. Whereas the Mac Studio with the display, that comes in above. Right?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Right. So it's a higher end device than an iMac Pro would be?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   No, this is what an iMac Pro would be. It would be the desktop version of the MacBook Pro.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   So the MacBook Pro has the M1 Pro and the M1 Macs. Eventually, the M2 Pro and the M2 Macs, there will be an iMac equivalent.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Kind of in a similar to the 24-inch iMac is sort of like an iPad on a stick.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Exactly. Or the desktop equivalent to the MacBook Air or the 13-inch Pro.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And by the way, there will be a revamped MacBook Air. This is going to be the biggest update to the MacBook Air and the product's history.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   That's coming this year. Right? That's going to be a full redesign.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   That's M2. That's M2. There's also going to be an M2 MacBook Pro this year. That's a 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro they have today will be updated to an M2. To be clear though, the M1 Pro and M1 Macs MacBook Pro is the 14-inch and 16-inch.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Those still will blow the M2 MacBook Air, Mac Mini, MacBook Pro out of the water.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   People have likened it to Intel's TikTok cadence where you have a new platform which is the M2 and then you enhance it which is the M2 Ultra.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So you have the M1, the M1 Pro, Macs and Ultra. Then you can do the M2 which is going to be much closer to an M1.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   M2 is essentially an M1. It's an A15 based M1. The CPU speed increases will be quite marginal.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   We're not talking about it. The other thing I find interesting is that this Ultra still is the same clock speed as the base M1.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   They haven't changed clock speeds. So the way these chips work is that they're completely dynamic.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   All these chips are all based on that core M1 and they're just doubling and doubling and doubling.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Like the Mac Pro will be essentially... You think it'll be a quad core? It'll be quad die?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It'll be a quad die. The Mac Pro will be a quad die.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So when John Seruji said there's one thing you don't know, is this interconnected? Did you know that?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yes. I know it!
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Yes, of course. But the question is, we know there's the interconnect at the bottoms of the M1 Maxes.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The question I have is if there's interconnects on the sides as well.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   If it's going to be a perfect square or if it's going to be a long...
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Right. A big quad tower or a place sign.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   So the thing that always gets me, but I think it's a little funny to me, is I have zero concept of how physically big these chips are.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Yeah, they look big. It's probably the size of your pinky nail, really.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Who knows? I guess that's something I should be right.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I guess you can figure it out. I mean, honestly, I think they're probably the size of...
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I mean, I would guess that the M1 Maxes stacked the M1 Altra's probably the size of an iPhone.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Wow. That big.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Like at the Mac Pro chip. Probably. Yeah, because I think an A14 or an A15 on its own is probably about the size.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I think it's a little bit smaller than the camera bump itself.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Yeah. Just based on the teardowns.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Man, this is so great. We're getting all this straight story here.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So the other thing I think we thought... You obviously didn't, but the rumor mill, which I'm going to keep you out of,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   thought there'd be a 7K display, which I thought was a strange B-C.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That's coming. That's coming.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That's coming.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Because part of the problem is that no one knows what Apple's going to release at any given time,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   but they know what might be in the pipeline.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Right. So the cheaper display, this is actually a pretty quick program, right?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So they started working on that in, I believe, mid-2020. Wow.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And they finished it, like probably around mid to end of 2021.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   That would kind of explain the A13 in it, actually.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   That's exactly why. That's exactly it. That's exactly it.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So they have that A13. That was that generation.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   That was that generation, right? And they probably figured they didn't need more.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So this display was ready to go for a while.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And the concept behind it was to do a display at a third of the price of the Pro XDR.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And it was developed to go alongside these M1 machines.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   So the MacBook Pro, the Mac Minis and whatnot.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And then they're going to have that 7K to go alongside the Mac Pro.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   So what Apple's doing is they're basically taunting Intel at this point, right?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Like Intel held Apple back so significantly.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And what they've been able to do in just two, three years now is they've been able to rapidly expand the product line.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And they're basically doing everything, right? They now...
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   So now we know how big the M1 Ultra is. It's as big as the middle finger.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's exactly right. The biggest the middle finger, right?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And so, and then the Mac Pro version is two middle fingers.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So what you're able to do now is what they're able to do is they're able to put out different Macs,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   different designs, different styles at different price points.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And moving the Mac to Apple Silicon, I think, is one of Apple's greatest accomplishments.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It'll go down in history, honestly.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Bigger than moving to Intel from PowerPC. Huge.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And the fact that it shares DNA with the iPhone, the iPad,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   the new screen, the Apple TV, like, you know, there's a shared architecture all the way through that entire process.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And for, you know, long-term development, that's a huge deal from an efficiency perspective.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Why put the A13 in a monitor? Is that for center stage and surround sound or do they have higher hopes?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I sure hope they have higher hopes. I have high hopes for their high hopes because they...
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   There's a lot you can do with it with basically an Apple TV inside of a screen.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   It's faster than the Apple TV 4K. I mean, it's the iPhone 11.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   So you could play games on it without it connected anything.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You could watch movies in a picture and picture and it wouldn't affect your computer at all.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   You could have calls, you know, without the computer on or without the computer needing it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But there's also a lot of, you know, tight integration that can happen between all the devices as well as far as airplay...
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   You could airplay to it without it needing any other device, right?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   In order to do that, though, maybe Mark knows something about this.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You'd have to put in storage and memory. You can't just put a chip in it.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You'd have to... You can't make it an Apple TV without storage, right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And even now they say to use Siri with it, you have to have a computer attached to it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Yeah, I mean, I'd be very, very surprised if they...
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I don't think Apple's the company at this point that's going to come out of left field and say you can do all these tricks with the monitor as standalone.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I'm not... I'm completely brutally honest.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I'm not optimistic about Apple's ability to pull, you know, kind of...
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So why don't you just put a T2 in there or something? Why put in all that processor power?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Maybe they just had a bunch of them lying around?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I think so. And that takes me to another point.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Like I think one of the reasons they put the M1 and the iPad Air is because they need to save the A15s for other devices.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We are in a chip crunch.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And, you know, they probably have backlogs of certain chips developed.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   They know what chips they have extras of. Yeah.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Exactly. And the iPhone 11 is, you know, they're sort of slowing down the units that they're selling of that device, right?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   They still sell the iPhone 11, I believe, on their website, even though they sell the SE.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But I think they have plenty of those A13 chips.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Also helps with cost efficiency as well.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   They've been producing the A13 for years now, so obviously, economy is a scale.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   As you continue to produce, the cost come down.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So that's why I think they did it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   If that's somebody calling from Cupertino, go ahead and take that call because if you've got a hot tip, I don't want to slow you down.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Oh, that's not my phone. Oh, okay.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Somebody else's. Alex, is your heart broken?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I too. I thought an A13 would be something really interesting.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Well, I think we just have to see what happens.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I mean, we saw the ultra wide band chips in there for a long time without anybody turning them on.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   They just go, "I'll put this in."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   One of the things you look at when you start putting together a monitor is a monitor is going to stay around for a long time.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So whatever you want to do with that monitor needs to be in it when it ships and available for the next three to five years.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   So that's not, it's a longer term device, and so they have to think through that as well.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I agree. I feel like, oh, sorry, go ahead, Andy.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I was just going to say, I think that it's simpler reasons than that. There are some cool features that are kind of require an iPhone to make work.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's very, very easy to make it work if you just basically take a CPU from there and run the same sort of stack on there.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I mean, it does have center stage. I think that's the sort of reason why they're putting that kind of chip in there.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   We're not going to know for sure until I fix it, tears the thing.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Not just the case down, but really tears that board down to see, as Leo suggested,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   is there more support hardware attached to this CPU than is simply required just to activate, activate really good web, really good visual processing,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   really good image processing, really good audio processing and center stage.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's what we'll know if there's future enabled.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Otherwise, I really think this is all about giving you the best webcam experience, the best chat, the best conference experience that you can possibly get.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And again, if you've got them in the warehouse, use them.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   True. I completely agree with Andy. I think that's the simplest explanation.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   To me, aside from Alex's very good point about the ultra wide band chips,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I think Apple's the type of company that puts out hardware they move on.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I think what you see is what you get with the A3R.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Yeah, they don't do the Google Pixel drop thing where, hey, guess what?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   We're going to turn on three new features. They've never done that.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Not quite a minute.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   They've done it for the HomePod Mini and the HomePods.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Haven't they turned on additional features with those?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So the HomePod Mini, this is an interesting one, actually has a humidity sensor.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Exactly. Right.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   But they never have it turned it on yet.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   And it's had that sensor in it for two years.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   So maybe they'll turn it on in a year or so.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   But, you know, sometimes...
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And I think sometimes they put the hardware in thinking that it was going to be ready on time,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   but they're not going to put anything out just yet because it's not quite ready.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And things get rolled out a little bit later. We've definitely seen that in the past.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I hope I'm wrong. I would just be shocked if they added any additional bells and whistles.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Like, from their perspective, $1,600 for that display, it should be pretty bare bones.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Saying how much the other display is.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   That's so expensive.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And I think the panel in there is essentially the same as the panel in the LG when it's 2016.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Of course it is.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You know?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   But here's the good news, not to be a pessimistic, to be an optimistic here.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   How great is it that Apple is back to making a bunch of Macs?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   How great is it that Apple is back to refreshing a Mac cycle at appropriate timelines?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And they're making monitors again. It was only five, six years ago when it felt like the Mac was completely dead.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Why did they get out of monitors?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I think there was a miscalculation inside the company, probably around 2015, 2016, where they felt like we have the iPad Pro now.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   We need to focus all of our attention on the iPad, on the iPhone, and really move post, post, back in PC and sort of turn the PC into trucks.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Remember Steve Jobs will eat those about how the PC was eventually going to become a truck.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And so they tried to wind things down, they moved to LG for monitors, the Macbook Pro was turned into like a disaster of a product.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And then their pro audience created a backlash for them.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And if pro users are sort of shifting away from Macs and shifting to Microsoft devices or devices from other companies, they're going to be exposed to new ecosystems.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And that's going to risk Apple's ability to keep selling those people iPhones and AirPods and Apple watches, right?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   The ecosystems are entire packages together. And if you lose one element of the ecosystem, you risk losing your whole ecosystem.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Yeah, we did. In fact, we shifted away from Mac Pros with the final cut to Premiere running on Dell Precision Workstations.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And Microsoft's telling a very good story for developers with WSL and so forth.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I think that's a very real threat. I think Apple probably is wise to pay attention.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Yeah, and it affects not just the pro users, but the schools that look at the pro users and the people that see the behind the scenes and the people who, you know, there's all these things that impact.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Well, trickle down to everything.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Yeah, I mean, if you lose developers, you lose apps.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And I think that Apple constantly is trying, in some cases, they've been successful really only with the phone of having a really healthy ecosystem that builds up around the device.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   So the phone has all these, you know, there's thousands of cases and there's all these little things you can add to it because the market's so big and it's so much the same.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You know, it's the same form factor that's there.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And I think Apple tries to do this in other areas and has not been super successful so that, you know, home kid is a disaster.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   You know, because people aren't, they're doing what all these other companies do, which is I want to be, I want to play like every base I can possibly play, so none of it actually works.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And so, and then the same way monitors never really caught up with what a Mac can do.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Every monitor I have that I've gotten for it, including the LG ones, they're just okay.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Like you're just kind of like, you know, and there's not anything that really fully leverages the Mac and it's always a little, you know, weird.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   So I think that they had to, they had to come back to, you know, owning the entire ecosystem.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Crazy thought and I've heard other people say it.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Maybe you put the A13 in that Apple studio monitor for a touch.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   I don't think so.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Yeah, no, you'd have that you can't because you'd have to put a touch sensor in the screen.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Yeah, and you have to change the surface and then you have to and the big problem is that it does so much, you know, like there's, it works well when you put the gorilla glass in it when it's touching screens.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know, it's that's like a for an artist especially touching their screen is not something that's usually it's like it's like just tapping someone on the forehead over and over again.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You know, so like artists look at that like don't touch my screen.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Like, you know, it's not.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Renee always Renee always said Mark that there were two contingent two kind of warring factions within Apple.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The Johnny I faction, which made the butterfly keyboard and the touch bar and thinner and thinner and lighter and lighter.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And then then the old school folks who really said, you know, you can't forget Mac and that that that old school when you look at the MacBook Pro 14 inch with its HDMI port and no touch bar and a giant escape key that looks like that.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   That old school team one.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Is that your sense of what went on or is it a little more complicated than that?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   That is that is that sounds about right.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   But I think Apple's mistake was letting those be separate factions with the company.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Right.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   But it happens all the time.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   That's what happens at Google.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   So it happened at Microsoft for years.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Right.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But Apple has enough money and resources and different types of customers where there's no reason to have that, you know, attitude of A versus B. You need to have both.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   You need to have a MacBook Air for the people who want that design.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   People who don't need the computer for anything more than Facebook and zoom.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And then you need to have an option, a MacBook Pro for people that need all that stuff.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And this is what Apple is doing.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   What Apple had done five years ago is they had moved entirely into that Johnny Ive direction where the MacBook Pro was essentially a MacBook Air with more premium features tech done.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   But now you have a real MacBook Pro and you have that MacBook Air option for that butterfly keyboard, more futuristic stuff.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   So it should have always been the case where Apple is offering both simultaneously.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   The customer who wants this can buy this.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   The customer who wants that can buy that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And now you have more price points.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   You have more options for consumers.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And I think it's brilliant that Apple realized that they should just be doing both things and offering both and, you know, being there for every customer.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   As an old school Mac guy, I appreciate it.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I'm very, very glad that.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I love this thing. I use the HDMI port on this MacBook Pro every week.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I think MagSafe is great.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   The keyboard is fantastic.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I'm glad the touch bar is gone.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I think the display is ridiculously great.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I have the 16 inch one and I love the big size.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   This is my main computer.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I have not used my iPad Pro basically at all since I've gotten this.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   The reason I was using my iPad Pro a lot was because my previous MacBook Pro was the Intel 2019 16 inch.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's a piece of junk.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   I think the fans were running.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It was a very expensive piece of junk which many of our employees still have.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It is a, but I agree with you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   That's all we can get.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   It's a supporting machine.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Well, I wanted to work on my lap and I would sometimes have to put a towel over my lap.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Well, you can think because it would get hot.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's an Intel problem, right?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   The fans always were running like an airplane.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I'm very happy that Apple moved away from Intel.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I couldn't have more than 10 Chrome tabs open on that Intel machine.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Whereas what I realized is on the iPad, I can have 400 tabs open and it wouldn't blink an eye.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   This was on a, I never got the M1 iPad Pro.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I had the A12X or A12Z, sorry, MacBook Pro, the pandemic edition, the 2020 March iPad Pro with the LiDAR.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That thing flew through everything.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Almost full time on that until this M1 Pro, MacBook.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Wow.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Yeah, because the Intel MacBook Pro, it was a deterrent to getting my work done.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   My poor son has to use one for his TikTok video.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I have to get him in.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Poor guy.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Poor guy.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I remember just to keep in context here, we know we're talking about $2,000 computers here.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   We know our audience are people that understand that's right.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Obviously, there's a lot other important things going on in the world than MacBook Pro processors.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Yes.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   We say that at the beginning of every show and I didn't say it this time.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   This is the Toy Store.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   This is irrelevant compared to the most important things that are going on in the world around
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   us.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   But hey, that's, sometimes people come here for refuge from the real world.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   That's how I always look at it.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I always look at, I look at this whole business as a refuge from reality.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Yeah, we're not telling real stuff.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   It's like when you're a sports fan.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   People are going back and forth over.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Oh my God, Tom Brady didn't retire as if that's important at all.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   But it's a way of letting off some steam and having, you know, that's all it is.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You can't suffer 24/7.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   We're lucky enough to talk about it.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Yes.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And our audience is lucky enough to hear about it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I agree.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   We're very fortunate.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yeah, that's a really good point, Mark.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Thank you for saying that.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   We have a lot more to talk about.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Speaking of suffering.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   iOS 15.4 came out.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   My new Monterey came out 12.3.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   But I couldn't get universal control working.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   I was actually late today because I said I can't come to work without universal control working.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's still not working.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   I don't know.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Maybe you guys can help me.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   We're talking about that.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   We have lots more to talk about.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It's great to have Mark Gurman here from Bloomberg, the power on newsletter.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I must subscribe.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You should all subscribe at Mark Gurman if you've got any.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   What's your number one way to get tips?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Is it through a DM's on Twitter?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Oh, tips on my Twitter bio.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   There's information about Sickle, Wicker, and Telegram.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   There you go.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Email and all that.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   You probably don't have to solicit tips.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   No.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   They just come to you.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   This is not a solicitation.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   It's a forward looking statement.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   You work for Bloomberg now.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   You got to pay attention.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   How has it been going?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   By the way, I think it's been very good for you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yes.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I love it here.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   It's an amazing group and the ability to have like-minded colleagues across the world who
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   am able to work with certainly makes things easier and makes things more reliable.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I love the TV stuff.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I love that I have the flexibility to do things like this.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I do a Twitter spaces now.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Something new.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I'm trying to use a lot of things.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Yeah, so nice.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   You know what?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I'm thrilled.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I see your Twitter spaces set up behind us.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You didn't use that for the show today.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Your camera and your microphone and all that stuff.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Oh, no.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   This is for radio.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   My PC and everything.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Oh, it's a PC.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Oh, never mind.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Yeah, you can't use a PC.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I knew if I was coming on Mac.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I needed to bring out the MacBook Pro.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Pay no attention to this Lenovo Linux desktop I'm sitting in front of.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   What is that?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I was going to ask you.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   So is that a touch?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   What's the deal?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Yeah, it's a touch.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   So when Microsoft came out with the studio, I said, look, this is great.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I can have an all in one that has such a steep angle.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I can have it in front of me so I can have a big screen.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   If Apple would make this, I would do it, but they don't.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   So I guess I could do a Visa mount or something.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Why is Apple not doing something like that?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Here's a funny story.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I've probably been to the Apple headquarters.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Was there a few times for various Apple events?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I was inside a lobby once and I was in the waiting room in a lobby.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.920]   Someone had ordered the Surface Studio.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.480]   This was five, six years ago.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.160]   It was like a Surface Studio.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   The Microsoft version of you have just sitting there.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.440]   I was like, I guess they want to see what's going on with that.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.760]   Six years later, they still don't have a current of product.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.080]   And Microsoft fumbled it.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:56.800]   They've killed it because they put a really low powered CPU in it because I guess the
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.280]   cost was really that screen.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.600]   It was a very nice screen.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.760]   But what they should have done is sold the screen, stand alone, let you run a nook or
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.720]   something more powerful as the desktop.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.040]   So I abandoned that because it really was underpowered.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.760]   This is a Lenovo basically copy of it.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.680]   So that's the yoga.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.600]   Yeah, and it's running Linux, by the way.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.280]   It's not running Windows because I'm not crazy.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.520]   That's a beautiful machine.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   I know.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's perfect for this purpose.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.120]   I'm not sure I'd want it at home.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.200]   Although if you're an artist, maybe more like a, that was Microsoft's idea.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.960]   It was more like a drafting table that you could draw on.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.720]   But I like the something for everyone approach, right?
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.640]   I mean, like, well, that's what PCs are great for.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   Right.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.440]   Unfortunately, but that's the point of, you know, the PC markets, there's thousands of
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   manufacturers.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.280]   You can get any form factor you want.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.800]   Apple can't do that for obvious reasons.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.520]   They have to pick and choose.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   Exactly.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   Let's take a little break.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.320]   I want to show you something actually.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.880]   Our sponsor today is Blue Land, the future of clean has arrived.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.800]   Actually, I'm kind of a Blue Land fanatic.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.480]   If you meet me on the street, I might pull you aside, my buttonhole, and say, have you
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:15.080]   tried Blue Land every year, about five billion plastic, hand soap, and cleaning bottles are
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.800]   thrown away.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Single use bottles.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   You see it.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.400]   You get your cleaning solution and you get your single use bottle and it's done.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.920]   You throw it out and you get a new one.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:31.320]   And if that's not bad enough, the solutions inside those bottles are 90% water.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.760]   So you are shipping water and plastic bottles and then throwing them out.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:42.840]   Blue Land helps you stop wasting water, stop throwing out single use plastics.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.120]   It's a revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.600]   And we have them all over the house.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.360]   This, for example, this is the Blue Land hand soap.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   Really nice, heavy glass.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.520]   It has to be heavy because you're going to pump it, right?
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.480]   And then to fill it up, I love this, you get little tablets.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.720]   So you use your water.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.440]   You don't have to ship the water.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.280]   And by the way, I got the Christmas tablets at Christmas time and they have great sense.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   But that's not all.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.960]   Blue Land does it all.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.320]   You buy one bottle, you refill it forever.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.560]   Here's the, let me take these out.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.920]   These, this is the spritz bottle and they have different colors so you can easily tell
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   one from the other.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   It's nice.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:29.440]   And by the way, be a great gift, house warming gift, bride gift, because you know, you need
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.400]   all this stuff when you first set up a house.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.120]   So this one says bathroom cleaner.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   So you have the, let me find the, oh, here they are.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.400]   These are the, these are the little pellets.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   You get these sent out.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.800]   I actually subscribe so you get them when you need them.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.400]   This is by the way, these are the toilet cleaner ones.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.600]   These are very, very hot.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.200]   Oh, here's the little pellets for the, the cleaner.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.480]   This is how big they are.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.640]   So you fill this up with warm water to the line.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.280]   You drop this in, you let it fizz for a little bit.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.800]   Now you've got cleaner.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.240]   And when you need more, you don't throw the bottle out.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.440]   And this one's a nice lightweight, hard plastic lightweight.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.960]   You don't throw the bottle out.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.520]   You get more tablets.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.560]   This is the, the Blue Land toilet cleaner holder.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.000]   I'll put the toilet cleaner here.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   This by the way, people, they sell these out so fast.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.360]   They love these because you just put it in the toilet.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.200]   Go, go about your other business for a little bit.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.800]   See these little tablets?
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.920]   They fizz for a little while in the toilet.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.240]   Nice lemon scent.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.720]   And then you just brush it out and it's clean.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.880]   So it's a really great solution.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.040]   You get the clean essentials kit that,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.280]   that'll give you everything you need.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.120]   I have more here.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.560]   I have a lot of it.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.160]   The plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.760]   They have something for every inch of your home.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.960]   The toilet tablet cleaners are backed by popular demand.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.480]   They sold out so fast because people said,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.000]   this is the way, this is the way.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.400]   Here's the dish soap we use.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.920]   Instead of using the squirter,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.880]   you shake a little dish soap out.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   (imitates popping)
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   Lisa loves it.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.480]   And we don't, and this is a nice hard rubber container.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.800]   Easy to put in the dishwasher,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.000]   after in between.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.760]   And then you refill it with more dish soap.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.880]   And when they ship it to you, they just ship it like this.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.720]   After you get the container and you just kind of make your own.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.640]   And it's just as good.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.320]   It's exactly, it's really exactly the same.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.880]   What people, I didn't realize is you're 90% water,
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.440]   you're shipping around the country.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.960]   Just so people don't have to put in the dish soap.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.480]   Fill these beautiful, they say, Instagrammable bottles
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.400]   with warm water, pop in one of the hand soap
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.360]   or spray cleaner tablets within minutes.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.240]   You have powerful cleaning products.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.840]   Great sense, Iris agave, Perine Lemon,
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.600]   Lavender Eucalyptus.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.400]   For the hand soap I got the Christmas package.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.120]   I smell like gingerbread one.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.360]   I love it.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   I love it.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.200]   It's so good.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.440]   They have peppermint gingerbread.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.280]   You'll have to wait next Christmas for that.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.240]   From their best selling clean essentials kit
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.040]   to their hand soap duo.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.680]   I actually got two duos so we could have the hand soap
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.240]   at every sink.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.360]   Plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.880]   Blue land has something for every inch of your home.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.520]   It's incredible.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.800]   Blue land's stunning high quality forever bottle
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   started just $10 when you buy a kit.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.360]   They're meant to be reused forever so no plastic waste.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.440]   You gotta try blue land.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.400]   You'll feel good about it.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.240]   You'll love it.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.760]   The planet will thank you.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.480]   It is a much better way of doing this.

[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   Let's see.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.400]   Andy Inaco, I've heard of him, tweets updated my MacBook
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.880]   and iPad Pro for universal control delight.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.840]   I like it so much I'm forcing myself to leave my desk
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.680]   and go to bed.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.560]   I'm too excited about doing an actual work session
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.440]   with this setup and I probably shouldn't stay up
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.360]   until 7 a.m. on a weeknight but.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.240]   And then there's a thread which you didn't even know
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.200]   how long it was gonna be.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.160]   So everybody says it just works.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.000]   You just do it.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.840]   So I update.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.120]   - Oh, okay.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.520]   - Why not for me?
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.040]   What about me?
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.320]   - There's an updated tweet.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.720]   So that was done like when I just had like my MacBook,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.680]   my M1 MacBook and my M1 iPad Pro like on a table
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   in my living room and it was working just as easily
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.200]   as that and just as quickly as that.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.840]   So this morning, I left my iPad, my other iPad Pro,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.880]   like my Gen 1, like 2015 to charge,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.720]   then spent this morning updating it to the least iPad OS
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.440]   could not get it to work on my office.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.960]   - I mean not, good.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   - And I also, so I was figuring that maybe it's maybe,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.160]   it's because it's a Gen 1, I know that it's compatible
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.880]   according to the compatibility list.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.600]   So I tried, okay, well, at least I'll get my M1 working
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.720]   and that doesn't work either.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.040]   I think right now the reason why it wasn't working is that,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.880]   I'm in my office right now.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.920]   So I have my M1 MacBook connected to an external monitor,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.960]   to an external display and with the external display,
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.640]   for some reason it's confusing the hell
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.360]   out of where iPads are and how to connect to them.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.000]   So when I disconnect the external display, it works fine.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.240]   So it's like, okay, that's not ideal.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.720]   I think maybe I should inform Apple
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.200]   that some people do plug external monitors
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.920]   into laptop computers because it is late 1990s by now.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.880]   - Well in their defense, they do say, in fact,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.560]   it even says on the buttons.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.080]   So what we're talking about, universal control,
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.360]   you turn it on, you have to have Monterey, 12.3,
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.680]   you have to have iOS or iPadOS 15.4.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.160]   That was one of the big features
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.440]   and the update turns on this thing
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.100]   that they touted last fall, right?
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.400]   Universal control.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.840]   You can drag your mouse, push, they say, push your mouse
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.440]   through to the other screen on the iPad.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.720]   You're still running iOS, but you can now use your mouse
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.240]   and keyboard with the iPad, push it in the other direction.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.480]   I don't know what you got over there,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.240]   but does it work with an iPhone?
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.720]   I guess presumably it would work with an iPhone, yes.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.200]   - I don't know. - I don't think so.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.440]   - Oh, it has to be, so it's an iPad or a Mac.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.280]   - Okay.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.720]   - I think so, I'd have to double check.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.800]   But yeah, but it's a very, when it was working last night,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.360]   it was a really impressive--
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.800]   - It's cool idea. - It was experienced.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.600]   It just moves, there's in the hesitation,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.800]   there isn't like a Twilight Zone moment.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   It just feels as though it's an external display.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.120]   - You do have to enable it on the Mac, as I remember it's--
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   - On both sides, you do have to--
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.200]   - Yeah, the iPad or whatever other device it is,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.840]   it kind of, it just appears under the displays settings panel.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.640]   So you basically click out a display,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.520]   it will have automatically-- - Oh, maybe that's what I didn't do.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.840]   Okay, maybe. - So I turn it on the switches
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.200]   and then all three of them say beta, beta, beta.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.680]   - Right. - Turn those on,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.120]   but I have to also select the iMac in the air.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.200]   - Well, no, and on your Mac,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.520]   you have to, you have to, in displays,
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.760]   it will appear as an option.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.560]   There'll be a pop-up list of-- - It didn't show up
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.880]   in this place. - It didn't.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.720]   And that's it.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   Are you on the exact same Wi-Fi net?
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.160]   - Same Wi-Fi, I did everything.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.960]   I switched to the other Wi-Fi. - And then I know--
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.400]   - I turned off, I have, I use next DNS,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.000]   I turn that off, I had a iCloud relay,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.080]   I turned that off.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   (laughing)
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.320]   I literally spent an hour messing with it this morning,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.000]   so there's something maybe just not working for me.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.940]   It's a new idea. - We weren't even
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.840]   Dark Souls shoes. - Yeah, that was the problem.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.200]   It's the, I'm wearing white pants after Labor Day.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.320]   There you go, that's the issue.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   - I think that it should be clear that this is not sidecar,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.360]   which allows you to use an iPad as a second display.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.480]   So it becomes an a Mac.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.320]   This, the iPad OS stays the iPad.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.760]   And so you're just really sharing a keyboard and mouse
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.680]   with two different operating systems in effect,
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.040]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.800]   - Yeah, but it works extremely well.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.960]   Like I said, it's not a case of like,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   I've, a lot of us have been using KVM's
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.160]   and whether it's hardware software for a long time.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.720]   It really does feel like you're, excuse me, last night at least,
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.840]   it felt like I was using just one unified workspace.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.920]   To the extent that it, obviously you can drag things
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.360]   from one device to another.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.640]   So highlight text and on the iPad,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.680]   drag it into whatever you want it to go.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.480]   It has a shared clipboard, so you command C on one screen,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.360]   command V on the other one.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.280]   It's, it really, really works well.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.640]   One of the things that I, this, one of the things I liked,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.760]   I thought was a really nice touch back before this morning
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.720]   when the troubles began, was that I accidentally switched it off,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.760]   switched off that feature.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.240]   And so when I tried to move, move my mouse,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.840]   like back into the iPad, it sort of like stretched a,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.760]   a screen into it and stopped as if to say,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.280]   yeah, I see it, I've, it's can properly configured,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.600]   but you told me not to use this as a display.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.240]   So I'm not going to let that happen.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   So that's when you go, oh, boom, that's stupid me
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.520]   and then make that work.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.840]   Also, if you, if it falls asleep and you,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.720]   if it sleeps for some reason and you,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.120]   and you mouse back into it, it will automatically wake
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.400]   the display and restart that.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.360]   So, so it's some nice stuff.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   It just has to work like consistently for everybody.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.960]   I'm just, I'm so disappointed because I, I had, I got out,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.480]   I have like, if I could show you like my,
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.280]   my new setup this morning, I got out like two different
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.520]   like stands at just them and just so I've got,
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.880]   I've got this screen looking like Yoda because this big like block,
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.240]   you think in the middle and two sticky outy ears on the side.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.000]   And like, oh, this was going to be so cool.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.600]   Because it really, so what's the use?
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   So what's the use use use?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.480]   The use cases for me, I could immediately see like,
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.760]   like in a show like this, I also need to sort of keep an eye
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.000]   on a couple of things.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.480]   Like I, if there's, if there's an emergency that comes in
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   through Slack or through Discord or through messages
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.480]   or through email, I'm not going to bail out of the pod.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   I think I failed to select this.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   This is the display that you will see on your Mac.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   This is the display control panel.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   Under Add Display, by the way, Sidecar still works.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   This is for Mac Rumors.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   You'll see your Sidecar displays,
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   which it says Mirror or Extend to,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   but you'll also see a new entry,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Link, Keyboard and Mouse,
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   and that's the universal control.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   Maybe I might have hustled through.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   They don't really give you a step-by-step on how to do this.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   There's a number of things you have to do.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   You have to enable it.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   You have to make sure you're on the same iCloud account,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   the same Wi-Fi account.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   Bluetooth has to be turned on.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   They did release a video,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   but it's one of those,
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   "Hey, everything's going to work perfectly.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   There's no need for us to tell you how to troubleshoot everything
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   because there's no chance whatsoever this is not going to work."
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   I don't have to do anything on the iPad,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   but Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Handoff all have to be turned on.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   You do have to enable something in the iPad,
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.480]   but it's on by default.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   It was on by default for me when I installed 12.4.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   I think it's in sharing,
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   but presumably once you've got it all turned on,
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   it's under AirPlay and Handoff in Settings.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   You make sure the cursor and keyboard parentheses beta is switched on.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.480]   That's it.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   It's a good example of Apple using a variety of technologies
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   that they've been building in over time to do something cool and interesting.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   For someone like me, I have multiple computers.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   Not yet.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   I have to admit that I'm still unwinding.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   I got into synergy, and I was like,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   "Okay, this is much better than KVM."
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   I trashed one of my M1s and I'm still trying to get it to work right.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   It's never been the same.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   So, synergy just drove it into the ground.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   I've literally never seen a Mac damaged so badly ever.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   You can't just rebuild it and it all works again.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   No, I rebuilt it and it's still funky.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   I'm going to try to grind it all the way down,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   but it's the...
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   I'm trying to do firmware updates now.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   That's the next thing.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   I don't have a lot of time to work on it.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   So, it just sits there right now waiting for me to get back to it
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   because it's a lot of work.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   What happened was I dragged a hard drive and I was like,
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   "I'll just get it over to the corner here."
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   It just got a little over the edge between two computers.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   It went into a race condition where literally I could restart it
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   plug hardware into the computer and it still couldn't see it.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   Like, this keyboard and mouse wouldn't work.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   Oh my gosh, Siri.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   So, anyway, but...
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   Siri wants to help.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   She's trying to help.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   I found help on the web anyway.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   So, I was like, "Well, we have to take synergy off of everything
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   and never use it again."
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   So, I'm using KV...
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   I'm back to KVM waiting for this to come.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   And because of my synergy experience, I'm kind of like,
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.480]   "I'm going to wait for a little while and just see
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   what happens and just stay with my KVM."
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   But I'm super excited about it actually working with my studio.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   I'll have three Mac minis and a Mac studio all on my desk
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   and I've got lots of monitors.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   And so, it's just a matter of being able to figure out where they all go.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   Hey, synergy.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   No, I thought maybe that.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   [laughter]
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   I think Siri was just worried.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.480]   She was just worried about me.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   Sorry.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   Well, I have now wanted to go home right now.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   Go ahead, Mark.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   Yeah, I've got a question for Andy.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   So, let's say you have an iPad with a mouse connected or an iPad
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.480]   and a magic keyboard with the trackpad.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   Can you use that to control the Mac over universal control?
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   Or is it only any other direction?
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   It's supposed to go both ways, isn't it?
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   I remember seeing a demo that it went both ways.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.480]   It's...
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   I did see that in a demo.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   Everything that I've been trying has been...
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   There is one Mac that acts as sort of the truth for the entire network
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   and then that extends to everything else.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   I haven't started really abusing it yet,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.480]   partly because of my failure this morning.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   For one thing, one thing I want to know is that,
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   let's say that I'm in a coffee shop and my Wi-Fi...
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   And both my MacBook and my iPad are both connected to the Starbucks Wi-Fi,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   but I'm connecting through a VPN.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   Will they still be able to talk to each other because Wi-Fi...
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   Even if you have your Mac connection to the Internet
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   and the rest of your home network or Office network via Ethernet,
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.480]   you still have to have that Wi-Fi connection for it to reach out
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   and find other compatible devices and connect to them.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   So I don't know whether that would still work with a VPN.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   I don't even necessarily know if it will work well over a public Wi-Fi.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   So there's still things I need to...
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   I think everybody's going to try to start beating up on it,
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   beta or no, just to find its failure points.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   But here's another question.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   So let's say you're using a Mac trackpad to control an iPad
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   and you want to do the iPad adjuster.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   Do you do the iPad adjuster or do the Mac adjuster?
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   If you're...
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   Right, the truth is where the mouse pointer is.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   When you move the mouse pointer into the iPad, for instance,
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   the Mac menu bar dims out, the cursor for the iPad turns into the iPad cursor,
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   and now any gesture that you make on the Magic Trackpad
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   or on your MacBooks trackpad is pinch and zoom,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   pinch and stretch, work perfectly fine.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   All the multiple fingertip features work perfectly fine.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.480]   It really is.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   The trackpad turns into the screen of the iPad in terms of input.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.480]   Got it.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   Cool.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   I'll have to give it a shot.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   It's surprising that I haven't tried it yet.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   But...
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   I imagine, I don't know, but I imagine like Renee that you're on betas of everything.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   And so it's a little tricky for you to do stuff like this.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   Time is limited, right?
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   So much going on.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   I mean, I just...
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   One of the reasons I don't do the Mac OS and iPad OS betas,
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   or iOS betas, is because I want to kind of experience it as a normal human would.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   Yeah, my problem was this is one of the features that I've been sorely looking forward to
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   for an entire year.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   And unfortunately, the only Mac that I owned that was compatible with this was the only M1 Mac.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   The only Mac that I have that is like less than five years old.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   Well, that's cool.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   And I could not jeopardize it with the developer preview of anything.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   If you responded to your tweets, well, I can't get it running on my 5K 2014 5K iMac.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   No, you can't because you need Monterey 12.3 to do this.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   And I have several...
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   In fact, it's really Apple's way nudging us to all get Mac studios.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   You really would be much happier if you only had a Mac studio.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   My office computer can't go to Monterey, Lisa's computer at home can't go to Monterey.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   So that's two Mac studios we've purchased.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   Mark, does Apple give you review?
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.480]   No, they probably...
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   You're probably persona non-grata there, right?
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   I don't know if I'm persona non-grata.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   I don't have any review unit to the new stuff.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   I also haven't asked for any review unit.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   I don't bother asking because I know they wouldn't.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   So I don't bother.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   So I just buy it.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   I just buy it.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   I don't mind.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   I made a money.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.480]   I got plenty of money.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.480]   I don't need...
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   The Mac studio.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   How much of people's willingness to purchase a Mac studio is based on the name?
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   What if they call it the Mac mini Mac mini?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   No, the studio is a much better name.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   Yes.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   I agree.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   It's less sexy, right?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   So it's like...
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   I think it's their naming.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   It's their marketing.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   That's really so...
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.480]   When did you hear the words studio?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   What do you mean?
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   Like the day...
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   You reported the rumor the day before, so...
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   Oh, a few days before.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   A few days before.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   See, it's my theory.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.480]   And again, certainly don't want to get you in touch with anybody.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.480]   And I'm not in any way...
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   I have no knowledge of how anybody works in this field.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   But it's my sense that you hear stuff about stuff in production.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   You always have to say, "Well, is that going to be released?
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   And is it going to be released when?"
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   And then, like the Apple car or...
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   I don't know when's that going to come out.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   But then there's also, especially as you get really close to an event, like a couple of days before,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   you had to bring in third party contractors, people like Alex, to shoot all of that stuff.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   Alex Apple doesn't do that stuff in house.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   No, they bring in people.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   I think they have a lot of...
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.480]   They've talked about it in the past.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.480]   They've talked about it in the past.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   They do a lot of it in house.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   They have their own studios for their commercials.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   Well, that would be a reason to do it because you can control your employees and make you like control for parties.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   That's why they do that.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   Well, it's also cheaper, right?
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   It's also cheaper.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   I don't think it's cheaper.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   I don't think it's cheaper.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:54.480]   Unless you do 20 events a year, it's not cheaper because you've got all these people sitting around waiting till next time.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   But no, you've got to get those studios.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   You could use studios like that for a lot of things.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   There's lots of communication that goes out from Apple that isn't a keynote.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Many years ago...
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   So, let's generate content for a lot of things.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   And I worked in it, so I know it exists right next to the original campus at Apple TV studio, which they sold.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   They got rid of.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   They didn't use it.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.480]   They leased it out because there wasn't enough business to keep all those technicians busy.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   But that was the pre-video.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   That was the pre-video is the future kind of world.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   We did it now.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   We did it now.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:35.480]   There in 1994 for CNBC because Genes Smith and I, and Jim Lanterback, because Apple wasn't using it.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   In fact, CKE has it moved in there.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   There's a huge amount of content that's created for YouTube, that's created for internal communication.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   That's why the external communications...
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   There's a lot of things that we don't know.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   Okay.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   So maybe...
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   I just thought, there's going to be some sound guy.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   It's different.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   It saw the studio.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   It's called the studio.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   It's going to...
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.760]   I mean, the thing is, is that when you have a live stage event that's much harder because
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.480]   you have rehearsals and so on and so forth that are going on.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:16.000]   So that's typically for most companies, that is an external company that comes in and does
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.360]   your stage stuff.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.160]   That's a specialty that you don't want to keep.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.680]   That truly is something that you don't want to keep on staff.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.040]   So you hire, it's a broadcast truck and it's a thing.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.480]   There's a whole bunch of stuff that comes in for...
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.320]   This is for Apple or Google or Facebook or...
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   Anybody.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   You know, so they'll do that.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   Now that's where a lot of rumors can happen because it's very porous.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.040]   I mean, like if you go to some of these, they give you stickers that you have to put on
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.800]   top of your phone on your...
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   Your camera.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.920]   You know, different companies will put on it.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.160]   But you ask for one phone, you put one sticker on who says the person doesn't have three
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.160]   phones.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.440]   So the thing is, it's a cert.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.520]   It does what it does do is it does tell the crew, "Hey, we're looking for those stickers."
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.720]   If you pick up your phone and look like, "And we don't see a sticker, we're going to be
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   upset."
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.320]   But that's where things start to happen.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.680]   And I think that usually you're working with trusted contractors.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.760]   A lot of these companies won't work with contractors.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   They don't trust.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.520]   And as a contractor, you know, it's pretty much the end of your business with that company
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.840]   if something gets out.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:21.600]   So most of the contractors stay pretty tight, but everybody worries about that.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.040]   But I think that's where you see more leaks is when you're doing a live event.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.040]   Apple's not doing those.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.760]   So those are recorded all in a studio or a series of studios.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   Yeah, that they can control.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   They're laid out.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.320]   They're playing them out.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.920]   So who did this set?
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.120]   This is a set.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:39.520]   You'll recognize this from the section where they showed how creatives are using the studio.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:44.240]   Because now I might be wrong, but look very closely at this plant.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.840]   I think that's in a Mac Pro pot.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.000]   I think that's a repurposed...
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.160]   Am I wrong?
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.440]   I think that's a repurposed Mac Pro.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   It depends.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.280]   It doesn't look like it's overheating.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   Look at the bottom.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   That's the giveaway.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   If you ask me.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.520]   Am I wrong?
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.440]   No, that's a little Easter egg.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.480]   It's kind of a funny...
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.160]   I can see Apple throwing that in just aha ha.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.160]   Remember that?
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.040]   We found a good use for it just to hollow it out.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.440]   Oh man.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.280]   It does though when you look at that and you look at how big that studio is.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.800]   That really is a fat boy.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   Look at that thing.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   That is a chubby hubby.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   That's really...
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.520]   If that really is it, that's harsh.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   That's harsh.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.520]   That's like...
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.520]   Wow.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.160]   I'll put your make a planter out of your own.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.160]   I might be wrong.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.160]   I don't know.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.160]   I saw this on Reddit.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.000]   I thought, "It does look like a Mac Pro."
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.400]   Anyway.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.840]   Oh, I have so many things I want to ask Mark.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.440]   Let's go.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   Let's do it.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   Okay.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.520]   If I don't want to jeopardize your sources or anything, obviously.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.680]   What do you think of this Ming-Chi quote guy though, really?
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   Sorry.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   Well, no.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.560]   For me, I forget I said that.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   No, you can go ahead.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.560]   Go ahead.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.560]   Answer if you want.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.560]   I just...
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.560]   He's not my source.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   Right.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.560]   No, I know he's not.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   But yeah.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.560]   Clearly.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.040]   I tend to respect everyone.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.720]   You would never say anything.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:26.760]   He is saying today that Apple has to, must, must reorganize its Apple Card Team if they want
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.640]   to meet their 2025 production goal.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.280]   It's funny because I wrote those exact words in January.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   Oh.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   Really?
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:40.380]   Well, what happened was is Apple had this Apple Card Management Team that it built up under
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:46.440]   Doug Field and they sort of built it up and everything was fine until the end of 2019.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.560]   It was pretty stable.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:55.120]   And then this management team of the 10, 15 people under Doug Field, Doug Field was the
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.560]   head of engineering for Elon Musk Tesla.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:03.120]   He oversaw Google programs for Model 3 and a few other of their products.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   Big acquisition.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   Huge.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Big hire for Tesla.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   That's right.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   And then Big hire for Apple.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   To get him back.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   Get him back.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:16.760]   And over the course of 2020, into...
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:26.840]   Of cross 2020 and 2021, nearly every single leader on the Apple Card Team left over that
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.840]   two years span.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.480]   The entire leadership team, the entire top layer of the Apple Card program in Apple left
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.800]   the company over a two year period, including Field himself for Ford.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.040]   A few of those people actually went to flying car or flying taxi startups.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.080]   And my joke is they guess they find it more likely that they'll be able to release a flying
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.640]   car than an Apple Card.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.080]   That drives on the wheels.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:58.520]   So they are having a make it or break it type of year where they need to figure out who
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.160]   is going to run different teams, who's going to be in charge of this thing.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.840]   It's basically now the second layer of the company has become the top layer.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.040]   It's like a full succession.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.680]   They wiped out the whole management team.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.520]   Now everyone has stepped up.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.560]   It's run now by Kevin Lynch, who ran WatchOS.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:23.240]   He's the only guy at Apple who, from start to finish, developed an entire new operating
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:27.440]   system, an entire new product being the Apple Watch and WatchOS.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.400]   So you know, the WatchOS, the Apple Watch, it's pretty mature.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.760]   It's pretty successful at this point, right?
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.760]   And so I guess the bet is that if he did that, he can do what he did for the Watch for
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.280]   cars, obviously a car on a WatchOS two completely different beasts.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.360]   I think they'll probably need to get some classic car people in there too.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.680]   Best, best guest.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.720]   Do you think they're actually going to build a car?
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.920]   Absolutely.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.480]   My best guest is they will announce a car probably between 2025 and 2026.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   That's crazy.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.760]   I zeroed out.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:06.200]   Unless something has changed in the last hour, I'm pretty certain that they'll come.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.160]   I think this is the solution that they're going to do this.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:08.680]   Wow.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.800]   I think what's interesting is also the changing role of a car for a lot of people in the sense
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   that when you're trying to build something for two or three years and you have to look
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.480]   at kind of the pulse of what people want.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.520]   And I think that when Waymo did something without a driver seat, it looked crazy.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.920]   I know that what the market that I'm in is I want a box that drives by itself and has
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.280]   things that I can do inside of it.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   I don't want to drive.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.480]   I don't want to sit anywhere that's driving.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.080]   I don't want to have any of those things.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.360]   And so when I talk to people, they're like, "Oh, yeah, that's what I want."
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.200]   So I think that it's an interesting puzzle to figure out where it's going.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.680]   It's a moving target, though, you admit.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.600]   And what you want is not necessarily.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:59.600]   No, but when you're not driving, if you're building a driverless software, you're fine.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.080]   I want to--
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.560]   My wife calls it an "oh, shoot handle."
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.720]   Not exactly that.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.560]   I want a button to disengage.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.520]   I want something.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.480]   I don't want to end up in a container ship on the way to China.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   It's very scary.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   It's self-driving stuff.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   Thank you.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   But even the Tesla autopilot, I mean--
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   Oh, it's terrifying.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   --you can talk to time.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   My hands are on that wheel.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   It's very terrible.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.880]   They-- I mean, they say they want you to.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.800]   But even with the-- on my Mach-E, I'm getting the blue cruise, which is Ford's hands off.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.680]   You know I'm all keep my finger.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   I'm kind of there, just in case.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.400]   And I'm not going to logo read a book.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.800]   I'm going to be kind of scanning at all times.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:47.440]   So do you have the full FSD or just the standard autopilot on the Tesla?
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.040]   I no longer have a Tesla.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040]   And so I'm going to experience this FSD.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.040]   I have a Mach-E, a Ford Mustang Mach-E.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040]   How is that?
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.040]   I'm seeing it all over LA.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040]   Love them.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   Love them.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   Yeah, they're beautiful.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   They're great.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.400]   They're basically-- I had a Model X, which I traded in for this, basically.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.840]   And it's basically their Model X.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   But it doesn't have FSD and Ford and GM say, we're not going to do FSD.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   In fact, they're the blue cruise and GM's version of that only work on highways they've
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.680]   already scanned.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.040]   They don't work on city streets.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.400]   They're very cautious as you know, they probably should be.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.920]   That's where-- where Elon has an advantage, he's willing to play a little fast and loose.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   Yeah, he's not-- he's not a conservative at all.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.800]   He can roll through stop signs until they tell him not to.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:42.320]   So it's crazy because on the autopilot on the Tesla, it just rolls through the stop sign,
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   right?
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.880]   The end-- and Nitzi is making them turn that off, by the way.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.880]   You're going to get an update.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   Sorry.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.040]   It doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.920]   It actually makes sense to me, the role.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.480]   Because you would do that.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   I mean, it's illegal.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.920]   And you get a ticket even if your Tesla does it.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.480]   But if the Tesla knows there's nobody else, it can see.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   Why should I come to a full stop?
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.560]   I'm like, I'm going to slow down.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.600]   I'm going to just pause, but I'm not going to come to a full stop because there's nobody
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   here.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   I can see that.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   Oh, I see.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   I see.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   I see.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   So that's when it doesn't--
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   Elon Musk is just making his own rules.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600]   That's the problem.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600]   It is against the law.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   It's technically called a California stop.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Stop.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   You know, like it is a California stop.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   Like it's-- so we're in California.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.560]   See, that's the problem with machine learning it.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.960]   It will pick up every single percolivity of the human data set that's providing it.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.760]   So basically, if it learns how to drive from people who also don't look to see if there's
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.680]   a bicyclist coming before their roll through a stop sign, then all 12 driving cars will
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.920]   also not look to see if there's a bicyclist.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   That's exactly what the complaint was and why Nitzi changed it is pedestrians and bicyclists.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:55.560]   The car is known to miss-- I mean, I've seen videos of the car actually of a Tesla veering
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.400]   toward a bicyclist.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.600]   So this is not a solved problem.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:10.480]   I just really am offended by how absolutely-- what disregard for proper testing Tesla has
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:16.040]   and all of their products because there are things that they're supposed to do when they're
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   operating in California.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.880]   They're not supposed to enable full self-driving at all without getting permission from an
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.680]   office in the California state government.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.600]   They're also the one company that's doing self-driving and high level assisted driving
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.800]   that seems to think that cameras are the only thing that you absolutely need, which
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.520]   is great if they figured out something that absolutely nobody else in the entire industry,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.080]   theoretical and practical have figured out.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.080]   But it actually looks more like they are trying to convince themselves of something that I
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.840]   guess that they made five years ago and trying to stick with it when actually it's not going
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.920]   to work.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.680]   And this is why I trust so many other companies so much more than I trust Tesla because if
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:02.160]   they're playing fast and loose on these things that are so easy to comply with, I have absolutely
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.560]   no faith whatsoever that they're going to work all that hard to make sure that they get
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.680]   to that final critical 2%.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.480]   That's going to be the difference between a faith-filled and trustworthy and safe self-driving
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.440]   experience and one that's just good enough that you can charge someone a thousand bucks
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.440]   a month for it.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.920]   Well, and when I'm saying that number one is I'm not saying that I would be ready to have
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.520]   a self-driving car today, but what Apple has to do is look four years out.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.560]   If we look four years back and assume that we have trajectory of four years out, you're
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.600]   going to get to a point where, especially if Apple's doing an Apple, probably a little
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.640]   bit more risk-averse than Tesla, that we're going to end up with something that may not
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.160]   work everywhere but we'll work in a lot of places.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.320]   And again, I don't see myself in my future doing any significant travel if I don't
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   if I have to drive.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.480]   It's just a waste of time.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.960]   So, until it starts to normalize again, and I think that there's a precipice probably
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:03.280]   20, 26 to 20, 30 that statistically it will be safer to be in a self-driving car than
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.880]   a have a person drive it.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.600]   I mean, from the average person, when I drive on the highway, you see people, they're on
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.680]   off its cellphone, eating a Big Mac while driving.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.120]   It's not that much safer than a computer.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.520]   The only job is to do this.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:26.640]   With that, without turning this into self-driving week, in a weekly, the other, there's an interesting
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.920]   field of opinion that says that they're going to be limits to how much more safe a self-driving
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   car system can be over humans chiefly because when self-driving car performance will cite
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:47.040]   federal safety guidelines that basically say that 97% of all traffic accidents are driver
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.400]   fault accidents.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.080]   But the thing is, it doesn't factor in why did that person make the wrong decision.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.320]   And a lot of people who are experts on how traffic is set up, how streets are set up,
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.480]   how cities are set up, are saying that signage is bonkers.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.000]   The way that streets are laid out is bonkers.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.040]   There's so many instances in which you would be very, very hard-pressed to make the right
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.240]   decision more than 80% of the time.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.560]   When you make the wrong decision, you don't necessarily always get into a wreck.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.360]   So basically, you're going to be putting these self-driving car systems into the same failed
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.320]   infrastructure with bad signs, signs of it knocked down, signs that are being covered
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.760]   by branches, intersections where it is, there's a sign that says clearly what you're supposed
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.960]   to do when you come to the stop line, but the layout of the road doesn't make it clear
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.680]   that this is a right-hand turn or whether this road is just sort of forking off to one
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   side.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.880]   So what light are you stopping for?
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.240]   What light are you turning for?
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.400]   So there's a whole lot left to be proven about this technology.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.960]   And so that's why I'm not really very bullish on it right now because right now we're at
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.920]   the Mercury, there's Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, we are barely at the start of Mercury, maybe
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.040]   in the middle of Mercury.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.520]   We are a long way from London on the moon.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:04.160]   Mark, is there a reason they have a basketball next to your name on appletrack.com?
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.680]   Is that your official logo?
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   That's funny.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   It's a little basketball, right?
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.680]   I tweet a lot about the Lakers.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680]   They know you.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.840]   The Lakers are a big disappointment.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.040]   I can't get over them.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.840]   Have you seen winning time yet on HBO all about the...
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.840]   I haven't had a chance.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.840]   It's so good.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.840]   So my list I want to watch, it's good.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.540]   Adam McKay, yeah.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.800]   It's an Adam McKay style thing.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.160]   They break the fourth wall all the time.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.240]   They stop and explain things, but I'm really enjoying it.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.240]   It's pretty good.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.000]   It's all about the 80s Lakers, the Magic Johnson era.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.400]   I will prioritize Magic Johnson.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   What a guy.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.720]   I ran into a once at a burger shop in LA.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   He just...
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   Everyone.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.320]   He would just take the time for everyone to take a picture of everyone.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   Wow, that's neat.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   Guys, amazing.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.960]   He's not like he has a non-trougher bodyguards behind him.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.320]   It's just everyone loves magic in LA.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:02.080]   I'm sad he walked off on the Lakers a couple of years ago, but he got us LeBron James and
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   maybe he'll be back.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.840]   It's pretty much, at least so far.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.800]   I think I've only seen two episodes because it's a week by week thing from HBO.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.400]   But it's pretty much about Jerry Bus, about him buying it from Cook and a dying team and
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   turning it around.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.400]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.800]   If you're a Lakers fan, I think you're probably a must.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   I must see.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.640]   I guess someone else needs to buy the Lakers now because they're dying team again.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.640]   Oh my God.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:33.320]   Hey, anyway, 86.4% on AppleTrack.com.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   You were a little higher.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.640]   It goes up and down all the time.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.360]   I think that's a little low, to be honest.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.760]   I think you deserve more.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   It should be 100%.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760]   100%.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   100%.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.000]   You were right on the monitor.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.280]   You were right on the studio.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   I don't know.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.520]   Some of these, there's a, I guess the hourglass means it remains to be seen.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:01.920]   You got a lot of remains to be seen, which to me is a very good indicator of how prescient
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.320]   you are, how good your sources are.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.200]   You named March 8th.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.560]   When German says March 8th, then we go, okay, it's March 8th.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.480]   We knew that.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   And I'm excited.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.040]   So what do you think for a WWDC?
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.920]   You think that's when they'll announce the M2 MacBook Air?
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.800]   Those machines are supposed to come out between May and June, right?
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.160]   So, you know, I'm making the leap here saying that I think that it'll probably be announced
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.600]   at WWDC, right?
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.200]   I mean, if you can hold off three weeks to announce it.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   You might as well.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   You might as well.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.680]   But it may have been a few weeks before, maybe a few weeks after.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.120]   A peak at a Mac Pro.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.280]   Like stay tuned guys, it's coming now.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.840]   You wouldn't want to do that because you'd kill the sales of the studio.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.520]   I don't know.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.680]   Originally their plan was to announce the Mac Pro at WWDC.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.560]   If they shifted away from the M1 core, to the Mac Pro, to an M2 core, maybe it's something
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.280]   they preview in the fall and release early next year.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.760]   M2 is interesting.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.120]   With the Mac Pro.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.560]   I think I'm wondering if they didn't say a word about M2.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.200]   Did you think they might March 8th?
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.040]   I think it was a, I thought it was a possibility because from what I've seen, what they're
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.640]   doing now is they're testing the M2 Mac chips against all the apps on the Mac apps.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.680]   What they do before these computers come out is they do testing.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.960]   Yeah, we've seen it on Geekbench, right?
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   Available apps.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.680]   And so I have seen from a few developers reached out to me to let me know that they
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.840]   have started seeing the M2 chip in their analytics logs.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.200]   And the M2 chip in the developer logs is exactly what I reported would be a year and a half
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.160]   ago, which is it's an eight core CPU.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.000]   The same is today and then up to a 10 core GPU.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.720]   So up to two additional cores on the GPU.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.320]   Now with a binning and different configurations that might fall down to nine, but it's basically
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.480]   an eight core CPU, 10 core GPU, a little bit faster on the CPU side.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.760]   And the main change is moving from an A14 infrastructure to an A15.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.400]   I'm concerned that my confused customers, we spend a lot of time talking about why the
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.680]   M2, the initial M2 release is more like the initial M1 release than it is like a higher
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.280]   end M1.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.520]   People might kind of say, oh, but that's the next generation.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.600]   So it's going to be faster and better.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.160]   And I think that might be a little confusing to people where they've been building up up
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.040]   up and now we're going to take a steps down and go back up up up up up.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.280]   That's that TikTok thing that Intel does.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.280]   And I'm wondering.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.560]   And that's where Apple's marketing will have to come in and just sell it.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.240]   Do some heavy lifting, right?
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.520]   Because maybe, you know what, just maybe they call the what's actually from a technical
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.240]   perspective in M2, maybe they call that an M1 X.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.480]   Yeah, that's what I would do.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.600]   Yeah, something we know it's a 15, but don't if you call them to with this, that's one
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.080]   better than an M1.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.000]   Yeah, I still think they call it the M2, but definitely you raise a really nice point.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.840]   And it would, I think either way, would make sense.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:12.400]   In the past, they've they've had the situation where they've had like an A, you know, 14
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.040]   X, right, or an A12 X or an A10 X, right?
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.360]   So they've done the Xs before.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   The sort of differentiate.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   You see, right?
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.480]   You know, Apple gets the big bucks for their marketing prowess, right?
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.880]   So we'll see what they come up with and how they phrase it all.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.640]   They're very good at that.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:39.440]   Among other features in the new iOS, 123 new emoji designs.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   This is from emoji patrol.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.200]   The troll, there's like a whole bunch of them.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   And there's a troll.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200]   There's a troll.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   You need a troll.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   We had a troll.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.200]   There's a troll.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.040]   There's a lips that are going, I don't know what are they doing.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]   They're biting me.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.720]   Is that kind of sexy lips?
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.080]   There's magic beans.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.120]   There's pregnant men, which would take magic beans.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.280]   There are, well, there's some weird stuff.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:07.040]   I like the melting emoji, like the melting happy face, like, hmm.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.320]   That's the ketamine emoji or something.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.280]   I don't know what that is.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:18.200]   I always think that updates to emojis is such a great insight into how the world society
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200]   is changing.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.200]   Yes.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.600]   It's one of the few true international languages and that they're designed to communicate concepts
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.280]   and ideas to the exact same audience, the exact same medium.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:35.920]   And so when you see things like all of the internal debate that went down to, what's
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.000]   been referred to as the pregnant man emoji, of course, conservative websites, we're like,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   oh, let's see.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   The clueless, clueless tech, liberal tech people are trying to enforce their will.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.800]   I don't know if you've read all the conversation that went in on the commission about that.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.520]   Yeah, because Apple does not decide this.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.720]   This comes from the Unicode consortium from the emoji pan commission.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.320]   But they can customize them.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320]   Yes.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.800]   Don't they get as a verbal description and a suggestion and then they make it their own?
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   It's a person.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.960]   This is exactly why they came out with this new edition because after the first wave of
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.240]   emoji, once they come out with standards, one of the standards that they that they defined
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.400]   was that there are no men or women emoji.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.560]   There are people emoji and then male or female.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.400]   So it's the pregnant person.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   Right.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.720]   So someone pointed out that, well, gee, we have pregnant women, which is one of the
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.000]   re one of the original emoji.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.520]   What do we do about this?
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.400]   Do we officially codify this as an exception to that rule?
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]   Do we expand the rule?
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.320]   Do we do we redefine it as person with expanded belly?
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:52.480]   That's and so it was it was it was it was it was it was approved in 2021 September as part
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.680]   of emoji 14.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.640]   And and emoji P as quick to point out, sometimes used in just to represent feeling too full
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.320]   after overeating as in a food baby.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.520]   Here's Apple's rendition.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.520]   I I Google's I thought it was like I thought I was like, I have deli belly deli belly.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.200]   I'll be using that emoji a lot.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.880]   It's going to be a big one for me.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   They've changed.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:23.080]   They've added some new smiley faces, including the melty face, peaking peekaboo.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.320]   If you had the if you had the one with the hand over its face and the belly belly through
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320]   the nose.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.680]   Yeah, whoops, that's just that's a that's a way of saying oops.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.160]   Interesting tweak.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.240]   Now that now the shaking hands emoji, you can change the skin color of each of the hands
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.240]   as a pair.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   Yes.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240]   As a pair.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.240]   Oh, I really like that.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.240]   Yeah, notice.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.720]   Right hand shaking hands.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.920]   I think that's really cool.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.000]   It's just more as you say, Andy, it's more expressive, it's about expressive.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   The face holding back tears, which is I call the anime emoji or the the keen emoji.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.320]   I like the sideways mouth.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.640]   That's faced with diagonal mouth.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:11.280]   Let's see what else we have face with open eyes and hand over mouth.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.880]   This apple actually was the inspiration for that replacing face with hand over mouth.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.240]   As you mentioned, there's a troll.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.440]   What do they call these lips?
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440]   There's a troll.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.440]   It's cute.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.920]   I want to know what they call these lips though.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.600]   The troll emoji's design was changed between the release of 15 for beta and today's release.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.440]   As you can see, it's smiling now.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.200]   In the beta, the nose was so big you couldn't tell if it was grimacing, smiling, growling.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.240]   Now we know they've shrunk the nose and you can see it's smiling and smug, so satisfaction.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.240]   It's a happy, happy troll.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.160]   Just think about how many meetings there were to make that troll.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]   That's got you.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.160]   It's a whole team.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.840]   It's like a whole team and there's like a guy that has to build a 3D model of it and
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.440]   there's lots of things there.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.280]   We now have some Italian hand gestures.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.160]   I think we get the one that is it the snapping the thing?
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.920]   It's called hand with index finger and thumb crossed.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.160]   I guess it just depends where you're from.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.560]   The gesture known as a finger heart was popularized in the 2010s by South Korean celebrities.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.840]   K-pop stars, actors, comedians.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.080]   It can also be used.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.640]   You've seen this where you're rubbing the two fingers together like money.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.720]   It can indicate luxury or an expensive item.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.200]   As Andy points out, it's just expressive.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.400]   If you look at Apple's rendering of it, it's not quite as expressive as Google's.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.640]   Apple knows what money is.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   Google's really...
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.280]   I feel like Google's almost...
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.360]   They should put little lines as the fingers are moving or something.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.000]   Well, if there's one company that understands the value of communication with communicating
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   to people with fingers crossed, it's going to be Google's.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.800]   It's like 20 words for snow.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.000]   Heart hands.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.080]   We have heart hands now, the influencer's favorite gesture.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.320]   As you pointed out, Andy, you can vary the skin tone, which is really great in the hand
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.800]   shakes.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.080]   I think the green with three fingers would be really great.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.800]   You should have a Shrek hand.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.640]   Let's see.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.280]   What else?
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.480]   There's magic beans.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.200]   What's the hand with the eye?
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.800]   That's like a Hindu thing, right?
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   What is that?
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   Let's see.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.720]   They've got coral, lotus, empty nest, nest with eggs.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.720]   It's a hamsa.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.720]   It's from Judaism.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   Hamsa.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   Oh, it's Judaism.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.720]   It's a hamsa.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.720]   All right.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.520]   A blue hand with an eye in the center, the hamsa, ancient symbol, important to multiple
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.360]   religions, including Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity, represents luck, protection,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.960]   guidance, feminine power, and faith.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.160]   It's kind of a cool thing.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.160]   I don't know.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160]   It's funny.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.440]   Apple got it right because of hamsa, like when you look at it in real life, it looks sort
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.480]   of like the Apple one, whereas the Google and the Twitter ones, it's not.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   It looks like that.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   Maybe they're doing the Buddhist one.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480]   Yeah, they went.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   So that's interesting.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.280]   I didn't realize it was a judeica.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.760]   That's interesting.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.080]   There's a crutch.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.520]   There is a Apple ID card.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.240]   I don't know why you'd need that.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.960]   Joe Apple seed.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.120]   There's a quality sign.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.600]   There's bubbles.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   Playground slide.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   Wheel, ring buoy.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.120]   X-ray.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.000]   Heavy equals sign.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.920]   That's called the heavy equals sign.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.600]   Of course, you have equal signs.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.160]   You don't need one, especially.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.600]   But they're already, apparently, whereas a heavy multiply, heavy plus, heavy minus,
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.760]   and heavy divide, man.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.320]   So now there's a heavy equals.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.400]   Google even gave it a little highlighting there.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.360]   Anyway, you'll get that with iOS 15.4.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.840]   The other thing I was surprised I had to redo face ID.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.440]   On my phone.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:02.600]   And that's because now it's a little late, but better late than ever.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.680]   Face ID works with a mask.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.520]   But apparently, they have to redo it so that they really pay attention to your eyes.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.400]   In fact, they give you a second option to do it with glasses.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   And they say, "You should do it with every kind of glasses that you wear every pair,
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   except sunglasses.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   It won't work."
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.900]   So get ready when you go to 15.4 on your iPhone or your iPad, I guess, if you use face
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.560]   ID on that.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.760]   You'll have to redo the face ID.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:30.920]   So that, I don't know, so that you can use it.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.520]   I haven't tried it yet.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.920]   I stopped wearing masks.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.960]   So I don't know.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.360]   SharePlay sessions can be initially initiated directly from supported apps in FaceTime.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   Siri has a new voice.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.640]   Have you tried the new voice yet?
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.400]   We played it a couple of weeks ago.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   I switched.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.400]   We'll see.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.640]   I was using American Voice 3.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640]   I'm now using --
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.280]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.320]   The non-gendered voice files.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320]   I'm Siri.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.280]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:09.840]   They actually said they got somebody from the LBGTQ community, plus community to record
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   that.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.240]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.720]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720]   How many use that?
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.480]   I don't want it to sound like anything, like a human.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.080]   So I think that that's a program.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.440]   Well, it sounds human, just it's another variant.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.280]   But my only qualm, always, is that I accidentally changed the voice of my Google Assistant a
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280]   couple of weeks ago.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.520]   Actually, when I was testing things out for a story based on exactly what we were talking
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:40.120]   about, and I'm like, "It was so freaky," and I'm like, "I should keep this new voice
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.880]   for a day just to prove that I'm not going to get freaked out by this."
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:49.720]   And it's like, it really was exactly like having -- my regular assistant has a week
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:56.440]   off of vacation, and the 10th agency sends someone else in, and it's like, "Oh, hi.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   I'm Andy.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.600]   I'm going to be -- I'm going to want to be woken up at 8.30 AM and remind me that I'm
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600]   sovieting something."
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.400]   And it just -- I was tensing up because I'm not used to talking to this voice.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:15.040]   They've also fixed the most -- in my opinion -- single most annoying thing about Siri.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.080]   If she doesn't have an internet connection and you ask her what time it is, she says,
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]   "Hold on.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   I'm thinking.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.000]   I can't -- I can't tell you right now."
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.800]   So they've actually -- this is a feature in iOS 15.4.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.960]   Siri can provide time and date information via offline, but only on an iPhone XS XR
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.760]   11 or newer.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.920]   So the older iPhones -- I'm sorry, Siri -- still doesn't know what time it is.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.960]   It's not like Siri could constantly be checking a clock every once in a while and just making
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.080]   sure she's accurate and then be able to come back and just tell it to your --
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.520]   >> It's just a thing.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:56.560]   If you're in the EU, you can now use the digital COVID certificates and your wallet as we have
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.800]   been doing in the United States.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   That's actually really nice.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.240]   I stopped carrying that dog ear vaccine card around with me.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.320]   And so far, I haven't had to show it at all.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.560]   Nobody even cares anymore.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.920]   But if I ever do, I'll have it in my Apple wallet, which is nice.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.240]   There are a bunch of other things.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:19.600]   The podcast app adds episode filters for seasons, unplayed, played, saved, or downloaded, like
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.160]   everybody else finally.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.240]   You can manage your iCloud custom email domains from settings, emergency SOS settings, a change
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.880]   to use call with hold.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.120]   MineWatch decided I had to take a terrible fall the other day.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:41.120]   And it's lucky I felt it because it was -- if I hadn't canceled it, what it called 911.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.640]   I think it was just the door closing behind me.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.560]   It was the slamming door.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.160]   So anyway, there's a bunch of other things.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:59.640]   Big update in iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, I presume also TVOS and WatchOS and all that will be
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.160]   updated as well.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.160]   Take a little break.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   We'll have more.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.640]   Mark Gurman is a very special guest.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.720]   Great to have him from Bloomberg's Power On newsletter, which you must subscribe to if you
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.600]   don't already.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.640]   At Mark Gurman -- were you just doing a hum so for us?
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   Was that your message?
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640]   No, I guess sort of.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   Yeah, you kind of were.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.800]   It's a wave to the audience, hi everyone.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.160]   Glad to be here with the crew.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.600]   He can do a hum so I could kill him.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.400]   It's so great to have you.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.400]   Nice to meet you again with Renee too.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.520]   Hey, you know what?
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.440]   Be my guest anytime you want to be on.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.840]   We will make sure you come on.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.400]   We would love having you on here.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   If you --
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.640]   Wait, when there's a big story coming up.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.280]   Let's please, let's do that.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.320]   It's really great to have Mark Gurman on.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.560]   Also Andy Inako from WGBH in Boston.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.920]   Of course, I was just looking at older shows you've been on more than 10 years now.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.800]   You've been part of Mac break weekly.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800]   When did you start?
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.960]   Do you remember?
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.880]   We started at C. So I don't know what --
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.320]   We started at C. Now, you might, when you're listening to the show, wonder what the hell
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.560]   is he talking about in a boat at C?
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560]   Yes.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.640]   We had a lot of international water so we could speak openly without apple pungeness.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.520]   One of those geek cruises, one of those --
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   What do they call them?
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520]   The Mac cruises?
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.520]   Yep, it was a -- Oh, God.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   Geek cruise.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.520]   Geek cruise, yeah.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520]   Mac mania.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.760]   Mac mania, that's what they call them.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.560]   Come combine Mac, Mac Unix and Star Trek cruises.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   Three very interesting cruises at the karaoke part.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.720]   So that's probably 2008, 2009, something like that.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.600]   And of course, the man who founded Mac break way back when --
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.880]   Hey, he's got a humsa.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.960]   He just drew an eyeball on his hand.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.200]   It's a good humsa.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   Nice job.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   It's horrible.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   So that's how --
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   I don't have a sharpie.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   That's how they calculated the staff of Ra.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   Exactly.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   Very nice.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   Sorry.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.760]   I just had to do it.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.120]   Way back in 2007, we did video versions.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:10.160]   In fact, we have them still on our site of Mac break hosted by Leo Laport, Kendra Aramoto,
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.200]   Emery Wells, who's now a billionaire, by the way.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.280]   Merlin Mann, Alex Lindsey, and lots of other people, including Sal Segoian.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.680]   And it was a lot of fun.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.840]   And then that -- I said, can we do an audio version?
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.440]   We'll call it Mac break weekly so people know the difference.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.000]   And the rest is history.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.520]   I think you've been with us since before the beginning, that means.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:38.480]   And of course, 090.media is where he goes to like five minutes a day, I don't know,
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   to do his job.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480]   His day job.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   There's work there.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480]   It's still 80 hours a week.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480]   I don't know.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.160]   On top of another 80 hours a week for office hours.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.760]   I only spend 30 hours a week on office hours.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.960]   But let's point out office hours is 24/7 now, right?
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.960]   It is.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   It is.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:57.960]   We did a -- you know, it's funny.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.680]   So we did today, we talked about ice-cast serving.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.680]   Which we use.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:01.680]   Love ice-cast.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   Not to build the ice-cast server.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.400]   So that was the second hour.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.240]   And then eventually what happens with us is they'll be in after hours, which is what
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.920]   runs 21 hours a day.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.680]   A session where we all build one together.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.040]   Like, let's build an ice-cast server together.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.680]   And we'll all get on AWS or whatever.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   Lin Node in --
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.760]   Can you just slow down because I'm already overwhelmed with the amount of content you
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   do.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.760]   And I can't keep up.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   And I just --
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.920]   It's just -- I got to say, it's just a lot of fun.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.880]   Like, it's, you know, I'm sure you have this kind of the same experience.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.480]   I get to hang out every morning with fabulous.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.160]   Like, some of the smartest people in the world.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.720]   Some real reason I do this show is --
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.720]   Yeah, for you guys.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:43.440]   Anyway, great to have all three of you more to come with our panel this week.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.240]   But first a word from our sponsor, Zokdok.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.240]   This is a very timely product.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.800]   A Zokdok.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.880]   Zokdok is a doctor that you can find in an app.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:03.400]   It's a free app that shows you doctors with their reviews, which, you know, doctors for
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400]   a long time kind of resisted that.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.640]   They take your insurance.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.960]   They're available when you need them.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   Zokdok.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   You got to know about this.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.320]   There's some amazing doctors out there.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.160]   Really, the only ones you care about, I care about, are the ones who will take your insurance.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.760]   But Zokdok, you can focus on doctors who are in network, putting you on the path to
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.840]   see a doc who's right for you.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.240]   No more wasting time.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.920]   Hunting down Aunt Shirley's cash only chiropractor.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.800]   For the dentist, your coworker recommended who it turns out to be out of your network
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.120]   and not accepting new patients anyway.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.640]   No one knows what you're looking for in a doctor better than you and no one's better
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.800]   at giving you the tools to find the perfect doctor.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.720]   Then Zokdok, D-O-C.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   D-O-C.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:46.400]   Folks who created Zokdok found all the major pain points in healthcare, all the things
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   that weren't working.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.080]   They said, "We can do better."
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.680]   They made booking a great doctor, surprisingly pain-free.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.240]   You know what, that's what you want with a doctor, is pain-free.

[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.200]   Because honestly, I want to know how patients feel about their doctor.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.560]   You see what other real humans have to say about their visits so that when you walk into
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.760]   the doctor's office, you're set up to see somebody in your network, takes your insurance
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:25.760]   who gets you patients like, I think it's about time we had ratings for doctors.

[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.720]   Just like that, you're booked.

[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.280]   traveling, if you're in a strange city.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:09.080]   Many available within 24 hours.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.520]   It's not emergency care, of course.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:17.520]   But if you need somebody fast, you can often get one.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/MacBreak.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520]   This is the case.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   We always wait until we need somebody fast.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   Like I broke my leg three weeks ago, but it's really starting to hurt now.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.320]   Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/MacBreak.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:32.160]   Thank you, Zokdok, for supporting MacBreak Weekly.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:37.760]   And thank you, MacBreak Weekly listeners and viewers, for supporting us by using that special
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.400]   address, sockdok.com/MacBreak.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   Are you going to get a Mac Studio?
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.400]   I'm not going to get a Mac Studio.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   I'm actually not going to get anything from this Apple.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   Really?
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:55.200]   I know it's a rarity for me, but yeah, I'll be -- I mean, I just got this MacBook Pro at
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.640]   the end of the year and I feel like if I were buying anything from this event, I'd just
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:04.400]   be basically throwing money away because there's absolutely nothing I need from it.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.400]   I think so.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   I really --
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.800]   It's funny because this doesn't usually happen.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:15.400]   The store went online before Tim Cook had left the stage on Tuesday.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   Really?
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   I missed that.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.040]   I know somebody said it in the chat room and I went, "Oh!"
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:27.680]   And I immediately went in and ordered a maxed out studio for review purposes and stuff.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.440]   And it's coming Friday.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.440]   Everything I ordered after that.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.960]   Yes, everything I ordered after that's coming two weeks, three weeks, four weeks.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.960]   What about the monitor?
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   Did you order the monitor?
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.640]   I didn't order it at the same time and I wish I had now.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.640]   When it's coming April?
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640]   I was torn.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.240]   Yeah, I was torn about the monitor.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.040]   Let me check.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.080]   If I thought about it, I would order it at the same time probably would also have been
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:51.760]   getting that in a timely fashion.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.720]   So the studio is coming, ordering progress.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.680]   The studio display, rather, is coming April 7th.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.360]   I ordered two maxed studios.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:06.840]   Ended up going back in and ordering one lower end one, the 2199 version that's coming March
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.360]   30th.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:15.880]   And then Lisa's fancy ultra $4,000 maxed studio is preparing a show.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.880]   That's for her.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:17.880]   Arriving Friday.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   Yep.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.320]   You know, are you married Mark?
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.680]   Not married, but I have a steady girl.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.680]   Steady girl.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.680]   A girl friend.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680]   Maybe she's watching.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.680]   Yeah, so a little tip.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.920]   A little advice, a little piece of advice.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.960]   Just get them the best.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.120]   I always try to.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:39.240]   She has a beautiful new necklace.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.120]   Ah, good man.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   Very happy.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   Good man.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.200]   Jewelry is always a winning, winning recipe I find.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.760]   Let's talk about this because if you raise a good point, I'm trying to think what new
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.680]   Apple products will I get this year?
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.600]   I know it sounds kind of nerdy, but this is the stuff I love.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.280]   I just love opening the new stuff.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.080]   I'm a total fanboy.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.680]   OK, the iPhone for sure.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   I'll probably get the big one.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.360]   You'll get the 14 when it comes out.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   What do you expect?
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.360]   It'll be new and exciting and different about the 14.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.240]   They'll make you want one so bad.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.120]   So it'll have this old make me want one so bad just because it's shiny, new and made
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120]   by Apple.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.160]   But in terms of what will be market, it's probably the satellite texting feature, which
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.000]   is a way to make the campaign.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.440]   Now, OK, so that was one of those rumors.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.320]   It's going to have satellite phone.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.440]   And then the conclusion I came to is that was dumped by somebody who owns one of these
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.680]   companies that just wanted the stock.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.560]   It was a pump and dump.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.920]   You think there actually is going to be a satellite capability in this phone?
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.840]   I think Apple's working on it.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.760]   And I have a whole team working on various different satellite initiatives.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.760]   So it's real.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.560]   Yeah, they started this team in 2017.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.400]   It's run by two guys who used to run Google's satellite internet division, a guy named Mike
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.360]   Trella, another guy named John Fennec, and they have a team of people working on stuff.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.200]   They've explored building their own satellites.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.960]   They explored using people's existing satellite infrastructure to beam internet to Apple devices.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:12.720]   The latest variation of their work is satellite based texting and SOS and the kind of like
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.800]   a spot tracker or something like that.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.120]   So if you're out of phone range, you can ask for help anyway.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.520]   Yeah, but it's not to make calls.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.080]   It's for short texts, like very short texts.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:29.080]   And if you're in a boat accident or a plane crash or not.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.640]   Now, the product codename is reportedly Stewie.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.400]   Do you have to talk like this to do it?
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.160]   You don't have to talk like this to it.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.160]   Oh, lip.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:38.760]   You actually sound just like it.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.800]   But what I've been trying to figure out for the last years since I first heard about this
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.800]   is what does the codename mean?
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.800]   What does that mean?
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.840]   What does Stewie have to do with the satellite?
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.280]   Does he look like a satellite dish?
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   Yes, he does.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   He's got a football head.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Okay.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.520]   So yeah, that's what I thought it was.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.680]   He looks like a satellite dish.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.080]   Okay, so that's why it's called Stewie.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:00.960]   But anyways, they've had this thing developed from a software standpoint, ready for months.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.720]   This thing is ready to go.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.240]   It's just about if they're going to have the correct hardware in this year's model or
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240]   next year's model.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.600]   It seems to be a very limited appeal feature.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.120]   But I guess, I mean, unless you think Apple wants to replace the cell phone, yeah, anything
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.520]   they can add, I guess you're right.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.920]   You know, it makes more sense to me for an Apple watch.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:19.920]   Yes.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.920]   Yes.
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.520]   So, but I think like those spot watches.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:23.920]   What's too small though?
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:25.920]   Exactly.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.920]   There was a rumor.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.160]   I don't know what you think about this that they would not in fact offer the newest processor
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.400]   in the regular iPhone 14.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.040]   You'd have to get a Pro Max to get the.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.040]   Yeah, that was from Quo.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.880]   And it makes a lot of a lot of sense to me.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:46.120]   I mean, it's no different than the fact that the MacBook Air will have an M2 and the MacBook
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   Pro will have a.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120]   And M1.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.720]   Except they've never done that with an iPhone.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.760]   They've always had a new generation.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.340]   They've always had a new generation in their Apple Silicon history and their own custom
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.600]   chip history.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.640]   So this will be the first time that they're not going to upgrade it.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.040]   I think this may have to do with the chip shortage.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.200]   In some respects, which would make sense.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.760]   Or given that they have that chip shortage qualifier right now, this is a good time as
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.240]   any to actually make that transition because the market is used to getting those new chips.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.680]   The A15 is also very speedy, very fast.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.640]   They just added the A15 to the iPhone SE right here.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.640]   Right.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.640]   And it's not that old.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.640]   So I don't know.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   It all adds up to me.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.640]   I think that's going to be true.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.120]   I haven't heard it personally, but it rings true to me in terms of their latest strategy.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.880]   No, no more iPhone mini.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.880]   I hear.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   Is that what you hear?
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.760]   iPhone mini is gone.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.040]   They decided like two years ago to stop making the iPhone mini because nobody was buying
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.840]   the iPhone 12 mini.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   Right.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.440]   They knew they weren't going to be able to do that.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.680]   They couldn't discontinue it in time to not include it for the iPhone 13 line because
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.000]   those plans were already in place.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.800]   It's kind of hard to just cancel phone the last minute, right?
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.320]   There won't be an iPhone 14 mini.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:05.520]   They're going to do is they're going to have two 6.1 inch models, two 6.7 inch models.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:12.000]   And I think that the iPhone 14 Macs, not the Pro Macs, the regular 14 Macs could just be
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.200]   one of the best all time selling iPhones ever, getting that bigger screen for that lower
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   price.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200]   I think it's going to be fantastic.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200]   Interesting.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.640]   I'll probably get some Pro Macs, but certainly being able to offer a 6.7 inch phone at that
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:31.680]   price point, probably at an 899 type price point or 799 price point, fairly compelling
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.520]   in my view.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.320]   And I think we're going to have those four, that style of four iPhones.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:45.000]   So big and a small, regular and Pro, and then eventually we'll get like an iPhone Ultra
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.160]   that sits on top of the entire lineup.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:52.200]   That does something neat and cool, whether that's a foldable or a different type of display
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.960]   or something, right?
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   Just like Samsung soon.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.280]   As you go ahead, go ahead.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.360]   What's your take on the camera resolution?
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.880]   On the new iPhones, I don't know.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.600]   I think I saw a rumor out there that it would be a 48 megapixel camera, but I'm not sure
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.320]   how that equates to resolution and such.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.440]   It's funny, Apple has been the company for years that used to say, "Oh, we don't talk
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440]   about specs.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440]   We don't care about speeds and feeds.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.640]   We don't talk about this or that because we let the products and their capabilities
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   speak for themselves."
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.360]   Well, this is now also the company that's been touting the M1 Ultra, that had a whole
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.200]   fan of processors.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.560]   They put the RAM on their website now for the iPad.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.960]   You're seeing a shift here, right?
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.960]   I mean, they have their opinions until it's no longer convenient for them.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:36.960]   Right?
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:37.960]   Right.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.560]   Now that getting into the speeds and feeds and the numbers game is convenient for them,
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.560]   their opinion has shifted.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.760]   Hey, that's how I work too.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.760]   I can understand that.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.760]   That's how any human being works.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.680]   You have your opinions until they don't work anymore.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.200]   Well, sometimes I'll sit back and be criticized a decision Apple has made or think I'm about
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.040]   to criticize a decision Apple has made.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.600]   Then I think about it, it's like, "What the hell would I be doing if that was my decision?
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.040]   I would be doing the same thing.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.000]   You got to do what's best for your company and best for yourself."
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.800]   You got to present, but you got to put your best foot forward.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800]   Let's see.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.800]   What else?
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.800]   Shenzhen lockdown.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:15.760]   Is that going to cause a COVID?
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.920]   Some concerns about supply increased supply chain problems in the fall.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.080]   So here's the interesting thing.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.440]   So that Shenzhen lockdown only runs through March 20th.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.800]   Now, as we all know, because we were here two years ago, original COVID, it was like,
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.280]   "Ah, we're going to shut down for a week.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   Shut down for two weeks.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.280]   We're going to do this.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.280]   We're going to do that for a few days."
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.280]   And then look what happened.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.360]   We've been through this for two years.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   So right now it's Shenzhen.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   Right now it's one week.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.120]   Apple has multiple iPhone factories in China.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.240]   This factory in Shenzhen is actually their smallest one, one of their smaller ones.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.360]   Oh, I thought that's where they were all made.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.840]   That's not the king of their factories.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:59.200]   They have a factory that people call iPhone City.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.400]   That's up and running.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:07.440]   The news is, is we're three to six months away from iPhone 14 mass production.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.440]   And who knows?
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.680]   I think we'll be okay.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:13.440]   I think this is going to go longer than March 20th, but I don't think this is going to hurt
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.520]   Apple in the short term or the long term.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.480]   What other Apple products are you going to be buying?
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.120]   M2 iPad Pro.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.640]   I want to see if I can get my iPad Pro.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.120]   Come on, the iPad Pro is already vastly overpowered.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.880]   You needed them to it?
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.280]   Listen, I don't have the M1 version, right?
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   Okay, that's different.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.520]   The Mac safe charging and I want the Ein and all that.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.800]   It's under both four maybe would be nice.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.440]   And so, you know, there is reason to get to it.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.360]   So you were when you used the iPad Pro as your main work machine, that was, you didn't
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.840]   feel constrained by that.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   You were able to.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.040]   I didn't feel constrained by it.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.840]   Now that I have a Mac Pro for comparison, though I do feel concerned.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.680]   I'm telling you, I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but like, I couldn't really use the Intel 16
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:04.000]   inch Mac Pro for work because I have tons of web snaps open and it wasn't very efficient.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.840]   You know, it's a, it was like a $3,000 paperweight.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:12.120]   I didn't, I just got the pro, the M1 Pro in a 14 inch, not a 16.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.760]   And it's the best laptop I've ever had.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.000]   It's mind boggling in every respect.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   It's great.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   They really do the great job.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.640]   It's changed, changed the game.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.680]   So, I mean, I know video editors use it and you know, they had a MacBook Air non M1 previously
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.760]   and they're like this M1 Pro 14 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.400]   You know, I can do what I took me eight hours and four.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.000]   So when does that get updated?
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.680]   Is that the fall?
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.840]   Which one the MacBook Pro's?
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:36.840]   Oh, I don't think they'll be updated.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.840]   That's until next year.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.080]   I think they'll be updated sometime next year.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.120]   Is there on a year and a half to two year cadence?
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.320]   Yes, that makes sense.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.120]   So if you have an M1 Pro or Macs, that's good.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.840]   You'll be all right for a year or two.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.600]   I wouldn't if you're looking, if you're in the market today to buy an M1 MacBook Pro.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.600]   Wouldn't hesitate.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.920]   Unless we're talking about the base 13 inch MacBook Pro, which will be refreshed soon.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.720]   That's going to be the M2 or M1 X, whatever.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.800]   They end up calling that.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.720]   That's that and the MacBook Air will be updated.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.080]   Will the M1 Mac mini be updated as well?
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.160]   So the Mac mini will become an M2 Mac mini.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:17.240]   I think that'll be either late this year or sometime next year.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.040]   So we'll start to see a kind of consistent cadence then.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.440]   We'll get there, right?
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.440]   Low and high and low and high.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.360]   They got the difficult ones done.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:30.040]   And going from M1 to M2 across the whole line, that's not the big deal.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.960]   The big deal was getting the first M1s out.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.680]   And so you'll see more regularly a regularity in the future.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.800]   There'll be an update to the 24 and July Mac as well.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.320]   It'll be M2 versions of the Mac studio.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.160]   So help Alex Lindsey out here.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.720]   Because he wants to know if you should buy some studios or should he wait for the Mac
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:50.720]   Pro?
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.400]   What are you predicting for the Mac Pro?
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.840]   Well, the Mac Pro will just essentially be double the performance of the Mac studio.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:02.920]   So the Mac studio, I believe, is the ultra Macs.
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.320]   The M1 Ultra Macs.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.480]   If they're waiting out the M2 line for the Mac Pro, I think it'll be the M2.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.480]   M2, extreme.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480]   Extreme.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480]   Extreme.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.480]   That's my guess.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.320]   As Renee would say, that's my guess.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.320]   Okay.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.320]   So, okay.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.240]   And I'm already bought an ultra.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.880]   I'm waiting.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.880]   I'm going to buy a Mac Pro.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:22.880]   I've got a smaller ultra.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.200]   I think I'll plan to get a Mac Pro.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.360]   Is this studio the small Mac Pro we were hearing rumors about?
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.720]   Or will there be a little cheese grater?
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.920]   Because I would love a little cheese grater.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.600]   Well, there's both.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.600]   It's both.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.600]   They'll be both.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   Right?
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.760]   Yeah, this is the small Mac Pro.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.320]   And then the new Mac Pro is smaller than the current Mac Pro.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.400]   My questions, interchangeability, modularity, what kind of parts are you going to be able
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.400]   to interchange?
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.400]   What are you going to be able to upgrade?
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.320]   There's a reason why you have a big case.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:56.320]   But we no longer support third party graphics cards, which are the primary reason you had
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.520]   that giant case.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:04.360]   But also adding and removing RAM, putting in more SSDs and hard drives and all that.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.640]   So what is really the differentiator between a Mac Studio and a Mac Pro?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.880]   Well, I believe it's going to be...
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   Expandability.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.880]   Expandability.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.440]   But the question is, what is the expandability?
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.520]   They would have to develop a whole new set of frameworks and technologies to make their
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.680]   custom silicon expandable.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:23.040]   But the question is, are they going to do that?
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.040]   That's right.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.720]   Or just do it over Thunderbolt 4, in which case it doesn't need to be in the case.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.720]   Right.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.720]   So I don't know.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.760]   But I don't see the purpose.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.800]   Unless the Mac Pro, their only selling point is that it's double the performance of the
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.000]   Mac Studio, which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   Right?
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.880]   It's interesting to see the lesson they learned from the trash can Mac, which they finally
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.560]   had to admit because the cooling system is just not adequate.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.400]   We cannot upgrade.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.160]   So it's clear the Mac Studio.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.680]   It's more than half cooling system.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.240]   Basically it's a cooling system.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.240]   It's a cooling system.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.440]   It's an A13 powered cooling system.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:08.840]   Did you know ahead of time there was going to be copper and aluminum or was that a surprise
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.640]   when that came out?
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.040]   So I knew there would be two thermal versions because of the power differences.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.600]   I didn't know that it would be a two pound difference.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   That's a big difference.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   That's a big difference.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:26.120]   So I didn't realize that it would be that much of a weight difference.
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.680]   And I think John Lueguesz kind of got it wrong.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.080]   And he said Monday note because he was speculating about the two pound difference, even though
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.240]   maybe he wrote his Monday note before he released it.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.840]   He released it a couple of days ago.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.200]   We knew by then that the difference, the two pound difference was because of the copper
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.360]   versus aluminum.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:52.480]   He had some other kind of wild speculation about that.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.480]   Okay.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480]   What other things?
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480]   Let's see.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   You're going to buy an apple car.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480]   We know that Mark.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:59.240]   That's as many years away.
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.320]   But the Apple Watch.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320]   Apple Watch.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:08.720]   Now that's another one where I didn't bother with the Series 7 because my Series 6 is fine.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.720]   Series 8 I would probably do.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.280]   I think I'm starting to get the point where I'll skip a year every year.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.720]   For the Apple Watch, they're making it pretty easy to start skipping a year if not two
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:17.720]   years.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.800]   I mean the Apple Watch Series 4, that was the big one and that was in 2018.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.200]   And so I got to imagine the Series 8 will be pretty impressive this year.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.360]   But the other hand, they're so far ahead, they're basically, people like to say, "Oh,
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.760]   Apple's in a league of its own."
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.800]   But they are literally in a league of their own.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.760]   I can't name another smart watchmaker at this point with any relevancy.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.080]   I mean you have Fitbit lighting on fire on people's arms at this point.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.000]   Yeah, that's not a good look.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:55.120]   Tim Cook perhaps speaking out of school at one point talked about blood sugar testing
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.920]   without non-invasive blood sugar testing with an Apple Watch and that has not materialized.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.560]   Is that coming?
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.560]   It seems to me that's something that's much harder to do than anybody thought.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.000]   They've actually been working on that since 2013, 2014.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.600]   Sure, because if they can do it, it's huge.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:16.680]   Yeah, if they've been working on it for a decade now, I don't see it happening for at
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.680]   least three to five more years.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.600]   So next will be body temperature, then blood pressure, then blood sugar.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.040]   Blood pressure would be good.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.160]   There's almost 40 million Americans who have diabetes.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:35.080]   So that's 40 million Americans who would immediately light up a watch if they didn't
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.080]   have to prick their skin.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.240]   Huge.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:45.080]   So that's obviously Apple and everybody else is saying, you know, that's the holy grail.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.160]   That's a big business if we can solve that one.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:55.120]   All right, let's see.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.920]   I think, boy, we've covered the rumor mill here.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:06.720]   We've got victories for Apple TV shows in its awards season.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.400]   Ted Lasso got a critics choice award.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.840]   Congratulations.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.200]   Ted Lasso is just rolling it up.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.560]   Best comedy lead actor Jason Sudeikis.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.960]   Let's see, there were the BAFTA's.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:29.080]   There were the SAG awards, but the big ones are, you know, for Apple is probably going
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:34.880]   to be the Oscars where Coda is nominated for a best picture.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:40.680]   It's interesting how the streamers now are so totally dominating in these awards.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.680]   They have more money.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.680]   Like they have all the money.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.200]   They're doing better stuff, frankly.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.360]   They're hiring all the talent.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.920]   Like that's the thing is it's just it's just that that's where all the money is right.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:55.080]   There's a limited set of people who can make Oscar quality filmed and Steven Spielberg
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.120]   notwithstanding, a lot of them are going to streaming.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:05.040]   Also I think one of the strengths that they have is that they don't have to boast about
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.720]   viewership numbers to advertisers or anybody else.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.400]   So they can simply they can they can run a show like Ted Lasso simply because they have
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.760]   data that says that there isn't the projected audience for this matches with our audience
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.520]   at Apple TV or we'd like to work with these people or this would, you know, some would
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.680]   be profitable for us.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:27.440]   So that means they're taking more risks so that they're not doing things like what was
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:30.960]   supposed to network show their their I saw ads for where it's basically setting up huge
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.440]   like domino stacks with explosions and flashing lights.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.440]   And it's like yeah, that's what the networks are down to.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.280]   They are down to dominoes.
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   Dominoes with like.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.840]   And it's like I mean they're playing it right.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.040]   Like colors flashing lights.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.200]   Well they're going low end right.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.680]   They're going after the main stream mark.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:56.560]   Well, here's the thing is they're going after what's interesting is is that a lot of the
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.120]   streamers are going after things that you would never spend money on in a broadcast
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.840]   environment and then they're throwing that money at it.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.760]   You know, like that because they can, you know, this is a matter of the uni subscription
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:11.000]   model is so much better than a retail model or even an advertising model.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.640]   It is it is a it's a much better model to make money, you know, and because so but but
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.720]   you do have to keep people wanting whatever is the next thing.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.360]   You know, and so I think that that's, you know, that's been the, you know, but like Netflix
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.400]   has to serve all these different audiences.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:32.760]   So like you have these their movies, which are fine, but they all you also have chef's
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:36.320]   table, which is a completely different like you would never put that on a broadcast,
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.320]   right?
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.040]   But it's like one of my favorite Netflix shows ever.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:44.680]   And so the so the but I think that the interesting thing there is that there's also a much lower
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.400]   threshold of what people think is good and what they think is okay.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:53.200]   If I spent a ticket to go to see Red Notice, I think that that was the Ryan Reynolds,
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.240]   you know, rock.
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.440]   If I had spent a ticket on that, I would have been really upset.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:51:59.840]   But on Netflix, I was like, it was okay.
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:00.840]   It's a popcorn.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.840]   We hang out.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:02.840]   It was fine.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.960]   You know, like I didn't I went with no very, very low expectations.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   I didn't have to pay anything for it.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.080]   I watched it at home.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:13.280]   So there's the entire model of making content is evolving where I can do something that
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:16.640]   people aren't going to they don't have to get out of they don't have they literally
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.320]   don't have to get out of bed to watch what you're making.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:26.200]   And so that's a very different kind of content play than getting people to go spend, you
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:31.500]   know, $100 for a family of four to go watch your movie, you know, and do you think Domino
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:35.840]   Masters is the cop rock of the 20th century, 21st century?
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.640]   At least they're singing a dancing in cop rock.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:43.120]   I'm not sure if I mean, there are there are better people on YouTube doing dominoes, you
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:48.840]   know, teams incorporate a sports night theme and custom elements into their rube Goldberg
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.520]   style topples in Domino Masters.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:53.520]   Wow.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:58.000]   I mean, the problem is now is that with a lot of broadcasters, I can just see that and maybe
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.040]   it's because I work in the industry, but I can just see the model like I can see that
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.560]   literally like they're going to do this.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:04.560]   Well, that's your there.
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:05.560]   You're expert.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.560]   And so it's a tired format.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.480]   And again, when you get rid of commercials, this is the other thing with streamers is that
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:18.040]   when you don't have commercials, you don't have to figure out how you build up act one
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:22.600]   to a point where everyone wants to go to act two and then give them a commercial break,
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   you know, or build up.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.880]   No, it's how you make the show exactly.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.400]   Because there's all these or even the whole series, you know, so for instance, when you're
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:36.240]   not like, you know, a Marvel I've I've decided is I'm going to give you six to eight episodes.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.280]   The first one's going to be amazing, then I'm going to save money on three and four and
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.280]   five.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.280]   And then and then I'm going to make sure you leave going.
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.280]   This was amazing.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.040]   You know, like, like, you know, it's all the money is spent on the two hums.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.440]   It's a different it's an entirely different model than what we've seen in the past.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:55.280]   By the way, just so, you know, get the popcorn ready because Netflix announced not one,
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.680]   but two sequels to Red Notice.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.680]   Right.
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:01.120]   It was the most viewed thing they've ever done.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.120]   It's horrible.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120]   It was so bad.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.960]   Why do you think this is what they did?
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.720]   This is classic Netflix.
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.600]   They just picked people like, you know, there's a lot of people.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:11.760]   That's why I watched it.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.960]   And Ryan Reynolds three people.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.240]   I was like, that's why I watched it.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.040]   I was like, I got exactly.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.760]   I was like, how, how bad can it be?
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   Pretty bad.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.760]   You know, and it's bad, but it was really fun.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.080]   It was good clean fun.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.080]   Good clean fun.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.080]   People.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.080]   How about Ben Stiller's severance severance?
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.080]   Have you been watching that on Apple TV?
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.640]   I have no time.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.240]   I've been watching it.
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.080]   I'm not sure yet.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:43.560]   It's a very sterile show because the premise is that people are so desperate for work.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.280]   They're willing to have to work in a top secret facility, but basically have their personality
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:54.840]   divided in two so that the person who's you have your day persona, which works.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.960]   And then your nighttime persona, which doesn't work and neither knows what the other one's
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:01.760]   doing, which is a creepy premise.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.040]   But a lot of it takes place in this super sterile basement facility.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.040]   Of course, it's very cheap to shoot.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:11.160]   I don't think anything that Apple does is cheap to shoot.
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:12.960]   Like, I don't think there's any money anywhere.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:15.560]   I still feel like Apple is struggling somehow.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.560]   And I don't know why.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.040]   But every time I watch something in Apple, Lisa says this too.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.920]   It's like, yeah, it doesn't.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.920]   It's not quite.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.520]   I think it's too much brussel sprouts.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.480]   Like, for me, there's too much brussel sprouts in Apple and stuff.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.440]   Lots of like lasso's a hit, right?
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.120]   No brussels or is there brussel sprouts in Ted Lasso?
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.120]   The sharp break comes big.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.120]   There's all these figures.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:35.120]   Yeah, I'm not a brussel sprouty.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   I know what you're saying.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.120]   It's all good for you.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.120]   It's good for you.
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:39.360]   And it's like all the Apple stuff is always good for me.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.640]   And I'm just like, sometimes I just want to watch a show and not be told what I should
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.640]   think.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.480]   And I'm just like, so I have to admit that I have not been a big fan of pretty much all
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:51.640]   of the Apple stuff except for Tiny Planet or whatever they call it.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.640]   Tiny love that show, I know.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.640]   I love that show.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.640]   It's great.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:00.920]   But so in the documentary, the ones with the producer, I can't think of his name right now,
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:09.160]   but there's a whole thing where they break down the beat machines and how music gets
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:10.160]   made.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.160]   Oh, the music documentary is great.
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   With Mark Ronson.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]   Ronson.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:17.960]   So those ones, I think, I'm really in the documentary.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:20.000]   I like those.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.960]   The fiction stuff that Apple's done, I've not watched more than, I think, a half an episode
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:25.960]   of anything.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.760]   Like I get halfway through it and I'm like, "Ehh."
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:28.760]   Actually.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:32.520]   It seems to me, Apple's model is the Red Notice model.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.360]   Nothing's terrible, but when you put together all the services, it's like you've got Dwayne
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.120]   Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds.
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:41.000]   It is, but it's all together.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.720]   It feels like they, I feel like there was some conversation internally that we're going
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:50.880]   to create a higher level of content that has more meaning and more meaningful and more
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.880]   whatever.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.920]   And when I'm watching passive TV, I want to be passive.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.560]   I have to admit that I don't need a higher order of things.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.040]   If I'm watching a fictional thing, I just want to watch porn identity.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:06.040]   Just, you know, it's...
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.960]   All right, let's wrap it up.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.040]   We're going to have our picks of the week coming up in just a bit.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.480]   Boy, it's been a pleasure having you, Mark Ronson, with us.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.480]   It's driving me.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:19.040]   I will invite you back and you can come on any time, as many times you want, but next
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:25.080]   time there's a story that you got a scoop on or whatever, we will bring you back.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:29.240]   Our picks of the week coming up in just a second.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.440]   Let's start, actually, let's start the pick of the week with our guest of the week, Mark
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.920]   German, Bloomberg's Mark German.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:38.720]   I think you've got a pretty good pick.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.240]   My pick is power on.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240]   Yes.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.240]   Yes.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:44.080]   I've got to do it.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.720]   Would love if anyone could would subscribe.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:48.360]   There is a free version as well.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.560]   And also, there is a subscriber version that comes as part of the larger Bloomberg subscription.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.720]   I would encourage you to sign up for payer-free.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:02.640]   What I like to do is I like to give some scoops or hot takes every Sunday, every Sunday morning.
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.880]   Then there's definitely a lot of links to other articles that we've written, more perspectives
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:08.880]   on things.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:13.120]   There's always some juicy information about Apple and Peloton and Amazon, whatever.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.840]   Triggled throughout the newsletter.
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:17.560]   There's a Q&A section as well.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.240]   The newsletter has been a lot of fun so far.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:20.760]   The subscribers are going quickly.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.400]   I would encourage anyone to be part of power on.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:25.960]   And there's a lot more to come.
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:32.400]   It was a very good move for Bloomberg to see this as a way to monetize you.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.480]   By the way, right now, special deal, $0.99 a month.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:41.120]   Unlimited digital access on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg app.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.480]   That's a great deal.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.320]   Considerable reduction.
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:47.800]   Now that's only for the first year, but hey, take it.
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.800]   Take it.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:49.800]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.800]   Appreciate it.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.800]   Thank you for being here, Mark.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.800]   We were really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really appreciate it.
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.800]   You're great.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:55.800]   Thank you.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.960]   Andy, an echo pick of the week.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:03.400]   My pick of the week is more of a tip and tip slash pick of the week is your state consumer
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.400]   laws.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.120]   They, consumer protection laws, they bear inspection for your individual state.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:14.280]   And I'll tell you why I was reading a thread on Reddit about this person who was having
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.640]   problems with an M1 MacBook Air.
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:23.040]   That was just one of those things where you just get a bum device and just keeps breaking
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.840]   and they keep trying to fix it.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   And it breaks again.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.360]   They fix it again and they breaks again and then it's out of warranty and they won't
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.920]   fix it anymore.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.480]   But he lives in the state of Maine.
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:39.240]   So he stated the Maine has a really powerful implied warranty law that says that I'm reading
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:42.480]   it directly from the office of the Maine Attorney General website.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:46.440]   The Maine implied warranty is a little known law that protects Maine consumers for being
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.640]   sold seriously defective items.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:52.960]   It can be an unfair trade practice and they've capitalized unfair trade practice because
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:57.560]   it's a legal definition to refuse to honor the Maine implied warranty law within four
[01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:59.480]   years of sale.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:03.600]   The basic test for possible implied warranty violations is as follows.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:09.720]   So if A, the item is seriously defective, truly if this laptop is not working, yeah, that's
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:10.720]   seriously defective.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:15.120]   Two, if the consumer did not damage the item, so as long as it wasn't dunked in paint or
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.120]   something.
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:20.800]   Three, the item is still within its useful life and is not simply worn out.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:25.000]   And laptops are supposed to last, are supposed to last four years or more.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000]   No problem there.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.520]   So he cited, he finally got down to brass techs, cited the Maine implied warranty law
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.440]   and like the manager of the Apple store or wherever said, yeah, okay, that's fine.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440]   We're good.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.440]   We'll fix it.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:43.920]   So this, and since then I've been looking around about this stuff and yeah, it's, it's
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.720]   very, very likely that if you cite this law, either the manager of whatever store it is
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.780]   that sold you this thing is gonna challenge you on it or are gonna have to look it up.
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:58.480]   In which case you're gonna have to educate them or someone else has, has put on the one
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.240]   true ring turned invisible.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:02.240]   And they're real.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:03.240]   Okay.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:05.600]   At this point, it's a lot easier for us to before they get the state attorney general's
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.040]   office involved in your, because remember that the state attorney general's office is
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:12.920]   also very, very happy to help you enforce those laws.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.040]   So just you write a letter that basically freezes that the, that the freezes the countdown of
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.720]   four years so that even if it's like six years, but you've been trying to get them to do this
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.520]   for the past three years, it's still, you're still can get this repaired for free.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:31.600]   The implied warranty laws in your state might be able to let you get something fixed, even
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.720]   if it's an Apple laptop.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.200]   If it is again, a seriously defective product that should still be working and you didn't
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.480]   abuse it in any way, it's better than just simply staying home grumping and writing a
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.440]   blog post about that nobody's going to read.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:44.440]   Great.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:48.160]   If you're in Maine, I, I, somebody ought to do an article on whether other states have
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.680]   these laws because that is a really good tool.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:51.680]   I'm looking into it.
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:56.440]   Apparently there are 10, according to a law blog that hopefully enumerated that there
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:01.120]   are 10 states that have laws that are as powerful as this, but did not mention what they were.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:06.720]   Massachusetts, for instance, has a law that is a lot more, a lot of states have implied
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.080]   warranty laws.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:13.840]   But they're complicated enough that it's easy to weasel out of them if you follow, whereas
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.640]   Maine's is very, very simple and also they're very, very consistent on enforcement of it.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.440]   So it is a very good card to keep in your wallet, so to speak.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:28.280]   Whereas in other states, you might have a law that will help you, but essentially winning
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.720]   with this blunt instrument might be a long slog.
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:35.960]   But it's again, once you're at the point where this, the, the seller or the store or
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:40.080]   the manufacturer is definitely not going to fix your defective product for you.
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:41.080]   You've got nothing to lose.
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:46.360]   You may as well at least force them to hire one and a half hours worth of legal advice
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:49.800]   before they tell you to go, to go take your ball and go home again.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:56.000]   By the way, it's a secondary recommendation for slash R slash Apple, the Apple subreddit.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.640]   There's some very good subreddits.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.800]   That's a good, that's another good one.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.720]   There are a lot of really great consumers.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.880]   My favorite, I'll keep this short, but one of my favorite stories about Massachusetts
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.880]   consumer laws was somebody who was actually used to work for the consumer, the consumer
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.200]   affairs office in Massachusetts, got fired when a new governor decided to downsize that
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.720]   entire office, but he knew what the laws were.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:19.160]   So when a circuit city, I think it was, had, had one of their flyers.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:21.480]   Oh, everything in the store is on sale.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.680]   Nothing held back.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.500]   He, he went into the pocket calculator, filled up his cart with like thousands of dollars
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.480]   worth of stuff, paid for, paid for all of it with his credit card, and then pocket the
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.680]   receipt is like to speak to the manager.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.880]   I'm sorry, the, the flyer said everything is on sale.
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.480]   And if it's not, it's free.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:42.640]   And apparently whoever wrote that ad for the national ad did not realize that Massachusetts
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:46.760]   has a law that says that you cannot claim that something is on sale unless the discount
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.840]   is more than 3.5%.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:52.200]   So they had to, they had to refund him every single one.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:57.400]   They hit like cameras, TVs, a pile of stuff, and they just simply had to give it all for
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.640]   free because none of that stuff was on sale.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:04.360]   So it's, it's like what it is like, it's like being the one kid who's playing like monopoly
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.640]   or life or a board game who has taken the time to read the inside of the box lid.
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.400]   You know, the, ooh, I'm, I'm entitled to get 300 dollars to lid it directly.
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:13.400]   You that kid.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:14.400]   I bet you were.
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.480]   My friend, my friend was that kid and I learned from that kid.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.160]   I always read the box top.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.160]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:23.280]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:26.400]   So I, you know, I went a little more expensive than normal.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.640]   Oh, so I have a, I have a mic.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.840]   So, you know, so I have a mic.
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.280]   So while I'm talking, oh, yeah, going down.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.280]   And so it's a mic mute.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:37.320]   It also has a, it's a,
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.200]   We call it a cloth button in the radio biz.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.640]   Yeah, this one's a little more complex.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.480]   So this is what's called a studio technologies model 205.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:46.480]   Oh, I need to do.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:49.640]   So this is, yeah, this is over Dante.
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:52.560]   So you now have power power over ethernet.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.880]   So you literally have an ethernet cable going into it.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.160]   You can select a lot of different routing that's inside.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:58.800]   So it's got a little control panel that you can,
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:04:59.640]   that you can run with it.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.400]   It also has two talkback buttons.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:05.000]   So if you're connected to a comms device, or if you,
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.680]   I have it running through Dante to a comp, so Unity comms.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.400]   If I push down my, my comp,
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.920]   you couldn't hear me down there because I,
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:17.320]   cause my, when I pushed my comms down, it automatically turns.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.800]   It was, but whoever saw the other end of the comms say,
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.160]   can you get me a cup of coffee?
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:22.880]   Cause I'm dying. Exactly.
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.800]   So I can do it off mic and everything else.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.120]   And I've got two comms channels that I can work with that.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.960]   Again, it is, I can go straight into it or I can process Dante.
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:34.480]   And it's a, it's a really powerful tool.
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.360]   It's a little more than a cough, cough button,
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:37.480]   which I own, I own cough, but.
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.920]   So wait a minute, John says I can do that too, women.
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:43.400]   So if I press this button, but the, the,
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:46.520]   and what are you using for that?
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.240]   Nothing. I don't think we use this at all,
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:51.080]   but we have a very fancy, thanks to our axia system.
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:53.000]   We have the axia system modules.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.920]   Oh yeah, we got it all off. Talkback, mute.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.760]   I got different program buttons.
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.200]   I got a dial and the, and all that stuff. Yeah.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:02.520]   Actually, if you're, if you're working in an axia system,
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:03.560]   that's a great control panel.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.560]   This just works with anything.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:07.240]   Yeah. Because you just done it. Right.
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:08.760]   Yeah, which is pretty much everything.
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.720]   I mean, you can let you can get a Dante virtual sound card on your
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:13.360]   unfortunately, actually it is Max Dante.
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:16.320]   So we can't, but if I were building a studio today,
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:19.480]   actually I love, we love the axia system and Telos gave it to us,
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:20.880]   which was very generous of them.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.840]   Yeah. It's a great. Thank you Kirk Harnack.
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:25.960]   That will be ever, ever, and you'll be in my memoirs Kirk.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:28.400]   Thank forever grateful.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.400]   But yeah, if we were going to build a studio today and we didn't have
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:34.880]   a good friends that tell us, that would absolutely be most,
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:38.440]   most pipeline, most audio pipelines for most events, radio,
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:39.760]   axia is very popular.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:43.840]   Most general purpose is Dante, you know, is, is how, is how things
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:45.960]   are passed around. And so, so it's a really, you know,
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:48.000]   it's one of those things I finally decided I should work
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.840]   because I use it literally all day, every day.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:53.360]   Anytime I'm not talking in a meeting, I, all I have to do is tap
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.840]   a little button and it's, you know, I'm off and I, and I can.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.640]   Carlita, can you get the kids to shut up?
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:07:00.160]   Do you, do you provide your wife with a comm system?
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.160]   You should.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.160]   Yeah, I don't think you appreciate that.
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:04.160]   Where that will go.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:09.280]   You know, I think that would go across the, the, the, the ultimate
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:13.000]   laws of marriage, which is a happy wife is a happy life.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.720]   And we just, we just stay away from that one.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:17.880]   Model 205 announces console from studio.
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:20.200]   And there's knowledge. How much?
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.200]   It's like a hundred bucks.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.520]   So it's, it's not, but it's, there's a bigger ones too.
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:27.200]   It's just a, what's nice about this one is it fits on my desk.
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:30.200]   So it sits underneath my, you know, my eight, 10 extreme or whatever.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.320]   And so I, so I have it.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:33.960]   It just, it's just a nice little, um, actually,
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:37.760]   Lisa needs a, a cough button for home.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:38.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:41.760]   Maybe we don't have a comm system though, but maybe I can get one.
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.200]   Because sometimes she'll be doing a lot of podcasts in her office at home.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:51.080]   And, and instead of having her go screaming down the hall, the zone just broke.
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:51.840]   God.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:55.520]   She could just do it on the comm system and I can have a little earpiece.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.160]   Always be ready.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:58.240]   That's a good idea.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:07:59.840]   That's a good idea.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.960]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey, oh nine, oh, dot media.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:06.480]   If you want to hire Alex to do your next event, streaming event.
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:08.120]   And of course, office hours.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:11.440]   Global is a fantastic place to hang out when you're not watching Mac break.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:12.800]   Weekly.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:13.480]   We have a launch.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.200]   We have a launch this week, Leo.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:16.160]   We're launching a rocket.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:17.000]   What?
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.400]   We're launching a rocket.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.560]   Is it an SD's rocket or a real rocket?
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.760]   It's a lot more.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:27.520]   So it's not, it's not a, it's not a, like a Tesla or a SpaceX level rocket, but it's not an
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.560]   S this rocket either.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.120]   So this is a fiberglass rocket.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.280]   It's like 10 feet high.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:32.120]   Oh my God.
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:34.720]   And no, no, it gets better.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:35.280]   It gets better.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:37.040]   It's not just that it's being launched.
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.560]   It is being launched on Saturday at nine.
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:42.520]   We'll put out somebody you can follow me on Twitter, whatever, but it's, there's,
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:44.760]   I think if you do space, oh, H or whatever, but it's the,
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.160]   it's the space crew, the space group.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.040]   There's like 40 people working on the broadcast.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:50.360]   So, so there's a, from then they're coming.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.640]   They're all like descending on little outside of Las Vegas again.
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.360]   One of our members, John Prado is the one that's doing the, doing the launch.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.880]   And so he's just doing a launch.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:08:59.640]   A couple of people started talking.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.960]   This is what happens in office hours.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:03.560]   A couple of people started talking about it going, oh, that sounds really cool.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:06.080]   And someone said, I could do the graphics and someone else said, I can do the broadcast.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.640]   I'll do the, can I be Walter Cronkite?
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.440]   We're standing on hold right now.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:13.240]   I'm sure we can include you in the car in the broadcast.
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:17.080]   The, but we have, we literally have one of the other members.
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.840]   She just got her medical, medical degree, and she's getting ready to be part of a Mars
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.360]   mission in the future.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.920]   And, and so she really knows a lot about space.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.160]   And so she's our space.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:30.320]   She's, she's one of our, you know, she's going to be doing commentary and talking
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.280]   about some of the stuff and, and she's out.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.200]   She's coming in all Australia.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:36.200]   So the other thing is, is there's this global, you know, the graphics are being
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.120]   produced, I think in, I think it's, I think, I think TOMO is in Finland.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.920]   And, sorry, TOMO, if I get the, those, all those countries in there, my head doesn't
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:45.640]   don't separate well.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.640]   So, so the, but they're all coming together to talk about it.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.640]   And so anyway, it's this, we're going to start the broadcast at eight o'clock on
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:54.440]   Saturday morning.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.240]   And, and then it will go and I'll post it on Twitter or whatever, but it'll go live.
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:03.840]   It, I mean, should launch depending on we literally have to get FFA approval.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:06.320]   Like this is not like a little, little rocket.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.760]   And they're taking trajectory out of the rockets to push back into the graphics.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.480]   We think that there's a, there's a chance that our graphics will actually be better
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.440]   than space.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.440]   I want to see.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.000]   Yes.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.520]   I want to see the, so you're going to have a camera on the rocket that you could see.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.360]   I think you're doing a camera on the rocket, but they're doing telemetry from the rocket
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.960]   the whole way up and that telemetry is being driven back to live graphics.
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:29.920]   So it's a, what is this going to be?
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.560]   The Saturday, the Saturday.
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:37.280]   Yeah, we'll start the broadcast at eight and then we'll, we'll at nine o'clock.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.640]   We'll, we'll, that's when we'll.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.640]   Like that candle.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.440]   We'll have a lot of fun.
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:41.960]   Yeah.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.280]   It's going to be, it's going to be a global.
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.880]   It's going to be spectacular.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.160]   Hopefully spectacularly good, but it will be spectacular either way.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.360]   It blows up all the more fun.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.400]   Exactly.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:52.920]   Exactly.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.320]   Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:02.040]   12, 13 afternoon this Friday, just go to WGBH news.org to stream it live or later.
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:02.600]   Nice.
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:05.760]   And Mark, or go to the Boston Public Library because I'm going to be in the,
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.000]   we're doing it in the studios that we just reopened.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.840]   So I'm going to, you can buy a cup of coffee and watch me stumble through notes
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:15.040]   visibly while audibly I seem to know what I'm talking about.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:16.520]   So we're calling all of this from memory.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:24.800]   And of course, everybody should go to Bloomberg.com/subscriptions/power on to get
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.000]   Mark's great newsletter.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.400]   Thank you all three of you.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:29.240]   Really great show.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.080]   Really appreciate it.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:34.280]   Great to have the insight into what's coming up next.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.160]   We do back break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1900 UTC.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.360]   Sorry, 1800 UTC now.
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.520]   All you have to do is tune in live.twit.tv.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.080]   There's audio or video streams.
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.120]   If you're watching live chat live at IRC.twit.tv or if you're a club, Twit
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:57.080]   member, by the way, we do have video of the rocket going up here on club Twit.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.880]   If you're a club, Twit member, you can.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.560]   Thank you Patrick.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.720]   You can join us in the discord dedicated club Twit.
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:07.960]   Lots of good stuff going on in there.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.760]   We've got some events coming up this week.
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.040]   Patrick Delahanty, who is a behind the scenes guy, does all the engineering Thursday,
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.080]   9 a.m. He'll be doing an inside Twit.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.000]   The book club was Stacy.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:24.000]   Corey Doctor has unauthorized bread is coming up on the 24th on the 31st Paul
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.720]   Therot with a fireside chat.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.680]   We also have shows in there that we don't publish publicly.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:33.920]   Things like the Gizfiz, the Untitled Linux show.
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:35.680]   We also develop shows there.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.640]   Club Twit is a way that we can do a lot more with a limited amount of money.
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:44.680]   In fact, you even get ad free versions of the shows because you're seven bucks
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:47.960]   a month means we don't have to play ads for you.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:51.080]   So if you'd like to join, if you don't want to add, you want to be in the discord,
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:56.840]   you want to hear the Twit Plus feed with all the special content, just go to Twit.tv/club
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.360]   Twit, seven bucks a month.
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.640]   I think it's a good deal.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.160]   A couple of coffees and you too could be riding that rocket ship to the moon.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:12.960]   Please kids, don't try this at home.
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:18.880]   After the fact on demand versions of the show available at the website Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:21.000]   There's a dedicated YouTube channel as well.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.560]   You can catch it there or subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.880]   Probably that's the best way to get it.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:27.320]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.200]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.440]   You just, whenever you're in the mood,
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:30.760]   you can listen to Mac break weekly.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:36.200]   And if your podcast player has a review section, please leave us a five star review.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:40.880]   That would really help the longest running Mac show in the world.
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.960]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:42.720]   We'll see you next time.
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.880]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:47.880]   The world is changing rapidly.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.560]   So rapidly, in fact, that it's hard to keep up.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:55.120]   That's why Mike Asargent and I, Jason Howell, talk with the people making and breaking
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.160]   the tech news on Tech News Weekly every Thursday.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.440]   They know these stories better than anyone.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:03.560]   So why not get them to talk about it in their own words?
