[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.000]   Lori Gill is here.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.920]   Thank you, Lori Gill, for being here managing editor at i'mware.com.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.680]   Appleholic. She's closed all her tabs.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.120]   She's ready to rock.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.640]   I still have a bad feed though.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.920]   No, no, you're better.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.400]   You're better.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.160]   Also, you could see next to me in studio with us.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   We've been very fortunate last few months.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.760]   Alex Lindsey's here from the Pixel Core at Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.320]   And today, I'm going to say to my right, Mr. Andy,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.520]   and not co from the beautiful WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.800]   Hello.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.600]   Hello.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.080]   And Renee Ritchie, who's of course our overachieving video guy.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.640]   Fancy cameras, fancy lights, fancy everything.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.720]   Hi, Renee from i'mware.com/vector.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   I'm like, I'm like baby Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.240]   Nita, Taney.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   No, no, I think you're starting to outpace Alex.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.440]   I think you're rapping.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   You're rapping in my wildest dreams.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.520]   So we start the show today as we will start every show this week
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.120]   with news from the Oscars.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   No, this is...
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.720]   But you got to...
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.640]   By the way, is this episode 700?
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.000]   Am I seeing that correctly?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.040]   Congratulations.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.840]   Yay.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   Woo.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.280]   700 episodes of this show.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.160]   Thanks really to this guy right here.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.720]   Alex Lindsey started Macbreak 700 some shows ago.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.480]   It was eight years old.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.560]   It would have never gotten as far if it was me.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.320]   So I'm glad you guys took it over and ran with it.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.000]   Tyka...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.360]   Did a better job.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.160]   YTT.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.760]   We saw it all on the Oscars.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.720]   Remember this?
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.920]   Right after Tycho YTT wins an Oscar for best screenplay for JoJo Rabbit.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   He goes backstage, gives a press conference in which he announces...
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.040]   He's looking.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   He's got the world in his fingertips, the most bully of all pulpits.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.160]   What does he say?
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.480]   They ask him, "What would you like the Writers Guild of America to fight for?"
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   He says, "You got to tell Apple."
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   Those keyboards suck.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.120]   Finally, somebody's telling the truth at the Oscars.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.840]   It says he's joking.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   That sounds pretty serious.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   No, he's not joking.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.600]   You're talking about a speech.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.040]   A speech on that in a way.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.320]   This one is computer.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.800]   This one is computer.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.520]   It would have been great though if he did it like he did it in the Avengers,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.560]   where he's doing the Querg Wars.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.360]   He goes, "For, for, Apple's not making good keyboards anymore.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480]   For, can you have a talk with them?"
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.640]   And then Thor puts on the headset and talks to Tim Cook and says,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.240]   "Listen, you make good keyboards.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.160]   We're all going to be over there and I'll shove this hammer."
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.120]   Okay, and Tim would still say, "We believe this is the best compromise between..."
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   We saw customers love this keyboard.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.720]   I think it was the one useful thing that was said during the August.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.440]   That's a huge...
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.080]   Yeah, the Oscars were horrible, but this is a huge black eye for Apple.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   And Apple, by the way, which is opening offices in Culver City,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.800]   along with some of these other streamers, because they want to be in Hollywood,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.360]   they had to be cringing on this.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.800]   And yet, is there anybody who's willing to say that Tyka YTT was wrong?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.440]   I mean, he could get a better keyboard.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.680]   But you also want to point out how much dominance Apple has when he
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.880]   had to find one person over on the side that doesn't use a Mac,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.480]   right? Everything that they do.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   If there's a silver lining, he's not willing to move to Lenovo ThinkPad,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.600]   which has a better keyboard.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.880]   He wants to use a Mac.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.600]   He didn't say, "I have moved over to a PC."
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   No, that's the bigger problem that he would have said.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.120]   I love Dell keyboards.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   That would have been a way better way.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.720]   We're right.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.440]   We're all impressed.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.360]   You're going to look at the silver lining there.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.880]   I just can't imagine what it must have been like for those entertainment journalists
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   to hear that.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.640]   They're cringing.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.480]   We're supposed to be talking about movies right now.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.200]   They're cringing.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.000]   They're like, "What's going on?"
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.200]   They're probably nodding their head because they're writing their articles on a Mac,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   talking to screenwriters who all write everything on a Mac.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   So they're all the same in the world.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.880]   This is a dead spin.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.920]   I also feel bad for the engineers at Apple who work on that keyboard,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   because they're doing the best they can.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.840]   I've complained as loudly as anybody else about it,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.720]   but I understand that this is somebody, some teams,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.120]   like this is what they do all day long.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.160]   And just when they start to get some positive reviews over the latest generation of their
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.560]   really bad idea for a keyboard,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.800]   now again, this is all over the news because he didn't even see it as a quick
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.200]   quip.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.360]   And then let's talk about serious issues about the WGA negotiating for more rights
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   and more respectability with studios.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.200]   It's like, "No, I am on this.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.520]   I thought I was just going to stop after one line,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.200]   but I've tapped into a deep-seated well of pain here.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.680]   And you've got thousands of people nodding and saying, "Yes, I why?"
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.760]   "I love you. I'm buying your t-shirt. I'm subscribing to your seminar."
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.080]   So I have to, you don't like to be called out on a project you work really hard on.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.040]   You're doing your best on.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.440]   And you got to take your t-
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.520]   Honestly, Andy, you're taking an empathy way too far on this one.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.120]   I don't feel bad for the engineers.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.400]   This is a problem.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.360]   It couldn't be anywhere.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.840]   Oh, no.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.560]   Presumably Apple is going to make the next, all of the next laptops have.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.160]   Because do we agree that the new 16-inch keyboard at least is usable?
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   Nobody asked him about that.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.280]   If you're listening to what TT, what do you think of the new one?
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.760]   Have you?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   Yes, question.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   You can afford to get the new one.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.320]   It's way too big a computer for him.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.840]   No, but it's way too big a computer for him.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.440]   Or a normal average writer.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.160]   He wants an air.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.400]   Yeah, an air or even a 13-inch.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.200]   I mean, I don't think many people who are just writing want to carry a 16-inch laptop.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.160]   Will the new air?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.680]   Well, what do you think?
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.480]   When they all have the new keyboard?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.760]   I'm really hoping because they hedged.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.240]   Like they were hedging a lot about how butter,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.800]   they weren't a band.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.160]   And I don't know if that's just face-saving.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.000]   Hedging about how butterfly still has its place and it's still important.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.480]   But this is, I think, a more pro.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.080]   Because there's no such thing as a more pro key.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.760]   People write on smaller laptops.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   Those are pro laptops too.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.360]   So my hope is that magic keyboard, all the things as fast as possible.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.240]   And if they were holding any desire to keep the butterfly keyboard around,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   even for ultra thin new computers that they're working on,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   I just hope they abandon all those plans.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   I don't even know how you could write a whole script on the butterfly keyboard.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.160]   I can't write a ton on it.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.880]   I evidently did.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.240]   But I've fine-fuelled the pain.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.440]   I don't think that other people hate it.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.200]   If in the last act, your main character becomes an absolute psychopath
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.040]   and wants to kill everything in the world,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.320]   I think that would be an asset.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.200]   But otherwise...
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.320]   No, but I've written like two million words on those butterfly keyboards
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.600]   and they don't bother me at all.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.880]   But it is, like I said before, if other people don't like them,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.080]   if a large percentage of other people,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.200]   there's no other manufacturer you can go to for a Mac laptop.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.800]   So that is a complete deal breaker.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.320]   You have to have a keyboard that maybe not every single person loves it,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.480]   but nobody has any problem with it whatsoever.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.600]   I've had one.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.560]   I got it right when it came out, the 12 inch or whatever.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.520]   And I could write notes on it and stuff like that.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   But I immediately was just like it became an extra laptop really quickly
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.760]   because it was just so...
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.200]   It drove me so crazy.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.760]   Well, many of us ended up bringing, dragging our 2015 MacBooks.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.360]   I still have this.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.960]   And now I'm going to get the 2016...
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.480]   I just feel vindicated because Andy and I have been bitching about this keyboard for me.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.400]   Like a year, two years.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.840]   And finally, here's an Oscar winner actually taking the time in his press conference
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.520]   where he's being congratulated for getting best original screenplay.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.240]   And that's what he...
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.680]   Some people talked about the climate.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.520]   Some people talked about Trump.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.360]   He took on an important subject here and talked about keyboards.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.640]   Apparently, he might have helped me.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.080]   I learned out the rule.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.600]   We're artificially in 718 cows.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.640]   Was Tim Cook there?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.920]   Like he was with Ricky Gervais?
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.120]   I know. That would be scary.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.720]   Poor Tim had to sit through Ricky Gervais.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.120]   I saw Jeff Bezos in the Oscar audience.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.280]   I don't think Apple was nominated for anything.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.080]   So there was no reason...
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.360]   Did you already said to Bezos that he thought the marriage story was fiction or something?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.000]   That was like that.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.360]   Well, at least he used his time in his Oscar speech on a problem
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   that's actually capable of being solved.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.560]   Something we can do something.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.120]   You don't have to be a real cynic to think that we will never be able to figure out
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.000]   how to build a decent keyboard for a MacBook.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   Whereas, again, global warming.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.280]   Good luck, great grandkids.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.840]   Sorry about the mess, but you're going to have to deal with it.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.120]   I don't know if Martin's comment.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.120]   He didn't want to say anything bad about Amazon
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.880]   because he still wants to get his packages on phone.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.680]   That was the best line in the whole thing.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.120]   Steve is a down-to-earth guy.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.160]   He really means it.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240]   Why is anyone not hosting the Oscars?
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.040]   Oh, because of Twitter.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.520]   Which is true, I think.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yes.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.400]   Actually.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.360]   That is true.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.320]   In fact, you could see the influence of Twitter and just the social media world
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.160]   on the Oscars because it was...
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   What's Eminem doing there?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.360]   It's like they're trying desperately to stay relevant.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.960]   And it was...
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.400]   Like your dad is programming the event?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's like your dad is programming it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.960]   And I'm your dad.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.200]   So he's even my dad.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.640]   It's somebody even older than me.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.320]   Rene, can I say that you've got some gray hairs there too?
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.640]   You're not entitled to say that Eminem is one of those old foggy musical acts.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.280]   Okay.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.480]   No, but I recognize that I'm all like kids today.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.920]   They would have had TikTok stars up there if they were really hip.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.360]   I mean, it's not that I didn't enjoy Eminem's performance.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.640]   It just was a non-sequitur.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.440]   It was completely...
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   I was confused.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.040]   It was like, what?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.280]   Is that Eminem?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.320]   What is he...
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.120]   Why are we doing this?
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.040]   What was this nominated again?
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.600]   What happened?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.200]   All right, enough Oscar talk.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.480]   Although I have to say, okay, I'm going to stay off topic again
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.160]   because we're running a little late today because we just watched Samsung launch
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.080]   two new phones.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.120]   It's Galaxy Buds at the annual Unpacked event 2020.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.560]   One phone looks just like an iPhone as Samsung phones have forever and ever.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.040]   That's the S20 and there's three of them, but they're going after the iPhone with it.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   They focused on photography and in particular focused on videography,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   which is where the iPhone has had an upper hand even over the Google pixels
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.640]   forever.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.720]   Renee, your colleague actually has an S20 and did a review of video
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.680]   from both the iPhone and the S20.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.960]   What was his conclusion?
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.400]   Yeah, I mean, we talked about it a lot.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.960]   There was a few takeaways that I was really thought was interesting.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   One is they've got a very iPhone pixel style camera bump,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.880]   which is like a bit of a regression because I always thought Samsung had
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.760]   nicer looking cameras on the back than most other vendors,
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.240]   but there's just so much gear you want to pack in there now
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.040]   that that seems to be where everybody is packing it.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.720]   And they're going up, they're taking a play out of Huawei's playbook.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.640]   And that is off the record, they're recognizing that they just don't have
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.760]   the same sort of machine learning prowess or the same silicon prowess that Apple or Google has.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.600]   So they're putting massive 108 megapixel sensor in there and they're pixel binning it,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.360]   which means that you combine the pixels to try to get an image that's better than
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   the pixels by themselves would produce.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.840]   They took Google super zoom and they've got to like 10 times,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.480]   a hundred times with digital zoom and they do this one shot where you're just at something
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   and you fly. It looks like you're flying all the way backwards and that kind of stuff,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   that and the macro stuff they're doing on the on the light cameras is just super interesting to me.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.640]   It feels like the next stage of computational photography.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   The video stuff I was less I'm more concerned about because they spent a lot of time saying
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.760]   8k 8k and I've seen so much bad 4k that would have loved to hear them talk about,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.160]   you know, we're doing enhanced dynamic range, we're doing full high dynamic range,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.240]   we've got an image signal processor that can just trowounce all these frames coming in
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   and really make sure you get consistent color and consistent all these things.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.840]   And they didn't say one word about the quality of the pixels just kept hammering
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.680]   the quantity of the pixels.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.200]   Well, and they said and you can share it with another Samsung phone user,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.480]   but as far as I can tell Samsung does not make an 8k screen.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.240]   They make an 8k television, they said you could beam it to your television.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.160]   But that's an expensive television.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.120]   Nobody owns it.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.440]   8k is apparently like 5g.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.360]   It's just another number and letter.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.520]   It's nice to like knowledge.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.600]   I would like it to the prop and to pan and zoom within.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.920]   Like 4k, a lot of people use 4k to make really, really good 1080p
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.400]   and you can make really good 4k out of 1080.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.320]   I'm saying down sample the 8k.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.240]   Down sample it or crop in like you could use it to do fake zooms, fake pans.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.840]   But again, I don't know the bit rate.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   I don't know the quality of that 8k and that's the part that I'd be really interested in.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.680]   Because you have a lot of cameras, like real cameras that shoot really bad 4k.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.280]   The number itself is meaningless.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.680]   Right.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.520]   Although I have to say I had to laugh when I saw Forbes headline.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.040]   iPhone 12 beats Galaxy S20.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.600]   It's like, "Ewan, what are you talking about?"
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.040]   We've not talked about local hosts.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.160]   I've watched them at local hosts, fortunately.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.000]   Holy cow.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.120]   Go ahead.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.040]   No, I agree with Renee that the quality of the pixels are what we have to really look at.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.520]   And how much detail we're getting, what's being made up,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.200]   like what pixels are true pixels versus what pixels are being created.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.760]   What a camera.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.880]   That is an amazing camera.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.600]   And how sharp it's going to be.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.320]   And then again, exactly the bandwidth is going to be a big issue.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.240]   Where if you're 8k at 20 megs a second, it's still not that much.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.640]   It's going to be very...
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.840]   Well, go back to that pixelated.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.120]   ...stay on that pixelated.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.160]   Now am I saying the ultra wide is 12 megapixels.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.000]   The wide angle is 108 megapixels.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   The telephoto is 48 megapixels.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.440]   That's all pixel binning though.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.160]   None of that.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.680]   The only one that's native is 12.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.440]   You can get the 108 if you really want it.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.560]   You can get it off the thing.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.680]   But mostly it bins down to 12, I believe.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.800]   12 and 16.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.440]   Although interestingly, because they were talking about 9x,
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.240]   and they mentioned 108, which is coincidentally 9 times 12.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.560]   So I think really they're 9x binning.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.920]   Yes.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.280]   Exactly that.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.680]   And the zoom that they showed was very fuzzy and soft.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.320]   It's optical.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.720]   It's not.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.080]   Yeah, I'd like that.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   See, that's why for me, every time that Samsung has a product release,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.680]   they have a bad track record of really wanting to make sure that they have a number that they can
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.200]   put on a slide that looks big or feature that looks that demos well,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.480]   that two or three weeks after you've bought it,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.680]   you stop using it because it just doesn't work all that great.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.240]   They were very, very early to have face recognition,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.960]   but it was bad.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   You couldn't use it.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.680]   They were very, very early to have.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.080]   They had features for keeping track of your pulse.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.280]   It was really hard to use.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.560]   You didn't want to use it.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.240]   The list goes on and on and on and on.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.800]   So I haven't obviously haven't tried it yet.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.160]   They have a good reputation with cameras, but every time I see it's always for me,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.400]   that would be that's interesting if it's true.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.520]   Let's find out if it's true.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.840]   Those phones won't be out for a while.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.800]   March 6th is the delivery date on those.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.560]   What will be available, and I guess I'm going to have to go to a Best Buy at midnight
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.880]   Thursday, Friday, because I don't think just the way looking at how they're doing,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   the pre-orders on this Z Flip, it looks like they're going to have very few of them.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.080]   This, I think, is an interesting phone.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   The first folding screen, there's two ways you can go with a folding screen.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.880]   One is to fold it out so it looks its iPad size.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.120]   The other is to have it start at a bill fold size and open it up so it's a normal phone.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   One's a folding tablet, one's a folding phone.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.720]   Yeah, this is a folded up phone that opens up to a 6.7 inch phone.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.960]   I think actually that's very compelling, especially since it's using a new feature of Android,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.840]   that lets the top half of the screen have a different contents than the bottom half.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.880]   You almost get a mini little laptop kind of...
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.080]   I wonder if they're hard to make and that's why the availability is a little sketchy for it.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.440]   That's the issue, yeah.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.640]   So I'm going to try to get one of these for the weekend.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.520]   I think it... Look, I'm just happy to see somebody do something different.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.720]   Yeah, exactly. And there's so much potential in these folding screens across all devices,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:56.320]   even just the idea of having a 17 inch screen laptop that I can simply fold and then carry
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.400]   in pretty much any bag that I want, even if I have to carry another Bluetooth keyboard with me.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.240]   That is fascinating to me. And a form factor like this new Samsung phone,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:13.120]   it's fascinating. As a market, we really, really want these large screen phones for content,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.400]   but the phones themselves are getting ridiculously large.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.880]   And just like you said, Leo, it's kind of frustrating that every time that you see
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:27.600]   a device design come out and you don't see anything that evolves from that,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:34.240]   you don't want to conclude that, "Oh, well, the idea of a flat panel of glass with no buttons on it,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.440]   that's phone perfection. We have perfected the user interface. We have perfected the relationship
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.960]   between humans and mobile technology. We don't have to do anything else on that."
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.400]   So when you have a device like this, where it's not only a small pocketable device that turns
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:55.360]   into a large phone, but having something that stands on your desk or on your table while you're
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.520]   enjoying your copy, and you have a picture that you're showing right now,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.040]   just to see the idea of you have a permanent chat window, but the flat part is all the controls
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.400]   that you want to be hitting with your fingers anyway. That is a wonderful idea. So I'm not
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.240]   going to be first in line to buy anything with a folding screen before, let's say, 2022.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.680]   But I'm glad that there are people who are excited about this to be, shall we say, early
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.520]   believers and by largely untested, unfealed tested devices, because it's going to be a while
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.760]   before we solve all these problems to make them durable. But I'm glad that Samsung is trying this,
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.640]   and they're the, as the kings of manufacturing, as the kings of, we will build everything and then
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.120]   continue to sell the thing that sells. They're the exactly the company that should be doing this.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.840]   I would caution though, like if I love these, I think humans just want to fold everything.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.320]   It's the history of our technology. We fold wallets, we fold books, we fold tacos. We just want to
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.840]   fold things. It makes total sense. We don't fold fitted sheets though. We try. We try.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.880]   That's the sad. So I would, if you really want one of these phones, let people like Leo,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.280]   people like Nairav, who buys all, let them buy them, use them for a month, make sure that they're
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.040]   really, because everyone loved the Motorola, it fell apart, everyone loved the Galaxy Fold,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   didn't do it. We're going to get there, just make sure someone else proves that we're there
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.840]   before you spend your money. This is also not inexpensive, $1,400.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:29.200]   The flip? Yeah, and it's the same, it's a hundred bucks less than the razor flip.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   The razor, they had a disclaimer bumps and fall and what I think was funny.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.560]   The screen came off the hinge, right? When you folded it. Yeah, that's normal.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   They're red, everything. There is a disclaimer with the Z flip that what is it, what do they
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   say? Because it's so small, I can't read it, but something like... Minor creasing.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.280]   Minor creasing, yeah. So that makes me nervous. They're not doing what the Fold and the razor do,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.240]   which is they do have a glass panel over it. Remember, that was the problem with the Fold,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.720]   is everybody took the plastic screen protector off and it broke immediately. So this time,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.520]   it's a glass, probably the flexible glass cover on top of it.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.680]   But what Motorola did was they let the cover, like they had a thing inside that bulged out the
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   screen when you folded it down to prevent the crease and looks like Samsung is doing the gap
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.520]   on the... You can see a visible gap again, so it doesn't look like they're doing much of that.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.400]   It doesn't look like a chunky build fold either. It looks like what you would expect to be carrying
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:32.240]   in your pocket as a phone, let's say nine or ten years ago. Yeah, it does a lot of early adopters
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.160]   that will get a lot of mileage out of it showing its friends being the cool kid at dinner.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.920]   Party. So I think just $1400 for some people, that'll be worth it. But otherwise...
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.640]   It's also taking a page from Apple's playbook because it's a fashion device. In fact, they even
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.760]   said there's a special Tom Brown edition which will be demonstrated tomorrow at New York Fashion Week.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.840]   And they had a lot of... It felt like the people showing the S20 were normal people and then the
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.440]   people showing the Z Flip world models. That's really the market.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.400]   Early adopter... There's a lot of people out there.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   I was joking that in five years there'll be a Moto bezel BZL that will just be like a retro
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.040]   fall in the front head and chin. The thing you love the most, the bezel. It'll be like the hipster
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.080]   bell bottom phone. And of course, Microsoft at the end of the year is going to do a dual screen
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.440]   book-like, couple of book-like devices that duo in the Flex, one Android, one Windows. That'll
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.280]   be an interesting product. Clearly, everybody seems to think that there's a market for this.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.720]   And there are separate screens. Not like one separate, so there's no crease or anything.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.480]   But with the high level of interactability between...
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.920]   It's not just let's build two phones and put a hinge between them. There's a relationship between
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.880]   those two screens that let you move things from one screen to another to spread things between
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:00.800]   two screens. They just released a developer kit, including a emulation layer that kind of really
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   shows off what you could... All the different modes that they have dictated and described for this.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.760]   And it's an interesting time. This has always been something that just feels like it should work.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.560]   And we just need somebody to try to make it. And I think that it's just not just the screen
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.160]   technology. But I'm just so glad that companies like Microsoft and Google are saying, we know that
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.680]   the technology is not here yet. But we are going to at least create a spec so that if a developer
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:35.040]   wants to create mobile double screen experiences, here is everything that it's all being supported.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.800]   Here's everything you can do with it. It's an opportunity when you don't have one company making
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.720]   all the hardware. I know it's something that Apple can't... There's no point in Apple doing it
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.280]   because they wouldn't be able to make the hardware as well. But this is why it's kind of...
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.160]   This is why when Apple finally discovers that thank you Motorola, thank you Samsung,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.560]   thank you Microsoft for the five years of really terrible hardware for just the people who are
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   super excited about this until the manufacturing figures out how to make these things, the engineering
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.880]   and how to make these things durable, and the software to figure out how an interface should work.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.720]   Now we're going to jump in and we're going to basically clean up the market because we're going
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.600]   to have the first one that really, really works out of the box. They don't mention... There's also a big
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.560]   battery life on it and I have a feeling with it. It'll be two cells right? One in the top one.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.080]   Yeah, it's not going to be very... It must be so good they didn't want to brag about it.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.560]   That's the only reason why. The other thing though that's important to remember with these
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   marketing things though is that Samsung essentially has nation state level funding. They have an unlimited
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.360]   supply of money and they make money making everything from toilets to oil rigs to everything.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   And the amount of money they make from phones is really insignificant. It's not like they can
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.240]   lose money on every phone but they could lose money on every phone where Apple has so much invested
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.320]   in the iPhone. They just can't experiment. They financially cannot experiment to the extent
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.400]   that conglomerates. So you wouldn't expect a folding phone from Apple anytime soon?
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.680]   I expect they have a ton of prototypes that don't think they'll launch it until all these
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   these early gen problems are solved. If ever. I remember doing it with the iPhone 4.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.200]   They already had a folding product for the iPhone 4 but yeah they thought it wasn't workable.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.960]   Go ahead, Loni. If this was running iOS, I would buy one right now.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.520]   Yeah, it's cute is it? It looks good. It looks fun. It definitely is like I could imagine this
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.680]   this version of a folding phone the type that folds down into a square. That's the design of
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.720]   the future. I could see that happening. I think you know it hearkens back to our love of the flip
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   phone of so long ago but also has like new technology involved in it. So it's it's the best of both
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.680]   worlds. And I think young people are going to be really excited about it. I see that design going
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.520]   somewhere for sure. By the way, no Samsung device now has a headphone jack. That's it. It's over.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   It changes so fast. We all have courage now, baby. Well the headphone jack is like the camera bump.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.640]   You have to have that first phone that has it and see if the entire world rebels against it.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.680]   And if the entire world doesn't rebels against it. Suddenly, your engineering department says that
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.760]   you know how we've been compromising our cameras because we absolutely was absolutely
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.680]   anathema to have a camera bump. Guess what? Cars open boys, bars open girls, we're going to be able
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   to bump out things and start creating 48 megapixel cameras with flashes built in.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.680]   And another bar cross line crust. None of the Samsung phones they showed today are less than
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:33.200]   a thousand bucks. Now Samsung has other less many other less expensive models. But so they don't
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.160]   have to worry. Apple has less expensive models too. And the light ones too, right? Those just came
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:48.240]   out. It feels like Apple might have decided they maybe went too far on the price point and they've
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.960]   kind of dialed it down a little bit. But not Samsung. I think it'll be interesting to see.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.560]   I think that Apple could go both directions where they make less expensive phones and more
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:02.080]   expensive phones than what they have right now. But the US is 5G only and that's a tax on top of
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.000]   every phone that you buy. And if you don't have 5G in your area. That's just nuts because
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.760]   most areas don't. And even the areas that do the 5G is unimpressive.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.640]   You know, it doesn't make that much of a difference. It's not going to be a thing for another two or
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.040]   three years if then. I think it's going to be a marketing thing until proved otherwise.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:27.760]   Like I said, 8K 5G. Well, they have the line of 3G. I guess anything with a number in a letter
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.840]   you should assume. Because independent testing agencies have proven that 8 is a larger number
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.680]   than 5. They were trying to make the case for it and they couldn't. Like the guy looked so bored,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.440]   but he was basically talking about 5G as if no one had ever had an internet connection before.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.120]   Yeah. Like they'll be able to upload a video. Like nobody could ever upload a video. And they
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   don't have compelling. It's the same as Verizon Superbowl ads. They don't have any idea what
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.920]   the use cases are going to be yet. Right. All right. Let's take a little break. Then we have
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:01.200]   some actual Apple news. I promise you. But first a word from FreshBooks. Our sponsor, FreshBooks,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.120]   is an amazing thing for anybody who's a small business or freelancer. You know that the end of
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.720]   the month when you have to put those invoices together are always though, you know, at least they
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.360]   were for me the worst time of the month. I hate doing that. But if you don't send invoices,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.720]   you don't get paid. When I found FreshBooks, and this is some time ago, it changed my life.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.920]   Let FreshBooks change your life. They make it easy to stay in the black without seeing
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.480]   red. And that's not just another ad sales pitch. It's a genuinely easy to use
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.280]   invoicing, expensing, books, managing tool. It does all your accounting for you
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.440]   without actually doing any accounting. At least you don't feel like you are.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.960]   24 million people now have used FreshBooks. 4 and a half out of five stars on GetApp.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.680]   Small business owners really love it because it lets you focus on the thing you love doing,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.200]   the thing you started the business to do, and spend less time invoicing and expensing,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.360]   tracking your hours. They've saved users almost 200 hours a year on average. Create client profiles,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.800]   enable automation for recurring invoices. I love that feature. You can watch as FreshBooks
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.760]   automatically combines expenses, billable time and other items into invoices to send
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.280]   to clients on your behalf. You don't even have to do anything on your part.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.680]   Whatever you do, or business, whether you're a freelance photographer or a carpenter,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.120]   if you're a podcaster, choose the FreshBooks plan that's right for you. Use their accounting
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.840]   and reporting tools to file your taxes. Evaluate your financials. They help to find the money to
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.320]   hire new employees. I never knew when I was making money or not until tax time rolled around. Now
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:42.000]   you'll know all the time exactly where you stand because simply by doing invoices, importing expenses,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.720]   keeping track of invoices received, you're doing the bookkeeping. But it does all the
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.600]   fiddly bits so you don't have to worry about it. By the way, it doesn't just send invoices.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.800]   You can also stop chasing after the money when the clients don't send you the money.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.560]   Enable online payments. That makes it easier for them to pay. Credit cards in ACHUS only.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:10.800]   On average, FreshBooks users get paid twice as fast because it turns out clients don't like
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.320]   paying bills anymore than you like sending them. If you make it easy to pay them, they just say,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.520]   "Ah, pay them. Just get it out of my hair." You'll get notifications when clients open your invoices
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.200]   so there's no more, "Ah, I didn't get it. Send it again." FreshBooks will automatically send
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:32.000]   gentle or not so gentle, late payment reminders and bill late fees. They just make it easy to do.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.920]   It really takes the pain out of invoicing, out of bookkeeping. It's just a simple intuitive tool
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.560]   for any small business owner. Of course, if you ever have a question, you want a little help,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.360]   they've got the best award-winning support team based right there at the FreshBooks headquarters

[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.880]   I really appreciated this too because I had to do it in Canadian dollars. I was billing Rogers.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.040]   They do every currency and the conversions are automatic. You don't even think about that.

[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:44.720]   We didn't have ads for the first 400 episodes. What is the anniversary gift for 700? Is it dirt?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.080]   Because we're oldest dirt. We're oldest dirt. It's unobtainium.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:57.200]   That's a pretty good number. We do roughly 50 a year. In only six years from now, we'll get to
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.960]   do a thousand. We'll have our thousand show. You'll be hosting it at that point. I love the
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:10.880]   Gotta get 200. It's amazing. I got about five more years. You got it in seven. You got it in
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.560]   six. You got it in six. You got it in six. You got it in six. I think I get to get to 1000. I think I
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.360]   get to Twitter 1000. I think you get to make it. Steve Gibson's already said he only has room for
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:24.640]   three digits, so he's not going past $9.99. Why two cable? He's going to go eight. Let's get to
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:32.320]   chat room. Figure out for me. If we continue to do 52, because we do the holidays and everything,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:39.680]   if we continue to do 52 a year, what date will the thousandth episode be? 300 episodes from now.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   Yeah, six years, a little less. He goes, look at the cruise right after that. I'm out of here now,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.040]   man. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.880]   We're right at the very end. So there we're going to end that year. I was saying for a while that
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.800]   there was there's this round the world cruise. I want to take January 2025. But if I have to go
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:06.480]   to 2026, break time is over. Cruise time is starting. The long there's they just sailed on the law.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.840]   Viking has the world's longest round the world cruise. I think you're gone eight months, something
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.400]   like that. Wow. And of course, the coronavirus, you may never come home. You could be gone for
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.240]   you. Nobody's stuck in a port forever. Nobody's going on cruises anymore. You realize that, right?
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.320]   Oh my gosh. Because it could be a NWC anymore. Yeah. Because you can't get off it.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   By the way, that's going to be a big deal. I wonder if this becomes the death knell
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.800]   for conferences. Mobile World Congress, Sony says we're not going.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.600]   Number of press conferences have been canceled. LG is not going. I think people are very nervous.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.560]   And and you don't need to get together and meet space anymore to announce a product. Look what
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   Samsung just did to to tell people everything you're doing. They they they did this before
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.800]   mobile world Congress. They don't need to go to mobile. We've definitely been. I mean, a lot of
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.840]   the shows that I worked on, there's definitely a trend of smaller shows with more broadcast,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.760]   you know, and so, you know, there is a power to have everybody there. It's good for me.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.840]   It's good for me. Yeah. So it's got to do the broadcast. Yeah. But it's it is. But that's where
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.360]   we and also breaking those events up. So you have six events around the world, but they're not
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.560]   you're not trying to bring people in from all over the world. You're bringing the Northeast to
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.600]   New York and the West Coast to San Francisco and you're not trying to have everybody. It hasn't made
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.000]   sense for a long time. It's just the event. Folks can't figure out how to do it. Currently,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.280]   we're waiting for GSMA, which puts on the mobile world Congress to decide, but they said by the
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   end of the week, they may cancel it, which is crazy. Although that report got disputed,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   and then they would then they no commented it hard. So it's it's I think they want to leave that
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.480]   open, but they don't want to tell people, Hey, we're thinking about it. I don't even know how
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.240]   a scam is that because if I if I understand if I understand correctly, well, not only that,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.960]   it's the way they do the hotels. Yeah, a big part of their revenue is the hotels. They buy up the
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.440]   show. It's all the hotels, all the hotel rooms, and then they resell them at a huge
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.560]   profit. And so but they're still they still stuck with the hotel. That could be tens of millions
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.880]   of dollars. It could be business ending for them. Yeah, there has to be less legal liability to
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   putting on a mobile world Congress that nobody attends that canceling. I'm not I'm not kidding.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.840]   It's like I have it's I have seen this play out before where you wonder, wow,
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.280]   why do they even bother doing this? And the reason why is because they were
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.840]   well, they were way too deep into commitment before they realized this is not a viable thing to do.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.440]   AT&T is announced. It's pulling out Intel just announced they're pulling out media,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:39.040]   Texas go sprint have all pulled out of video. It is not looking good. Right. You know,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.240]   you know what a bullet we dodged? Lori Gill, you and I were a C. Yes, I was
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.680]   thinking about I'm walking around C. Yes. And at the time I was noticing,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.560]   why there are a lot of Chinese companies here. There are a lot of Chinese people.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:57.280]   I thought that's great. It's really shows how interdependent we all are. Head a few of them
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.080]   been carrying coronavirus and coronavirus started in October and November. It could have easily happened.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.400]   That could have been a disaster zone. Well, it'll be interesting to see how between the
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.960]   Apple or the America or US China trade issues, then combined with coronavirus, you have a lot of
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:19.360]   suppliers have to be thinking about we shouldn't have our entire pipeline in one country. And so I
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.080]   think that we could see, you know, factories popping up in other parts of the world to start to
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:30.480]   diversify risk. So Foxconn was going to reopen yesterday. Their biggest plants, one, has been banned
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.400]   from reopening by the government. They're not making masks. The second is 10%
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   stepped and you sound like you're joking, but they are in fact, making masks. The Foxconn
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:46.240]   you know, it's interesting. I'm not sure why people are so concerned about coronavirus. There
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.760]   haven't been that many cases in the mortality rate hasn't been as bad as some other illness.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.440]   Well, they don't know because they can't accumulate the data. They don't have the test. They don't
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.040]   have the data. They nobody actually knows what the real numbers are. They're telling people to just go
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.080]   home. It's an abundance of caution as opposed rather than taking a chance. The fatality rate is
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   much higher than the flu. It is higher. Like 100 times. Okay.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.480]   Also on Chinese social media, they're even on Chinese social media people are
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.600]   openly suspicious of the numbers that the government is providing the people about spread of the
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.800]   virus, what's happening. And the Chinese government is trying to deeply, deeply contain this by
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.160]   really stomping down all rumors. Sometimes it is rumors, but this is not a government that
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.520]   is averse to playing with effects if it's a problematic fact.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:41.200]   So it's abundance of caution rather than information.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.760]   Well, so a lot of people have died. 700 something like that. 1000. Okay. That's in China.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   Yeah, there'll be 30 or 40,000 in the US alone that will die of flu this year.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.040]   But it's not that it's much higher number. The flu is more dangerous, but is very small
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.960]   percentage. And maybe coronavirus doesn't spread as easily. Well, the other issue is that the
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.600]   coronavirus theoretically, if you can get ahead of it, doesn't become a seasonal virus. The flu
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.160]   is not something we can stop from happening. The coronavirus is still in a position where it's
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.600]   not big. It's still small, but it's only one coronavirus. Like there's SARS as a coronavirus,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.320]   and there's a whole bunch of other. Well, the flu is able to contain some.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.200]   Influences as a coronavirus. And this one is like a new strain and they haven't really...
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.640]   They don't know what's going to happen. It's going to mutate. Yeah, they understand.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.200]   Yeah. And I think if the Chinese government didn't overreact the way it is right now,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.040]   there'd be a lot of people around the world who were accusing them of not reacting enough.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:43.360]   So the overabundance of precaution, I think, is better for everyone because it's safer. And if
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.480]   they just kind of pretended like it wasn't that bad, but then it did end up getting that bad,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.800]   that would look bad. Ming Chiquo, who of course is an analyst and writes analyst notes for
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   his investor clients, said that... We talked a little bit about the consequences of this.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:13.920]   Foxconn plant's closing. He says that the Jung-Jo plant, which is the most critical
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:20.640]   iPhone production site focused on iPhone 11, SE2 and iPhone 9, was scheduled to resume work
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:27.760]   February 2nd. It's been delayed and I think delayed again. In Shenzhen, they make the next generation
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.000]   phones, the 2020 phones. He says the development team did not stop work for the Chinese New Year
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.520]   holiday. This must be the small phone, the successor to the SE, that's supposed to come out in March,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.920]   right? The rest of the plant was scheduled to come back on February 10th, but that has also been
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:52.000]   postponed. That was yesterday. Pegatron's Shanghai plant, also making iPhone 11s in the new 2020
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   phone resumed work February 3rd in Shanghai. And their Cushan plant is scheduled to resume
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   work on February 10th, but that's been delayed. So basically, all he says is there are still many
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.120]   uncertainties, but I think you could expect that you're going to see shortages of a lot of these
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.440]   products. And there's so many Apple people who go there every day and haven't been going in weeks
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.000]   and they're usually there to oversee all of the ramp-ups in the various design and testing phases.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.320]   Even when they reopen, there's going to be a delay getting back to work. Even unpredictability,
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.800]   just as a thing can be as corrosive to business as an actual thing itself.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.360]   Well, we'll just have to keep watching this and stay safe, wash your hands, don't touch your face,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.440]   wear a mask, whatever else you need to do. Don't go with bats or snakes.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.280]   Don't, yeah, I was reading something that said part of the reason this is a problem is because bats
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:50.400]   have an incredibly aggressive immune system. Their heart because up to a thousand beats.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.760]   They're really good at fighting infections. So anything that survives in a bat.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.800]   Right. Bad news.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:01.280]   Bad news. Apple has added universal, you're gonna have to explain this to me, Renee. What does this
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:09.440]   mean? Universal purchases for iOS, TVOS and macOS apps. This is part of Xcode 11.4. The beta just
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:15.840]   came out. So when Apple introduced the iPad, they introduced the concept of universal binaries.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.320]   And that meant that you could have an iPhone interface and an iPad interface in the same app.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.840]   So you bought that app and if developers chose, they could make them separate. But if they chose
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.920]   to make one app, you download it on your iPhone, it would run the iPhone app, you download the same
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:34.080]   binary on your iPad, you would run the iPad app. When TVOS came out, they introduced the idea of
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.720]   bundles. It wasn't the exact same app. It was a different binary. But developers could choose to
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.760]   make an app bundle. And that meant that if you bought the iPhone or iPad version, the iOS version,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.040]   it would unlock the Apple TV version or vice versa for you. So you bought it on one store
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.520]   and it unlocked it on the other store for you. And now they're extending that to the Mac.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.200]   It's not just catalyst apps either. It's any app on the app store. It does have a lot of caveats
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:04.720]   on the developer side. But for customers, it just means that if I buy, I don't want to throw Greg
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.680]   on a bus here, but if I buy drafts on iOS and he chooses to support it, I'll go to the Mac App
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.480]   Store, look for drafts. And instead of seeing buy now, I'll just see download now because that
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.960]   got unlocked. That's a good example though, because Greg makes drafts for Mac OS, iOS,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.320]   watch OS. I don't think there's a TV version yet.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   Don't have to me. Oh, it's like James Thompson would already have that.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.640]   But already have the TV version done. But so,
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   it's up to the developer to say, okay, I'm going to make this universal or not.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.600]   The purchase. And there's two big caveats there. One is that they would technically have to bundle
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.360]   the app ID and that would just shred the existing app. If they have an existing app,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   that would destroy the history, everything pertaining to that original app. And they'd
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.000]   be starting over with essentially the same app, but a new version of the same app.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.760]   And a lot of people love their reviews and love the history of the app and all those things.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.880]   But also, you're once again asking a developer to take less money for additional work. And it's
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   fine if you think the Mac version is worth $40 and you get all of them together. But if you only
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.720]   use an iPhone and suddenly your calculator app is $40 because you also get a Mac App you're
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.040]   never going to use, then they start thinking about subscriptions. So it's going to be a lot of
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   things for a lot of developers to weigh. Yeah, I can see that. And so this doesn't make it
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.840]   easier to make a universal app. This just makes it easier to sell a universal. Yeah,
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.800]   to give it away for free if you buy the other part in Apple. If you make a catalyst app
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:38.480]   with 13 for in mind, it will be defaulted on the universal purchase. Can I guess that makes
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.680]   sense? Because catalyst is just a technology for making an iOS app run on Mac. They'll have
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:50.800]   the same bundle identifier and so forth. It's fine as long as they don't force developers to
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.840]   make choices that they think are not in the best interest for their users. Right.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:44:00.080]   And it punishes the early adopters of course a little bit because they've already put out
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.760]   their catalyst apps and now they have to consider whether they're going to obliterate them and make
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.200]   the new bundled app. Well, those users have been punished enough.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:20.160]   Colonel extensions. Always a bad idea. They deprecated those some time ago.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:28.560]   Release of Mac OS Catalina introduced an alternative, something called System Extensions.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:36.640]   And with a release of 10.15.4, it'll be goodbye Colonel Extensions. Hello, System
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.920]   Extensions. Again, to Renee Richie to tell us what the hell the difference is.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.560]   Yeah, I love this so much. I know it's going to be a huge pain for several categories of apps.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.840]   Some of them I don't care about like virus antivirus app. I have always avoided KO files because
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.960]   I don't want to modify my Colonel. And anytime I see a program that says,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.200]   oh, you're going to have to install this KXT and I'm just saying, yeah, maybe not. Maybe not.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.880]   Well, you don't want it to because they get to write the rules. They get ring zero access.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.520]   They get the system level. And that means that you cannot enforce any policies on them because
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.360]   they get to decide what the policy is. So if they just, if they are malware, there's nothing
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.200]   that's going to protect you because the malware is suddenly running things. So what this model
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.320]   does is it takes all of those things out of Colonel space and puts them in user space. It has
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.840]   System Extensions, driver kit, a whole bunch of things that keeps developers out of the Colonel
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.600]   and gives them a space where they can safely make their apps. So in Siri, no third party
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   will be able to make anything that runs in Colonel mode in system in ring zero mode.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   Everything will run in user space except Apple specific Apple products.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.080]   Yeah. And those are all called signed in the check every stage of the boot up.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.520]   And there's no downside to this. Anybody who's using the biggest hit is going to be people who
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.240]   are using really old hardware that absolutely will not work without a Colonel level extension or
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:02.080]   it's old and the KXT is not being updated into a system level extension. But those people are
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:07.360]   probably going to be using older Macs anyway and they will still be able to download and install
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.080]   older versions of the Mac OS and Apple doesn't make it easy to find but they're there in the
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.680]   support in the support webpage. So there's no downside. This is long, long overdue. And there's
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.600]   nothing that there's nothing that makes my teeth tingle so much as when I'm installing a piece of
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.560]   software and says your Mac needs to restart after this installation. Say it doesn't have to if I
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.920]   don't install you. This is this only becomes a I want fingerprints. I want your social security
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:39.040]   number. I want everything to know about every developer who ever worked on this before. I will
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.240]   let you install a KXT. ZDN has a good interview with Patrick Wardle. He's the Jamf principal
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.040]   security researcher and has written a lot of Mac security tools we've recommended before. He says
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.160]   you know this is this is basically a good thing. The downside is well the old days of having a
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:01.120]   Mac that you could completely control and completely modify are gone and Mac is more now Mac OS is
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.920]   more now like iOS. But I think for end users that's a good thing and Wardle who writes a lot of
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.960]   security tools is happy with the system extensions. He says there's some great user mode frameworks
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:16.000]   that provide third party security tools the capabilities they need. So he's able to still
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.840]   write his tools without having to be a kernel extension. So I guess it's encouraging.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:27.200]   My guess they Jamf probably had some input. They do a lot of stuff.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.240]   If they're saying that it's going to work I think that's probably a good sense of it.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.360]   He says third party kernel extensions pose a juicy attack vector.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:45.440]   That would be the company that would probably be one of the few companies that would really
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.800]   go crazy. Because they do customization for enterprise users. Big enterprise install management.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.120]   If they can get done what they need to get done I think that we're in pretty good shape.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.760]   Typically antivirus uses it. Firewalls VPN clients.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.920]   Drivers probably use it. USB drivers and others. They have driver kit now.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.040]   So you can do a driver's even. I would think it'll make the system more stable.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.120]   Not merely more secure but more stable. I agree.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:20.320]   I often look for the dark lining to any silver cloud but in this case it's hard to say that.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.760]   That's not a. That's not a.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.080]   Well one less reason to want to do a clean install every three four red clean install every
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.880]   year. So I you got a pad apple in the back. It's hard to take an existing legacy operating
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.920]   system. Especially one that's you know 40 years old and make it secure. That's one of the reasons
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.360]   mobile operating systems are more secure. They're they're newer. But Apple has done a great job
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:49.120]   with OS 10 of moving into the 21st century. And I think gatekeeper and and this are huge steps
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.240]   for it. It's one of the reasons you don't really need an antivirus on Mac OS.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.520]   Unless well you'd install that stupid flash. They flash thing.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.480]   You know I mean social engineering fishing all that kind of stuff is still a huge vector.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.880]   And it's is more now because Mac is a more economical target for hackers than it used to be.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.000]   It's yeah. Apple is I think that it's they this is one of the benefits they have of the
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.320]   relationship with customers. I I do think that their version of two factor authentication is
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:21.600]   such a pain in the butt by default where I'm expecting to get a text on my phone instead I have to
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.440]   dig out my iPad because it's looking for another Apple authenticated device. But the thing is
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:34.720]   it's secure. Yeah. Right. It's it's easy. It's given that it's so easy to spoof to get someone to
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.200]   to create a new SIM card for you if you want to do something bad to a specific target. It's like
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:46.000]   I begrudgingly say. Okay. I suppose in the name of not being clav and not not having my bank accounts
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.880]   my Bitcoin cleaned out. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I do and I have to say moving away from 32 bit apps
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:00.080]   has been somewhat painful. Yes. A surprisingly large number of apps even though they've had
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.840]   years to prepare are just part of the problem. Like they gave them literally 10 years and I think
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.160]   nobody like if they'd given them a year maybe the same programmers they would have all done it
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.680]   immediately. But now like for the games they're saying like the people who worked on those games
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.920]   they're not there anymore. Long gone. Nobody's left to port those games. Yeah.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.480]   I have a sense that some of the ones that I know that that I have I still have my laptop is still on
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:29.440]   hobby. I can't because I have an app that I absolutely need and it costs $6,000 to replace it.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.200]   If it if it does. There's no other there's no other Mac plot you know there's I use the thing
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:39.040]   called Mac captions which is kind of industrial strength captioning tools you know to fix all the
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.360]   captions and export them to different formats and there's only one Mac program that does that
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.560]   Telestream makes this thing called Mac captions and it's still on 32 bit. I don't they haven't told
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.520]   me why they haven't upgraded but they have a big warning when you go to buy it. Hey this hasn't
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.440]   been upgraded and I think that it's because they haven't sold enough of them they're looking at
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   the math they're looking at how much it's going to cost to fix it and how much you know like they're
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.760]   looking at at does this make sense to keep moving forward. What's the use of an accounting package a
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.960]   lot of people use they said we'll never be 64 bit that's it but a lot of audio plugins too.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.880]   Yeah but I think that comes down to how many they're just looking at how many did they sell and
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.840]   how many are they you know there's no upside they don't we say there's no trajectory for it.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:25.440]   We use a cheque scanner for check deposits from a bank big bank well-known bank national bank
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:31.360]   and it turns out this is you still Catalina it stops working yeah and Lisa spent all day yesterday
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.840]   you know figuring out how to work around this case you're wondering aperture stuff working.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:46.800]   This is why you can't you don't know the situation for each developer just like Alex said it costs
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:55.040]   money to to keep a coding operation up and running and if you if you have only limited a number of
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.240]   expertise and limited number of hours you can either invest those hours into creating features
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:06.560]   that your users want or you can invest those hours in creating a kept in dealing with 64 bit
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.120]   which is a feature that you don't think is going to hit you in the neck for another few years at least
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.520]   and the other part of this is that in the last two or three years I can't tell you how many time
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.600]   conversations I've had with developers where they're trying to do the right thing and they're trying
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.000]   they've been told and warned hey we have to make sure you have to you make things work with 64
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.360]   bit and they're trying to but Apple keeps giving them contradictory answers and I'm not talking
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.240]   about they're searching for on for information on a website and one web one web page from that
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Apple says one thing another web page says another I'm saying they have they have long-term
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.520]   relationships with people inside developers support and they keep getting when they make
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.240]   a complaint saying hey but you broke this this thing that I need to make my app work you you broke
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.640]   this in the latest release and two weeks later you get a response that we don't consider this a
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.520]   problem you need to update your your apps for 64 bit and when you say back well I am trying to but
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.000]   I can't because this thing that you gave me as a replacement for this 32 bit code that I was relying
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.600]   on does not work anymore and so it's it's it's a terrible terrible situation for developers to be
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   in and I just wish that Apple were not so cavalier at times about the difficulties of making your
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:20.960]   app continue to work in 2020 yeah speaking of two-factor Apple has joined the Fido Alliance
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:29.440]   which is I think really good news Fido which stands for fast identity online is industry
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:37.760]   association including Google Amazon Samsung PayPal that supports hardware keys UBECO it makes Fido
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:44.480]   compatible keys and this is really good news because that's probably the most secure way you can
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.320]   death to passwords death to all passwords yeah that would be nice and I carry a Fido
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.920]   utf utf I just keep thinking of the Canadian carrier it takes my brain three seconds every
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.720]   time to realize you're not talking about the Rogers sub-brand Fido Fido was founded I didn't
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.520]   know this in 2013 by a group including Lenovo and PayPal to address the lack of interoperability

[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:41.680]   wow you're out of control finding apple 55 minutes of revenue for secretly slowing down
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:49.280]   iPhones miniac well it's Thomas I would you better register yeah I don't even is that even a word
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:55.920]   miniac and the Samsung the French song drink Samsung today just I was dead I just need people to be
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:05.680]   better French please please it is a big fine on the surface of it 25 million euros this is something
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:11.440]   that apple cops to remember the brew haha they slowed the phones down if the battery was old
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:18.080]   their premise was complete by the way completely credible which is this because the battery is weak
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.600]   if the phone starts doing a lot of work it not only not only could it burn out the battery
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.280]   but it could crash the phone and we don't want that to happen and I think that what was happening
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.120]   before is I had older phones that had you know that obviously have been charged many many times
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.960]   and you get to like 40 percent and just know it's gonna turn off like you know you just got to a
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.600]   point where I was the phone was they didn't want to get the the iPhone operating a situation where
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.280]   the battery was so low where a spike in demand would shut down the phone shut the battery yes
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.040]   that's just not however they cop to it that's why they offered that great battery replacement
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:56.160]   program for very little money my mom took advantage of it was a great deal but apparently the French
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:03.040]   have now gone around around to this a couple of years later and they find him 27.4 million
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:10.880]   dollars that's 55 minutes of revenue shocking apple I'm sure we'll just say okay it's not a
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.560]   bad decision because like a lot of these like there's a bunch of spurious lawsuits but a lot of
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.000]   these are about this is about the communications and if you could fault apple for anything here
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.680]   like they did the right thing technologically but they did not communicate it anywhere nearly an
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.320]   effective way yeah communication would have solved this right and part of the things they fixed were
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.480]   not just the replacement program but also making that an actual surface lip-o-option
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.360]   and making making sure people know exactly what's happening with their with their phones due to
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:44.160]   the age of their battery yeah took the french two years to figure that they investigated for two
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.040]   years you know I don't really have much of a problem with this it's a small fine
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.960]   not insignificant but a small fine apple peels a couple of bills off the outside of the wall
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.680]   and yeah you know but I think they'll do better from now I think they need to have a button that
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.960]   just says age gracefully or die quickly and then you just decide which one you want your battery
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.360]   that's kind of what they do now right yeah essentially what they say that that yeah yeah but but it's
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.560]   still a valuable move the government gets to assert that they have the right to impose fines that
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.840]   we can basically tell you what you cannot do with your technology inside our borders with our
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.760]   citizens and it also establishes a ground floor or precedent so that if they get upset with apple
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.440]   again they can use that existing hey we apple admitted to this we find them and obviously that
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.600]   wasn't enough so now we have to put the hurt on them even greater there's there's a lot of this going
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:42.160]   on in the EU right now where it's it seems like an insignificant fine but you remember that the
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.920]   precedent to Facebook getting a five billion dollar judgment against it by the justice department
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.720]   was a real slap on the wrist a simple like we agreed to go forth and send no more
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.600]   once you have the once you've let this person skate with on probation the first time it means
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.120]   you get to lock them up the second time good news for android users
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.880]   you can now log on to iCloud.com in your browser
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.680]   which means if you're using iCloud you're not locked out either on your browser or on your
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:19.040]   mobile I actually don't understand but in the past it was a long walk out it was mobile it would
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.640]   just detect the mobile site and then freak out and if you told it to load the desktop site instead
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.600]   you were fine but that's an annoying right user experience something you can't necessarily do
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.720]   in every browser either so that means you can use notes you can use photos you can use reminders
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.560]   you can use find my iPhone from a mobile device without having a switch to desktop mode
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.720]   it's an acknowledgement that a lot of people don't have the choice of using an iPhone their
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.280]   company issues them like an android phone so yeah this is this is why they really need to
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.640]   extend and embrace where it's practical to so I'm glad to see this. Do they used to make
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.320]   an iCloud well I called it iDrive or something what do they call it what do they call it what
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.960]   was the Apple yeah there was an iCloud assistant for Windows yeah they don't make that anymore
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.840]   do they no they still making it they're still making it they're still updating it I know because
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:16.800]   I got an alert I got it was so nice guys and sorry people it was so nostalgic because the pop-up
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:24.240]   saying oh there's an update for for iCloud on my Lenovo it's like oh my god it's like the 20
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.560]   the 20 oh five Apple user interface where you see the way that we used to always see like a
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.960]   request for updates so yes so A it was an exciting piece of like oh what kind of music would I listen
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.240]   to in 2002 where they were all the Star Wars prequels out yet but yes they're still updating
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.920]   it they're still at least keeping it up to date. I'm sure that it'll work about as well as the
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   iTunes it says on my god. By the way after Renee you talked to us about the confusion over
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.040]   encryption with iCloud backup and stuff I just decided I turned off iCloud backup on my phone
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:06.720]   I got a USB-C to lightning cable and I backed my iPhone to my laptop and actually it was a little
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.000]   there was a little payment because they've changed this in Catalina it doesn't nothing pops up I thought
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.960]   is music gonna pop up what's gonna happen when I plug in nothing happens you open the finder and
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   lo and behold one of your finder items is now your iPhone and once you open that you get that same
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.920]   interface I click the box it says make sure it's encrypted gave it a strong password
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.640]   and backed it up to my laptop which is then backing up to the cloud that makes me feel a lot better
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.880]   because now it's encrypted trust no one encryption on my Mac and even though it's in the cloud it's
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.120]   it's although didn't we find out today that the CIA has been backing the world's biggest
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.480]   encryption company isn't that interesting what a story that was like since it ran hostages into
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:55.920]   Falkland Islands war yeah uh what is it 40s crypto AG yeah it goes back to the world war two
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.280]   yeah the intelligence that was built by the washington post is the intelligence coup of the century
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:11.920]   for decades more than half a century a company called crypto AG which got started making code
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   making machines for US troops during world war two was owned by the CIA that it was a
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:26.800]   quote swiss firm and this was sold encryption equipment to 120 countries well into this century
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:36.240]   including Iran military juntas in Los Latin America India Pakistan even the Vatican secretly owned by
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:42.160]   the CIA in partnership with West German intelligence they were rigging the devices each and every one
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:49.440]   of them so that they could break the codes they could read geez Louise this is why this underscores
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.920]   what i've always said no crypto is safe unless it's open source you have to know you have to have
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.600]   you have to be able to and Matthew green from john's opkins and other crypto experts have to be
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.000]   able to look at that code and say this is doing what it says it does and nothing else and even
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.920]   then even then like mostly safe mostly safe but any any binary blob that's doing crypto or machine
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.640]   well a lot of this most people didn't have the any way to analyze it in the up and you know right
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.560]   until more recently yeah it was very hard for them to see what was what was going on
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:32.960]   incredible the NSA controlled every aspect of crypto's operation hiring decisions this technology
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.640]   decisions they sabotaged its algorithms they told it here's who you should sell your next machine
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.120]   too they monitored the Iran moles during the hostage crisis they fed intelligence about
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:51.040]   Argentina's military to Britain during the Falklands war holy cow it does make you a little like how
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.480]   do we screw things up so badly when we had all this well you know why it was the enigma problem
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:01.600]   right yes after all in touring and cracked the enigma machine they couldn't use the intelligence
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:08.480]   they got because it would tell the Germans we've cracked enigma right so it's kind of a
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:15.120]   catch 22 you can break the encrypted transmissions but you can't use what you've learned well there's
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.640]   a lot of things that we have to be careful how you use it there's yeah there's a lot of information
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.440]   that we in the past that we haven't used because because of that yeah well we'll also never know
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.400]   how many third parties were able to crack this encryption because it was left somewhat open so
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.840]   that the United States could tap into it and that's the that's the other problem of whenever any
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.600]   government official tells you well who can who the only person who has the other person who has the
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.320]   keys to decrypt the stuff on your phone is the government and we're only going to do it under
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.880]   the diarist of circumstances well that's scary enough but if anybody if one person with authority
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.800]   can get in and crack your crack into your phone potentially there are so many clever people out
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.240]   there who will find that exploit and use it and not tell anybody about it and i'm gonna but i'm
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.560]   gonna take this story with a grain of salt despite known methods fbi claims it still can't unlock
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.120]   the iPhones in the pencil cola case she it's said we now live in a world where you just
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:23.920]   you can't trust anything but there was a score that came out i forget the names but they said that
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.880]   they absolutely could and that it was the wrong hill for bar to die on because it was widely known
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.680]   that they could get into those easily and oh it was it was talking about apple using hashes to
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:40.400]   find child pornography there was a big report on that today on um on Forbes uh yeah not contributor
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:47.440]   network Forbes actual Forbes on that where they was uh because of a lawsuit apple apple detailed how
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.320]   they do that process and it includes they look for the hashes if they find uh like a strong
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.400]   evidence of the hashes they have a human review it then they detail it to an organization that
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.320]   specializes in it which then coordinates with the police but they were saying that there's so much
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.640]   cooperation going on there it was really dumb sort of threaten that relationship with something
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.400]   that they could absolutely already do so i don't know whether to believe christopher ray
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:20.160]   or what he is testifying before the hasdred ishiary committee so he's theoretically uh
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:28.080]   under oath uh they they remember that the shooter shot the iphone and ray said told the
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:34.960]   committee today that that they'd reconstructed that iphone and uh it's currently uh the fbis
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.000]   currently engaged with apple hoping to see if we can get better help from them so we can get access
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.360]   to that phone it's a checkmate phone i mean like i don't we don't have to believe anybody it's a
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.640]   checkmated phone yeah i just that's the problem these days again they want they want the president
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.080]   they want the pressure to have federal law that requires uh companies come what may to
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.440]   to give uh the government give law enforcement access to phones they don't care about the shooter
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.320]   they don't care about this case they want the president yeah i agree with you uh apple pay
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:17.680]   expected to see in the next couple of years some good results uh this is uh juneper research which
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:24.160]   keeps an eye on transaction markets says they expect apple will see global apple pay transactions
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.160]   of six hundred eighty six billion dollars by twenty twenty four that's more than half
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.640]   of the market more than half of the market and i have to say for all the
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.920]   uh you know complaining and bitching about this and all that saying how hard is it to get a credit
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.400]   card out i do notice i use it more and more i that's the only time i ever pay at whole foods
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.080]   i pay with my apple and i and i put i move money into my apple cash because it holds foods it's
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.560]   much faster like well it places like that it's like it's not asked i know it's not gonna ask me
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.600]   for a pen i know it's not gonna ask for anything else it's apple cash it just goes it's just gone
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.320]   and and it immediately is is approved well apple card same thing it doesn't ask for anything more
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.760]   yeah so it's just super fast and and i think that uh plus you get cash back right right and
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   well and i still think that the i always have cash in my apple cash account because of that
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.880]   well and i it's still like magic money you know like you know like someone sent me a
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.400]   couple grand in in uh apple cash and it was just like this magic somebody likes you
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.080]   well you're trying to train back and forth so that's how it is with venmo and me i feel like
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.000]   somebody pays me with venmo that's not money that's just granny just like you know like the cloud
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.800]   you just keep on eventually you run out of whiskey so anyway so so but the uh it's uh it's uh i
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.400]   still think the the one inefficient point here i mean apple has a credit card apple has the
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.960]   bill to do this they're gonna move that much cash i still feel like eventually the inefficient point
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.320]   here is banks in general i mean apple still good might as well just replace that why don't
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.120]   might have just give you a little cost of what they're saving oh i'm blanking on it do you remember
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   lory they just got a new file format support today oh yeah ofx so um you can export your
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:11.680]   transactions up until today you could export them through a csv file but excuse me but um
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:21.600]   not all third party um finance apps support the csv so apple just today updated to support the ofx
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.280]   which is um oh it's more open source so most of the third party financial and budgeting apps support
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:34.240]   that so you can now export it that way and put it into like your you know um you need a budget or
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.880]   mint or something like that um you can kind of uh you can put those um transactions into those apps
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:49.920]   now uh part of the reason that they expect a big growth in apple pay is the growth in apple watches
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.960]   wow um we just saw now nobody knows how many watches apple has sold it's all kind of guesswork
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.040]   because apple doesn't say right no but like cyborg and uh Horace Dejef have figured figured
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:09.440]   out pretty closely i just saw one we talked about it earlier on ios today i can't remember
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:16.800]   who it was one of the strategic research companies said apple sold 31 million apple watches in 2019
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:25.840]   making it it's larger than the entire swiss watch market right all of them like all of them together
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.160]   yeah in the entire and remember how uh people were saying oh this is just going to be great for
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.920]   swatched apples just gonna be leegered yeah well i think the thing for me is that it's not like i'm
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.560]   super excited about my apple watch but i could never go back you know to no no i don't like that
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.320]   whole thing is i couldn't go back to a regular watch i mean that's that'd be absurd so so it's
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.120]   so i think that that is the hard part i mean i you see people with with regular watches and you're
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.760]   kind of like oh you're being really retro you know like you're expecting to have i will say i will
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.640]   i love my apple watch and i don't wear any other watch anymore this is the watch i wear you know and
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:09.920]   i had great watches before i met i had one citizen i have a i have a drawer of beautiful yeah expensive
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:16.080]   right watches yeah they're all that place i can't do without this that said developing an apple
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.640]   watch that can last more than a couple days on battery is still important not to correct for me
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.680]   well i'm just i'm saying for my own example because i i have lots of different wearables that i
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.080]   really really like no no one less than the the apple watch but there came a day when yet again
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   i needed to get out the door and looked as as i often do because again i got these hairy arms and
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.600]   the the the band like kind of winter watch of exactly of both again as i say i'm genetically
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.360]   build harry or berry but either way there are there are communities that would prefer that as berry
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.480]   that's fine i'll take i'll take all compliments but just i mean just to make myself look a little
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.840]   bit less like an idiot so oftentimes if i'm like riding a riding like all day at some point i might
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.440]   take my watch off and just put it next to the keyboard and then forget i put it there and then
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.080]   i have to get out of i have to get out of the house the next day and oh i forgot to recharge my watch
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.920]   and after x days where should this happen and i just put on my casio g-shock watch that i bought
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:20.800]   like about ten years ago that so slowly became my daily default watch simply because i never
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.120]   have to think about it i just have to put it on there's a couple of things wrong with this one
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:32.800]   you're wearing a watch to tell what time it is which is insane well two it's like to be on time
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:40.400]   for things leo well okay that's uh two how hard is it to put your i have one of those little uh i
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.640]   mac uh rubber i mac things that they sold that you know you put your apple watch in there oh they're
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.880]   so cute it's just automatic i just whenever i take off the watch that's where the watch lives my
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   wrist is so cold without the watch on now like if i move around i feel the air on my wrist and it
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:57.120]   just says not normal not normal you're missing and then the time is almost completely secondary
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.360]   although i do have to say with series five now that the time's always on i appreciate it but honestly
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:08.320]   it's all the other things the watch does including recording uh drafts timing activity i think i
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:15.040]   probably use timers well that stuff is so great well okay and i'm glad you i'm not saying that you're
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:21.360]   wrong for liking those things i'm just saying that you're wrong i'm not i would love i would love to
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.800]   be the sort of person that every single day goes at the end of the day goes from room to room taking
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.720]   glasses and putting them in the sink and watching them and putting them away and making sure that the
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.840]   socks aren't on the floor they're in the hamper sometimes i will leave my watch someplace where i
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:41.920]   forget about it and they and as your other point the great thing about my g-shock is that when i'm
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.120]   like moderating panels like a comic-con's i don't want to use the apple watch for that because
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.520]   i press one button on this watch and it's a stopwatch and when i when i need to check to see oh how long
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.720]   are we going on time it will always be a stopwatch when i look at it i don't have to go through eight
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   pages of notifications and then turn off like the the animated Pixar logo so i'm saying that the i'm
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.040]   i'm not saying that the apple watch is problematic because it doesn't it only last couple days on
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.480]   battery i'm saying that that will be as a biggest success as it is it will be an even bigger breakthrough
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:21.600]   when apple figures out how to make the battery last most long enough that forgetting to charge it
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.680]   overnight on a single night won't screw you for the rest of the day i just don't know why you haven't
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:33.040]   explained this to your valet and just have him pick it up every day put it on the charger that's
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:39.280]   what i do uh that's that's that's that's his sock darning time he doesn't give my socks a fair neck
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.880]   bixby should do it for you strategy bixby they mentioned bixby i was shocked don't say
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.800]   mention that word upwards of three devices will automatically figure in the world
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:57.200]   it was strategy analytics that came up with this 31 million units in 2019 a 36% jump over last year
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:05.520]   the entire switch wash industry including swatch and tag hoyer 21 million units and they went down
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.560]   13% so clearly and have they they said what the what the android version of the the oh there's
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:17.280]   zero point one percent they're kind of just you know sam song didn't sam song has a new watch
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.840]   they didn't even mention it it's like yeah they get the word i think they're the best of those
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.400]   watches they're easily the best way better than anywhere ones uh google's pretty much a band in
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   android where uh they haven't done a new one for a while and you know fossil makes the best
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.200]   android where watches but i i can't imagine that's more than one percent of them it's super interesting
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:43.440]   to me that um the like apple have made the iphone and then they they move that o_s to tablets and now
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.880]   to watches and google has not been able to move android successfully to tablets or watches and
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.760]   qualcom is just like it's so expensive to make watch silicon that they haven't been able to it's sort
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.880]   of like a chicken in the egg problem you're like oh you're not making chips you're not making
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.800]   bits and it just keeps going back and forth well i also think that that the android market is very
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:08.000]   big but i don't think that this the consumer is the same type of consumer that necessarily
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.600]   wants to accessorize all their electronics together in the same way the mass the big chunk of it there's
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.040]   definitely there's definitely a large they do their own sam song who are uh who are buying sam
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.320]   songs and and and getting you know high-end phones but when we think about the android market as a whole
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.120]   a lot of those folks are just coming in to buy a phone you know they're not you know and and it
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.280]   happens to have android on it and they don't they're not really buying it because of that
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.000]   one's this one's this one's available in in red great i'll tell you i want the red one what is it
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.400]   operating system and it does facebook don't care exactly yeah yeah so i think and he is this your
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:47.360]   watch this is the watch you wear right here just out of curiosity that's still a very stylish and
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:57.200]   fashionable watch he said g-shock also can also can i say i can i can swim with i can swim in salt
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.200]   water with it i can drop it off of a building it's it's called the g-shock for a reason man it will
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.520]   lasso it will it will dig me up in my gr uh dig up my grave in like 10 years after i die it will
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.600]   still be running despite floods despite my turning and in my sleep battery in it though or does it
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.440]   just every every three years or four years i bought this i got calculated by the way i bought it and
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:28.000]   you can still get it it's only 18 bucks the twice root model it has a little stylus in the in the
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.680]   side because you can't your fingers can't press those buttons mine didn't have a stylus can i
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:36.720]   can i say it's it's actually it's actually pretty cool all of these vintage watches from like the 80s
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.840]   it's not even like a retro line they just kept making them and i did buy the stainless steel
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:47.280]   version of like the that gold watch you first you first show as a joke for because it was like 13
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:53.600]   dollars and again it's a watch that tells you know time and i kind of like it for 12 dollars i
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.560]   almost felt like i didn't want to have to think about whether i wanted to buy this it's like i
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.200]   solved the problem of whether i want to own this or not it's watches are such an interesting
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:10.240]   consumer choice it's it's it's not necessarily features it's not necessarily logic there's just
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:16.160]   something about the design and the features of this particular model that exactly that's the one
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.960]   that that kind of speaks to you and again for some reason the g-shock and the g-shock is the one
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:28.160]   for me it does have bluetooth i can like use an app to like automatically have messages and whatever
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:33.840]   pipe to it but i never use it and it has a nice patina on it where where the plastic case has like
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.960]   rubbed a little bit so it's a little bit glossy again i i was writing all day today so of course my
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.480]   watch has been taken off it's probably in the bedroom but i look at this watch and i said there's
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:50.080]   a i look at it and i see there's a guy who has sideburns that's what i that's what i know that's
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.440]   that's what i see there you go oh i see you have a nice strap you got a little baby yodas
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.680]   feet face you can't do that with a casio and i and i think what's interesting is that is that we
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.920]   went from there was a lot of like personality of what kind of watch you buy before the apple watch
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.240]   where you know you had there are people who got the citizen watches or the seica watches or the
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.040]   or the you know the different you know whatever that is and then it just all went away you know
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.440]   for all a huge portion of the population is just like oh and then there's we're just all gonna have
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.280]   this thank god the best way to express my individualities to have the same watches everybody else thank
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:35.040]   you apple i am so much more but you can now choose your watch face you you know except that you can't
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.640]   you can rely on you know i have different watch that i think it's a what
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:45.680]   together but different what's the android slogan i forget yes different together different together
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.720]   the worst slogan by the way ever it makes no sense at all um
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:22:00.320]   judge has approved the t-mobile merger throwing out the state uh attorney's general case
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:07.680]   against uh t-mobile and sprint merging facility i mean there is one final hurdle i think
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:16.400]   um the california x will be yeah california yeah the judge said we can't be sure it'll be bad
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:21.200]   for competition so i'm not gonna know this this thing is history time isn't an instant there's no
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:26.480]   we don't look at it because i am a robot who was just booted up ten seconds ago and was not given
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.640]   access to the internet it does sound like a robot i have no reason i gotta listen to this is this
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.840]   is what judge victor marrero wrote the resulting stalemate leaves the court lacking sufficiently
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.480]   impartial and objective ground on which to rely on basing a sound forecast of the likely
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.560]   competitive effects of a merger i got an email from bell canada like two days ago saying they're
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.520]   hiking my basic plan by ten dollars yeah like from fifty eight to sixty eight dollars just to continue
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.160]   to improve the quality of my service judge says felt he was failed to be convinced that the merged
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.680]   party would pursue any competitive behavior that's that's soon after the merger directly or
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.480]   indirectly would yield higher prices or lower quality for wireless telecommunication services
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.240]   why would they do that ask the judge i mean but but who's using sprint well that's the real truth
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:17.280]   of it is is sprint in fact he did say this the court is substantially persuaded sprint does not
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.600]   have a sustainable world-term i think it was a strategy exactly well i mean i think it was good
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.920]   to sprint customers to have sprint not be there anymore because it was a dead format and if anyone's
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:33.040]   going to disrupt stuff it is going to be T-Mobile like they're they're more likely actually i'm rooting
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.280]   for this merger because i i think that this will be a better combined they will be there's a shot
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.320]   because the ceo is aggressive you know it's gone unfortunately he's leaving today's retiring yeah
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.440]   or not retiring what he's i don't know he's doing pursuing other interest and do a lot of slow
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.760]   cooking more time with his money yeah and i was joking he's gonna have found a startup that
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.480]   lets people order rides to take them to coffee dates with comedians
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.400]   so there's the cpuc the california public utilities commission is the last and it is not a roadblock
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:09.040]   it is a little more like a speed bump uh once they approve the transaction it will happen so
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:14.480]   if you've been waiting and wondering the new york california canada get hawaii a little
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.440]   in maryland michigan minnesota org and wisconsin massachusetts pennsylvania virginia d c lawsuit
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.960]   is now over
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:29.200]   uh all of those states attorneys generals were just headed the wrong end of the stick there i'm glad
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.720]   that just as per field do any of you use t-mobile i am a t-mobile customer yeah i've used it i don't
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.080]   have it right now but i i have well my problem is i have a little bit of everything so uh but the
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.400]   t i my iphone is using t-mobile right now okay why what do you ask what do you want i was just
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.560]   curious because i i didn't think i just remember the one there was this i forget which samson
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.400]   galaxy it was we were all in new york and they gave at that point samson didn't want to actually
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.720]   have to pay for review units so they would get the carriers to put the bill and only sprint was
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.640]   willing so they gave out all these galaxy aid or galaxy not i think it was galaxy seven or eight
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.920]   phones to everybody on sprint and then no one could get a connection and it was really variable
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.360]   that any functioning in if you're in kansas city sprint works great
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.480]   well i'm really variable it's very location based the big thing you can't say one carrier is
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.800]   better everywhere but it's not the case we we had a pretty good view of it because of the live
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.320]   use you know because we would be watching our live u modems all the time and there was always
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.800]   like don't they do multi multi carrier that's why we that we could tell what oh i see all over the
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:33.440]   u.s we could tell how the carriers were doing it was always verizon that was the best uh it it went
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.280]   actually back and forth between verizon and atnt and every once in a while you'd have a city that
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.440]   did really well in t-mobile right but sprint was always like weird little like it was like it was
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.280]   like barely using the modem and we were like why did they even put them in here you know well and
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.000]   i don't know who it was i think it was rene said the the evil word ymax and that's what happened to
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.800]   sprint yeah they went all in on ymax instead of lte and that and i worry that millimeter wave is
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.080]   going to be the same thing that's the gonna be a relatively unit and it's never going to be a
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:04.240]   consumer technology like a stadium technology yeah the y millimeter wave is another ymax and
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:12.560]   that all this 5g hype is bs well especially i mean atnt can get away with not just like
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.880]   in advertising claiming that their lte is 5g but also have like a pip appear like actually the
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.800]   actual status bar of the iphone saying hey you've got 5g such bs such bs like gross oh which i think
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.600]   we were going back and forth on twitter when when my phone is on 5ge i assume that it's going to be
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   worse than lte because it does it's wonky and it doesn't suddenly it i'm not going to work as well
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:41.040]   as i was working before it's actually a good reason not to get the same s20 because you have to get a
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.080]   5g variant which means battery life is more expensive contract so they wear that the battery
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.920]   life is going to be better with their new modem they swear that battery life won't be affected
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.440]   because if you don't have 5g that whole part of the modem oh that's just shuts down but i'll
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.120]   believe that when i see it well they did again it's like you're paying for that chip regardless of
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.480]   whether you're that server or not and that doesn't sit well with me and there is a reason they put a
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:05.920]   5000 milliamp power battery in there yeah and i have a feeling it might have something to do with a 5g
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.080]   let's take a break uh there was a announcement that i was gonna but i think i'll let one of you
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:18.720]   save it for your pick of the week that's what's coming up next i didn't want to step on anybody's
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.480]   pick of the week our show today brought to you and you know this i don't have to tell you by our
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:32.320]   favorite product ever last password big fans and of course last i've been using last pass for 10
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.680]   years now since they started it became clear to me very early on that there was no way i was
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.720]   gonna have good password hygiene you just can't remember hundreds and hundreds of passwords
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.720]   so what do you do you either come up with memorable passwords and and more likely what you do is
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.120]   you have one password just use it again and again and again i did that for a long time that's such a
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:59.040]   bad idea because with all the breaches going on as soon as one site gets breached if you use
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.840]   that password anywhere else they will try it everywhere else and you will get breached again
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.480]   and again and again you got to have a password manager what does a password manager do it generates
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:15.840]   long strong completely random completely non memorable passwords and then keeps track of them
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:22.560]   for you so you don't have to remember them so all the incentive not to use strong passwords goes away
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.240]   it last pass has a security asset that will actually go through all your passwords say you've
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.400]   reused this password you want to change this site this site this site this site now helps you
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:38.000]   get rid of all your bad stuff that security score is so fantastic and you know if you're in business
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.120]   all of the bad things that you do or did before last pass with your passwords your employees are
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:51.280]   doing and then some right passwords down on a post-it note putting on the screen you know there
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.640]   was just a global password security report and uh and in it it said employees reuse a password on
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:07.520]   average reuse a password on 13 different sites and apps 13 that's why when you run that security
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.760]   score if the first time you turn on last pass in your business and run that security score
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:18.080]   47,000 businesses by the way use last pass and do that that the average score was 49 percent that's
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.160]   terrible that means more than half of their passwords are reused or weak the fortunate
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:29.520]   the fortunate thing is last pass will help you fix all that it solves those access and authentication
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:35.120]   challenges for businesses a unified password management vault they also have things like single sign
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.840]   on which does the unheard of it both makes you more secure and it's more convenient they support
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:45.680]   multi-factor that's better than two-factor course they support ubiki and duo security and all the
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:52.000]   sophisticated but they also do multi-factor with things like geo location and ip address to really
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.400]   make sure that the people who are using your bank account and your other resources are the
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:03.040]   people who are supposed to you know and that's in the business that's super important last pass
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:08.720]   has over 1200 single sign-on applications in their vault there that means those are applications you
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.920]   don't need to use a password for your employees can log in but it's more secure it's more secure
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.480]   your data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level so net last pass never gets access to that
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:26.800]   data only you do that's why i trust my last pass vault that's my secure vault on all my devices
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.160]   that's where i put my passport my driver's license my social security numbers that data is secret and
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:38.320]   and your master password and the keys used to encrypt and decrypt data are never sent over the
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.960]   internet they're never sent to last passes servers they're never accessible by last pass
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:50.000]   only you get that as the gold standard in security and they want to stay that way they
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.160]   engage trusted world class third party security firms on a regular basis to conduct routine audits
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.960]   to test the service test the infrastructure so you can use it with confidence why we use last
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:06.640]   pass families at home we use last press enterprise here at twit in my mind this is
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:13.200]   a security no brainer it's table stakes if you're not using last pass you're not doing it right

[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:47.760]   reality food oh my god he's got delicious so i've never been on the table if you've ever been so
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:55.440]   hungry right now look at this this is awesome and unfortunately i can't quite reach it it's way
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.080]   over there i think you can i think you can reset it and then no don't reset it i liked it where it
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.680]   was and then we can put it on the table again yeah put it there it is so close so the thing is this
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:12.080]   is kind of like that i want it it's noodles with the it's the virtual version of scream and caramel
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.480]   like when you're in japan and you always have those kind of plastic dishes out front oh yes like when
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.680]   you walk in except now you can do it right in front so this is a you know this is it's what i'm more
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.120]   interested in is the fact that this is a uh a picture of the future of where i think that we're
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.120]   going to be able to see a lot of things like this where you can eculos you actually get to see what
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.680]   you're going to order um because a lot of us especially when you know the country or in a in a new
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.680]   restaurant um it you know there's uh oh oh there you go and it's zero california
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:49.920]   it's it goes ah bring back the puff things oh daddy so this is this isn't can you integrate this
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.640]   into a fitness app like so augmenting rally you're just running running trying to earn this
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.000]   oh man at the end of your run is like the place we could actually buy the profiterals
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.560]   yeah tundies and cookies in a pan so are these actual i'm not sure if they are not uh you know i
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.000]   just think that it's a it's a great example of ar being actually used in a useful way i think a
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.480]   lot of times we're wondering like why do people why are people going to use ar yeah bakery um and so
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.160]   this is a really interesting you got to kind of give it let it grab on the table
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:28.960]   let's go to scan the tables go through a scan the table place the donuts as as usual if you can
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.920]   if you can attach a technology to one of the seven deadly sins exactly you got to step in your hands
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:40.880]   so this is in its uh kabakkakk it's k-a-b-a-q look at the paisley cake George was asked but it's
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.720]   got all these famous uh places that you can uh you can go eat so and this is a good example by the
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.480]   way if you're wondering what photogrammetry is this is photogrammetry so this is you take a bunch of
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.400]   photos of the of the stuff and you turn it into 3d mod so somebody from kabakk went to the uh you
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.600]   know the uh i have no idea how they did club and but but i can guess my guess is is that they took
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.000]   a little kit to the restaurant had them make it because it looks real yeah because they're taking
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.600]   photographs and then they're turning those photographs into wagyu beef tartar with a mix pickle vegetable
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:20.640]   and truffle purlage burls oh my god oh my god snails out of bilgenyol so it's a slick little app
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:27.360]   barata with tomato tartar avocado and katasau bread are you are you getting noise but a lot of times
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.120]   you get him he's getting no i just no i'm just see i i had plans to just like like make a he hit a
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:39.520]   pecan of soup for dinner yeah i recommend i recommend how Alex every time the tortelloni
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:47.360]   cabanara with pecorino sauce and crispy bacon this is so good anyway i think we're i think we're
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.800]   gonna see this is just the beginning you know i think that we're going to see everything's well
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.000]   wouldn't wouldn't this be a good menu if you went to a restaurant yeah instead of having i mean and
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.400]   you can do it on your phone as well you don't have to use an ipad we just happen to my pad was easier
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.560]   to look at if i want to order a big mac with fries exactly version of it i do think it makes sense
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.520]   more for the kind of restaurants that show in there where they have a really special very that is
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   like i don't know what that is and and there have been times i admit that i've ordered in other
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.400]   countries where i got something completely different than what i expected and so right yeah i love that
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:28.880]   fish with me it's made me so hungry okay kebak kebak kebaq thank you very much Alex Lindsey
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:34.880]   how about you lori gill what do you got for us well i just started watching a tv show that you
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:42.560]   can stream on netflix called a lock and key that's l o c k e and key and it's pretty adorable and
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.600]   pretty fun it's based on a comic book that i actually also read that came out a few years back
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   it's maybe almost ten years ago at this point i'm written by joe hill who's steven king's son
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.320]   and this is sort of like a a teenager's version of of a horror it looks good but i didn't watch
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.080]   it because i thought it was a young adult thing it is it is it's very it's definitely like pg 13
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.680]   but it but it's adventurous but also a little bit dark it's not you know it's not anything that's
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.400]   revolutionary anything but if you're sitting around on a saturday afternoon and you just kind of want
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:22.000]   to you know have something fun on on the background this is it it's not childlike at all but it is
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.040]   you know it focuses on the children in the family it's kind they're the ones that go on this like
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:35.040]   kind of terrifying adventure so mok and but it's it's really really weird the the um original comic
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:42.880]   book that that um written by joe nihill is just very creepy and dark and this kind of it shares
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.040]   that joe hill joe nihill's somebody sorry sorry i didn't miss rejona
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:53.360]   totally different type of person there joe hill for a moment i said oh i know joe nihill wrote stuff
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:39:01.280]   oh no no no joe hill um but it it's it meets that kind of same eerie creepiness but kind of
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:07.520]   gives you the the the teenage or the pg 13 version of it pretty well you know what this is check it out
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.040]   you see my son spending a whole weekend watching yeah yeah i i would i think you would love it
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:17.680]   this segues though into something that is in a way my pick of the week because you notice as i
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:22.640]   am here in nefflix browsing around you notice something different i was gonna i was gonna mention
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.800]   it you notice it's not auto playing the stu i used to i would i would like quickly move the
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.080]   remote control before the auto play started stressful so i didn't have to see the trailers
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:41.200]   yeah this was the biggest irritation on nefflix for years they finally gave you a way to turn
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:46.800]   it off you have to go in on the web weirdly enough and you have to go into your account
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.880]   and then you have to go into an individual account and go to playback settings but look at this they
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.760]   finally added auto play controls you can uncheck and i uncheck both of them the one where you're
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:08.160]   watching us a tv show and it immediately goes to the next one before the credits are over i think
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.680]   the credits deserve to roll so i uncheck that one and then also that's next episode in a series on
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.320]   all devices and then auto play previews while browsing and all devices i uncheck both of those but
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:26.000]   you now have control of that and incidentally that's a per uh account thing so if you have other
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.320]   people on your nefflix account they can decide how they want to have it but i just hate those auto
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.480]   plays i just wanted to mute like i i don't mind if the stuff is moving it's visually interesting
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.120]   oh that's interesting if they didn't have a sound on it that wouldn't be as bad that's what the apple
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.280]   tv plus stuff does it just play like it just plays in the background yeah i don't mind that you're
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.840]   right it's the noise that bothers me so anyway yeah that was such a big story that i was watching
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:53.760]   the local news on uh like on saturday or friday and it was on the local news you know you know you
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.160]   really missed the miss the window miss the miss the target when it's on local news that you took
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:05.040]   away you know like that but like it just in line so he had to scramble to find something new
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.840]   he was gonna pitch about nefflix not a play man why did i win an Oscar i could have done that well
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.520]   too late now yeah and he and i go pick of the week and uh this goes right with your cassia wristwatch
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:22.880]   well see i i want i want to start if i just denying this uh the scurrilous accusation that i'm i'm
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.960]   hopelessly stuck in the 80s okay that i'm i don't like embracing new technology or i think i just
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:36.880]   want to say categorically that i am a modern man of the 2020s and i embrace everything that's new and
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.840]   wonderful and different i might as well so let's go to the pick of the week which the sony walkman
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:52.160]   where yeah but this isn't your father's walkman no no this is it's it's much more modern than a
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.080]   walkman it's actually an iPod oh wow it's about time at least i'm at least in the 20 and look at that
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:03.840]   16 gigs i mean we're talking a thousand songs in your pocket okay yes see this is now this so this
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:11.360]   is like a so the sony digital walkman uh it's uh the sony nwa 55 was just it was released uh overseas
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:17.680]   so late last year just released in the united states uh just a couple of weeks ago um it's now
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:23.040]   i honestly i absolutely respect anybody who's who's looks at this and says why this is no point to this
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.600]   as it does not interest me at all that's absolutely true it's either going to be this is either the
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.640]   sort of advice that is either perfect for how you listen to music or of absolutely no use to you
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.360]   at all now i'm the per i'm the person who i have streaming services i use my streaming services
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:42.640]   when i like an album though i put a ring on it and i buy it by either buying it on cd and uh and
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.960]   transmogrifying it i have 10 000 songs in my library at some point it became uh if there there was a
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:56.720]   lot of sense in deciding well gee for just 220 dollars and a and a uh uh it's uh uh
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:03.040]   40 dollars for an SD card this takes a micro SD storage in addition to the internal like 16 gigs
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:09.040]   i can have my entire music library on this device i don't have to stream anything i don't have to
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:15.840]   deal i don't have to tap through uh uh apple music suggestions i don't have to say hey valentine's day
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.240]   is coming up here's a playlist for people for romantic felt here's a playlist for people who
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.200]   aren't doing anything for valentine's day here's a playlist for for october 12th if you're a little
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.400]   bit late and there's it's like no i want to see the album i was just listening to or i just want to
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:36.560]   get i want to have control over my library also i'm in the position where uh i like the idea of
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:43.120]   having my music on a separate device i also have music uh on my phone but i like the fact that i
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:50.080]   can have this on a separate battery this thing will last of about 40 hours of playback on one charge
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:56.800]   standby time because it doesn't even run ios or android it's just it's it's an embedded os so
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.360]   on standby if i just like charge it once and don't listen to it for a month it will still be almost
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:07.120]   fully charged when i wake up again it has a headphone jack which is also nice it uh
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.320]   supports obviously supports bluetooth it also supports the higher quality uh codecs of bluetooth
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.920]   so aptX HD uh and LDAC so if i have one day i buy like really nice bluetooth headphones i'll get
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:24.240]   the best quality possible and even when it's just on my desktop this will also act as a DAC so if i
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:30.480]   plug this into the usb port of my macbook it will be be identified as an audio output device and i
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:35.040]   can use the the the built-in DAC that's in this device which is probably better than the one that's
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:41.040]   built into the laptop and use it that way it'll also work as a bluetooth receiver so if i want to use
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:48.080]   my fancy fancy uh 60-dollar Sony headphones here uh with my new iPhone that doesn't have a headphone
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.800]   jack i can use i can plug the headphones into this use this as a bluetooth interface for those things
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.400]   um and also you also uh Sony has like snappy covers that are magnetic and really really cool
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.000]   anyway there you can you can spend it's an audio device a category where you can spend up to
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.320]   two thousand dollars for these really nutty uh makes and models but this is exactly up my street it's
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.480]   220 bucks which is about how much i would pay for an iPod touch it's the positive is that it does
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:22.160]   not have Wi-Fi does not have this sort of stuff it's just a music player um and so it is again either
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:27.760]   you will see this and say wow i should do that with my music library or this will have be of
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.880]   absolutely no interest to you whatsoever and i respect that other position but if you are in
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.560]   the position where you have a music library you don't want to have to burn up your
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:43.280]   burn up your uh your phone battery every time or have to choose which subsection of your library
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:48.080]   you want to put on your phone because who has the money to spend for the amount of storage to put
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.200]   on an iPhone so you can actually have your entire music library on the thing and i will also like
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.880]   the i also like that if i'm in the city that i don't want to be tracked by the government i can
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.400]   turn off my phone and still listen to my music this supports high res music and flag
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.480]   yep well i was just through the headphone through the headphone jack yep all the way to the maximum
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:11.920]   that you can buy uh it's questionable whether you can actually hear the difference i i think i can
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:18.000]   on some but i wouldn't put any money on that uh so it will it's very much future proof i did wait
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.200]   to get the the previous models was the was the 40 that had everything except for aptX HD
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:30.640]   it has just plain old apt aptX from Qualcomm HD is kind of misnomer it's not really high definition
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:39.280]   music but it will let you uh stream bluetooth play bluetooth music through 24 bits of audio quality
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.880]   instead of 16 bits so okay it's it's it's a large again it's a provably larger number than 16 so it
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:49.280]   was for me for the same amount of money was worth waiting a few weeks for it i said 16 gigs but
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:56.080]   it'll hold SD cards my exact has 16 gigs built in but also micro SD card the the specs say up
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:02.240]   228 gigs but that's just the highest that they will absolutely promise i have a 256 gig card
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:08.480]   and they're right now i've also tried a 512 gig card the good kind not the cheap alibaba version
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.520]   of it but it all works fine the only thing i will say there's one thing that is absolutely heinous
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:22.240]   about this talk about talk about vintage proprietary charging and data port oh you should have started
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:28.480]   with that i know well it's it well this is this is exactly what i went through it's like i was
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.640]   looking at all there are like three different kinds that i was looking at in terms of a standalone
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.240]   digital music player and this was right at the top of the top of the list for every single category
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:43.200]   except for that proprietary charging port and finally i had to decide that the next one that i
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.840]   wanted that had the features that i wanted would cost me an extra hundred and fifty dollars and i
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.440]   decided i don't want to spend 150 dollars i can spend an extra 20 dollars to get two extra Sony
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:58.560]   charging cables for it and again because i can listen to it probably for an entire week at least
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:03.680]   without having to recharge it it's not as big a pain point as it could be but still there's a
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:10.240]   certain amount of feeling unloved by god and or sony when i discover that note doesn't it doesn't
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:16.880]   come with you as bc you know i really really want is a device like this that'll play my audio books
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:23.440]   and i know the ipod would and the iphone do but you can get you you can get the next step up from
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.880]   this which is which runs android and actually has full access to the google play store so you can
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.560]   you can run audible you can run apple music you can run spotify i didn't i i decided not to get it
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.920]   only because again what i really wanted was i want to be able to not have to worry about char
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.040]   can get like every two or three days and because it's still an indoor device with wi-fi even if
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.720]   you put an end in airplane mode after several days it will probably you'll lose some battery
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.160]   and i just i just decided that it's also another hundred bucks and i'd much rather just get the
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:03.200]   i want to i want to i want to be stuck in the 80s at least for this sort of material very nice the
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:10.160]   sony wakman it's back baby it's bad it's it's it doesn't come with headphones but it should come
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.560]   with earbuds that have like a little orange tips to them yeah that they missed such a perfect
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.320]   trick there oh yeah come with the awesome mix volume three there's something about this that
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:24.880]   maybe it makes me want to like get my son of cassette so much more actually make him like take
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:32.160]   spotify and record it to cassette and then the eight Alex you don't want that my partner has
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:38.800]   a huge collection of cassette tapes that takes up half of the living room you don't want your son
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.600]   getting into that they're all punk though right they're all punk music i hope no it's
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:50.000]   everything he's a tape collector oh no that's yeah get that i i used to have it that i used to have
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.040]   it i mean up until only a couple years ago i had a denan real uh denan cassette to cassette duplicator
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.600]   which i oh we've got three of them i carried i kept that around for a long time yeah because you
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.320]   also have a handlebar mustache and your laughing but after the first three parties they'll be listening
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:11.200]   to music that's true that's a good point rene richie pick of the week so this one it was really
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:16.480]   exciting to me uh they have released a couple years ago flashback apple released uh swift playgrounds
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:21.440]   an ipad app that was designed to introduce people to code apple has this belief that
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.200]   coding should be at least a base level language for everybody that everyone should be taught
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.000]   coding literacy and they followed that up with everyone can code programs and curriculums
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.760]   and today they launched uh swift playgrounds for mac so it's a catalyst app that takes the ipad app
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.480]   and adds things like the menu bar the sidebar all the sort of mac trappings to it and it looks like
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.680]   a really really good catalyst app like i'm hoping this is catalyst app the next generation sort of
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.480]   stuff and you can do multi-windling and you have access to all almost all the same stuff you do on
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:56.480]   the ipad there's no arkits on the mac so you can't do the arkit um parts of swift playground but you
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.720]   can do the robots the drones and it looks like it's getting great support from the third parties
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:05.600]   who support swift playgrounds on ipad already it does the code highlighting you can put the
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.520]   different windows next to each other it's really a mackey mac experience for playgrounds and one of
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:17.200]   the really cool things is you can then take this code cut and paste it into xcode and xcode will
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.360]   just understand it like it'll code highlight it'll do everything for you and then you can start
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:26.560]   making it into apps if you want to so it's sort of like yes it's swift playgrounds for mac but it's
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:34.240]   also a bridge to take people from learning on the ipad from a very young age uh in schools are on
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.200]   their own to being able to take it to that next step and eventually go like you can from iMovie
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.800]   to final cut or from garage band to logic sort of step up and make your own apps one day if you want
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.400]   and not with like a baby language or a demo language or like a four kids language but the same language
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:56.160]   that there are just so many apps on the app store already already being built from so yeah it's
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.920]   just come out today um i don't have any video or anything to show yet because apple doesn't
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.960]   have any big pages up on it yet but you can get it from the mac app store and it's free and if you
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.760]   have a kid who's even at all interested in coding or you wish they were and they don't have access
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:14.160]   to an ipad but they do a mac it's a great thing to let them play around so you think this would be
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:20.960]   a good first language i think the playground version of it like maybe not like if you're like 11 or 12
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.960]   or older i think there's simpler things if you're younger and you just want to learn the basics of
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:30.400]   block you know of programming blocks but this if like if you're if you're 11 12 and you want to
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.760]   make apps one day that's your big dream i think this is a great way to start out because like the
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.960]   same code you're writing is the same code that would be used in an app and you could gracefully
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:49.520]   graduate from one uh to the other nice i'm thrilled they're putting it on the mac uh yeah yeah that's
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:54.080]   great yeah they're just playgrounds it's free of course it's quick playgrounds amazing because it
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.240]   really gives you that massive response lessons though some companies are offering lessons in the
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.800]   swift playgrounds player i think am i wrong but apple is doing like apples are all for millions of
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:07.680]   dollars on this stuff and like yes it does benefit them in the long run but it's also really good for
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.520]   schools who can't afford to get curriculum sort of do this kind of stuff on their own yeah there's
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.840]   some great stuff that's really nice better than a cassette
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:22.400]   but just a little how many cassettes do you think your s o has
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:29.440]   minimum 500 holy cow yeah he's been playing since he was a child too because he listened to
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:34.720]   his username or did you just look at yeah yeah we they listened to have outdated media in our
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.240]   house all the time and yeah he'll he'll buy a tape or two and we'll come home and listen to it and
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:45.040]   sometimes it's warped because it's out because it's that old but wherever he bought it from it's
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:53.360]   all warped but no one else did stuff on tape oh yeah vinyl albums yeah we we both have a huge collection
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.280]   yeah that i understand a little more cassettes were kind of a step down for me we used to get we
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.880]   used to get probably five or ten albums at the radio station every day you know i was music
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.960]   director for radio station all oh no no we did not we we found it the best way if you took 7-11
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:13.040]   cups and you had two of them and then we had a stove in the in the we keep the records up so
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.680]   they get all soft you just keep moving on or they'll or they'll get smooth but you just keep moving
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.600]   them over a gas stove until they get warm and then you put them on top you center one on top of
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.040]   their seven and you push the other one on top of it you pull it out and makes a great vase
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.480]   just that one you we used to have to give away and you always come to the great
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.480]   engine i come here i have a vase of rock over London occasionally you'll open one of those
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:38.240]   sleeves and there be cocaine in there so it's wonderful and the CDs made good shot glasses
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:44.000]   yeah you're so sick and then you get the phone call like left i just want to make sure you got it
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.920]   because you know that was a labor of love after all my family died in that fire i really what saved
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:55.120]   my life was making music and pouring and really that tells the story of my life but you don't
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:03.360]   just listen to it made a great looking at this multi-wob it was mostly you know i would be
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.440]   entered a corner and somebody would turn my music into a vase so don't worry
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.880]   now it's loud by next week lory so you're saying that if anybody wants to come to your house and
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.400]   turn all of those tapes into one big vase well that was our upset that was our upset because rock
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.680]   over London at some point in the middle of it switched from cd which was generating a lot of our
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:29.920]   chalk glasses to that which was just a tape and then you're they sent us a that tape that recorder
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.000]   which we then used for a lot of other things that we shouldn't use but but it was it was great
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.800]   because we had a that that player that you know recorded concerts with was great yeah you know i
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.680]   know i think going back to the old analog days is not the end of the world not the no it's it's
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.720]   it's fine i just don't get like i get like wanting the tapes but then like i buy cds because they're
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:56.720]   dirt cheap now uh second hand but i i always convert them to like digital because otherwise
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.800]   i can't keep i don't want to keep track of them i don't want to like have them piling around so i
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.160]   really surprises me when i hear about people who like are really really into cassettes not as an
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:11.840]   nostalgic thing but this is how they want to use i'm i'm i don't insult people who for for doing
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.240]   that because you you don't have to defend liking what you like but i'm really curious about what it
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:22.560]   is about the experience that makes people want to their their go-to media is a cassette whenever
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.000]   you want to go and enjoy an album that's interesting to me especially when the argument like the i
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.320]   i have my own argument for the final having a warmer sound to it and to me it does sound better
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:42.800]   than digital but tapes don't fit into that exactly and they sound worse and you can't get a new player
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.160]   you because all the new players are just like there's one manufacturer that's making the
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.640]   mechanism and they're just for novelty purposes you have to buy like a 30 year old player and then
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:57.600]   replace all the belts and replace all the it's again i'm fascinated by this approach yeah me too
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:05.200]   the size of one cassette one cassette lorry yeah everything on it
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:15.120]   ladies and gentlemen that concludes mac break weekly for this Tuesday Alex Lindsay now at what is
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.760]   it going on i know media oh nine on media we've changed the lower third already that's how quickly
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:24.880]   we work just like that but the best place to figure it out what Alex is up to is go to at Alex
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.960]   Lindsay l-i-n-d-s-a-y on the twitter i can't promise it'll always be about a mac it's about lots of things
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:37.040]   many many fun things yes how's the kids tik-tok going it's going well we should give a plug to that we
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:42.240]   so we have a new uh it's we we're trying something else i mean we're not as productive as we should
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:45.840]   be because we're working on a bunch of stuff that we're that we're putting out you know we're testing
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.280]   but the last one that we did uh we realized there's all this old sire not live stuff it's really an
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:57.840]   internal joke that no one gets except for us and um so we this is see if you guess it here watch
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:04.880]   watch so this is the Mcdubbies yeah which is really Alex and his kids this one is
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:20.560]   stop it stop it no no effects stop it you don't have to yell oh so i don't know if you remember
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:26.480]   is that David pumpkins what is that it was it was from no it was from uh you don't have to
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:32.400]   you know it was it's a little bit more of a dramatic from anoint man from the 80s it was a
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.720]   john love it uh my family watched a lot of sire not live when i was growing up did the kids have any
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.120]   idea what they were enacting no no they but they thought it was just they just said it'd be good
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:49.360]   they said well i was they i've done it to them most of their life we're in the little thing
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:55.440]   and so they learned to say you don't have to yell so they they i don't even know if they've seen the
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:02.560]   original but in my family it's a very old um thing anyway this is actually kind of fun i have to say
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:06.480]   here's what here's what's fun about tick-tock is just that you you think of something stupid and
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.800]   you go do it really quickly and and when you're done you're done like the one before that i just
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:16.560]   we're testing um this was actually shooting with the camera and i actually took this one i put it up
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:22.000]   on youtube so there's a mcdubbies youtube oh yeah we showed this last year and uh and so and then
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.720]   before that my kids wanted to do green screen so the one before that is a experimented green screen
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.320]   but you think of it and like an hour or two later it's done you know and i gotta tell you the other
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:36.720]   good reason i could never take pictures of my kids they'd hide their faces they said no dad stop it
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.920]   this way you're engaging them and now you have all these great videos of the kids when they're
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:43.600]   a little my my wife was just like she just excited that i have something to do you like that i'm
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.600]   thinking too with the kids keep you busy in the office well the kids the kids and i just have a
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:51.920]   lot of fun on saturday's you know we run around with ideas and and there's there's about five or six
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:56.160]   of them right now that are kind of in middle of development that'll that'll come out soon
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:04.240]   sometimes these special effects take time well the other schedule we went from like making a
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:10.080]   couple to we've got like five different uh of the memes that we're gonna put in make creative story
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.280]   with you know so if you watch them in the animatics that really slow it down get
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:16.240]   used out yeah i understand i do have a database and store
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:22.560]   lory gill thank you so much lory always a pleasure lory's uh managing editor of i'm more at
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:28.640]   apoholic on the twitter don't forget sickburn her fabulous band soon they'll be selling cassettes
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:33.440]   after every show actually funny you should say that not sickburn but another band that i'm in we
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:42.000]   are going to put out a series of four tapes wow so it's um that's very wet for tapes and there
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.000]   there's uh two songs on each and it's going to cost us as much money as it would cost to
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.440]   record to make an album and it's just four tapes and here's the beauty part no one can play it
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.400]   you should you should release on sony hi pack that's even more esoteric
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:06.560]   that they're speaking esoteric that there is andy and notco he's on the radio wgv h terrestrial

[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:36.400]   overcast yeah there's an interesting article yesterday about what spotify is really trying to do
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.120]   is essentially put podcasting out of business because are you listening to any podcast
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.520]   on spotify no but that's the thing they would here's what well we'll talk about you know i'm
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.240]   gonna do it on twig i saved it for twig because it's not really a max story but uh it's an inch
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.120]   i'll talk after we get off about why there's genuine reason to be concerned we can talk about
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:01.520]   the rumor of apple original podcast next week yeah and although you know apple is still preserving
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:08.400]   that rss feed yes subscription model and we want that to stick around we want marco arment
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:15.360]   with overcast and pocket cast and all the cast all the rss based players to continue yeah but
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.400]   spotify would like everybody to start listening with a spotify app because well it's more money for
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:27.120]   them so um that's an interesting i will admit that i i when amazon started selling more than
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:31.840]   books i was like why are they even bothering me so i so i i'm similar thing so i have a little
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.640]   bit of no margin in that they just bought in a spotify right so if you're a bill uh
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.720]   a simmons fan yeah but you're not a sports guy but you know it's very interesting what they're up
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:49.200]   to so we'll talk about that tomorrow on twig thank you everybody and and subscribe to the rss feed
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:55.280]   keep podcasts alive thank you everybody we'll see you next time now get back to work because break
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:09.520]   time is over
