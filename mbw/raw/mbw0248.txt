[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.120]   The show that covers your Mac news, your Apple News, your iOS
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.560]   news.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.360]   And the host of our show today is not me.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   Because I've been lazy.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.280]   And I allowed Mr. Andy Enocho to do all the work today
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.160]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.400]   And that's your punishment for being lazy.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.040]   You'll wind up with me as the host.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.960]   I think it's great.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.680]   You did a great job last week.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.360]   And you've reassembled our star panel from last week.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.000]   There you go.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.680]   Well done.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.800]   Would you like to introduce our panelists?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   I very much would.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   In alphabetical and non-denominational order.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.720]   First we have Chris Breen from Macworld.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   Host of a fantastic head of hair, for which he gets way, way
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   too much credit.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.720]   Because underneath that hair is almost as important
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.320]   his voluminous knowledge of iOS, music, and everything
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.520]   involving squealy lines and dots on lines that go like this.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.080]   Chris, how is it doing?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   It's great.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.240]   And thank you so much for that fine introduction.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.680]   Already you're outstripping me, Andy.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.720]   Can you tone it down just a bit?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   Oh, don't worry.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.560]   I had my last caffeine about three hours ago.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.040]   It's going to be kind of fun about 53 minutes from now.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.080]   Before we move off Chris, though, is that Steve Jobs press
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.720]   like film and television headshot behind you?
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   Or is that something I don't recognize?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.120]   It's like my own brand, though.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.040]   It's actually Jeffrey Tambor.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.360]   Oh, Jeffrey Tambor.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.880]   All right.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yeah, it's my one autographed celebrity photo of a friend
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.680]   of mine in Hollywood.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   I was doing some tech support for him.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   And he said, I will get you an autographed picture
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   of anybody I said, I want Jeffrey Tambor.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.360]   And I want him to write, hey, now on there because it's
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.160]   a step for the re-standers.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.200]   And sure enough, hey, now there's Jeffrey Tambor above
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.920]   Chaddon Jeremy's The Arc, which was their Sergeant Pepper.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   Wow.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   My head is reeling.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.440]   Chad and Jeremy had a Sergeant Pepper?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.080]   They did.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   Yes, along with a lot of other Gary Lewis and the Playboys
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.080]   had a Sergeant Pepper as well.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.960]   OK, I'll take your word for it.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   Actually, in so much that as Jerry Lewis' son
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.760]   did a whole bunch of drugs and then recorded an album, not
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.360]   in the sense that they recorded an epic shaking album, correct?
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.720]   After getting back from now, he took a lot of drugs.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.800]   And then he did the album.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.920]   So I'll put that one up next time I'm on.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.840]   OK.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.240]   You're off to a great start.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.760]   I should warn you, you probably need another 18 or 19,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.120]   including Eliza Manelli before you have enough photos
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.360]   for a New York deli.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.680]   But excellent start.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.720]   You could not.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.600]   Jeffrey-- I got to applaud Jeffrey Tambor.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.320]   He wasn't a Melbrook.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.560]   He wasn't two Melbrooks movies.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   And the Grins is still Christmas, so we got to applaud that.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.960]   Next, I've got a little order.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.920]   Adam angsts the titan of Mac Electronic Publishing.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.200]   He's killing the newspaper in print industry,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.480]   but saving trees at the same time.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560]   Adam Anks of tidbits and take control ebooks.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.280]   How is it going, Adam?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.760]   It's going fine, Andy.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.640]   Thank you.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.120]   I was checking my hair.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   But when Chris is on, you have no chance.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.720]   I think, Adam, you could have a Twitter account
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.560]   to hear of Adam.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.200]   I think you could.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.120]   I think you could qualify.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.520]   We could start that right now.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.480]   Somebody said for the fact that we all have hair here.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   Well, we don't know what Andy's got.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.520]   He's got a hat.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.280]   Oh, no.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   See, what I've got is a badge haircut.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.760]   The desire not to really do my hair before the show.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.440]   So that's why you realize that it's 2 PM here in the East Coast.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.520]   That's awfully early for me.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.320]   So I really can't.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.480]   I can't be expected to say.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000]   I will not hear that.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.760]   As long as we're talking hair, John's got us all beat.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.160]   I mean, look at his hair.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.200]   Ah, yeah.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.920]   That's a fabulous hair.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.200]   It's a full black hair.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.000]   And the rest of us, oh, boy.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.480]   That's OK.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.760]   I mean, you know, I don't see Leo see this once again.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.600]   You're possibly for not doing repreperation.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.480]   We're about 10 minutes in.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.000]   And pretty much we're just talking about hair care product.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.880]   So when it's for committed, John--
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.320]   Now, let's go all in.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.000]   Condition shampoo and condition.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.760]   Because I've read in Vogue, that's
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.200]   what you're supposed to do for that sort of '60s,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   like ultra sheen sort of thing.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.040]   So I don't like to put a lot of product in my hair afterward.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.720]   So it's always a separate shampoo and conditioner.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.440]   Those two and ones never work.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.200]   Should you shampoo every time you shower
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.960]   or get on a rotation schedule?
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.720]   Because I don't want to strip the Calcumin from the--
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.120]   I have a script.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.720]   I have a Purl script that tells me--
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.480]   Is that open source?
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.520]   Can you put it on Google Cloud?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.880]   I'll give you the link in the show notes.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.760]   Awesome.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.080]   All right, we're off to a minute.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.640]   By the way, John Gruber from during fireball.net.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.720]   Do you have anything not hair related,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160]   like to the state introduced yourself?
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.360]   No, I'm not really.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.680]   You know, Harry--
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   You know how Harry Shura used to do great stuff
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.120]   with the satellite feed.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   They don't do raw feeds anymore of the network news.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.960]   And I think the best thing he ever had
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.240]   was Dan Rather talking to the stylist
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   before he's about to do the CBS Evening News, saying,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.480]   you know, I didn't wash my hair last night.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.600]   And I'm thinking of not washing it again today.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.160]   Does it seem to give it some body?
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.200]   And that really--
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.920]   Gonna set the stage for the show today, I believe.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.760]   Except he did it with a bit more of a settlement S, I believe.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.840]   Yes.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.480]   I don't have enough shine and energy.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.160]   Hey, now.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.840]   Where is Hank Kingsley when we need him?
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.960]   Well, yeah, at least we've got an all over Jeffrey Tambor.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   Yes.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   He's a cue ball.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.480]   True.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   So it'll look you ball.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.800]   Although I hear he's playing Steve Bomber in the movie epic
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   of the Microsoft story.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.200]   Well, it's a lateral mood for men to turn,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.040]   blat, and hairspray.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.800]   You have to admit.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.120]   Yes.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   You're still in a form of drag.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.120]   You're still doing a lot of dancing and jumping up and down.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.080]   Only, at least when he does it on stage,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.720]   it's an age appropriate thing for him to do.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.040]   So--
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.240]   So, well, after all that, I think we should take a commercial break.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.040]   From our good friends at Pantene, you know--
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.240]   Pantene Crow, the active on the ghost, sedentary lifestyle,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.480]   the tech columnist.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.760]   It's easy to neglect your personal hygiene,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.440]   but not so much with your set it, wet it, and forget it line
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.400]   of interglue, pomade, shells.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.520]   If we do, in fact, get Pantene on the network, Andy,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.680]   I think I'm going to have to send you a commission.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.160]   I would enjoy that commission.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.480]   And once again, we realize that things that are aromatic,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.960]   things that are sort of cover up the fact
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   that I do shampoo roughly once every three weeks, shower,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.560]   once a month, if I get that water turned back on,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.880]   and those jerks of the water company,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.520]   we've got a little bit of an issue back and forth.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   But it's going to be--
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.880]   He just needs the shampoo in a can,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.160]   like they used to have in the '60s.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.200]   Yes, that's ST.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.920]   And you just squirt the stuff on your head.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.640]   Brush it out, yeah.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   I don't know if you ever washed it out.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   I think it was just like--
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.120]   I think you brushed it out, don't you?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.280]   You said you're secret, Chris?
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.480]   The '60s?
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.960]   Here I have more than 75 cases of this stuff
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.520]   and nobody else has anymore.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   I know.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   Chris has never brushed it out.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.560]   So what you're really seeing is not hair,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.120]   but an accumulation of pissed.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.200]   Exactly right.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.280]   And it's actually my hair is normally black,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.120]   but it's just been caked on with it stuff.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   And it's turned this color.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.920]   So you're saying that in your bathroom,
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.160]   there's something akin to a cotton candy machine.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.200]   You just dump the--
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.560]   in there, stick your head in there,
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.280]   swish it around a few times to pick up the fibers.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.920]   It's the pissed swirly is what we call it here.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.760]   And you just--
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.080]   been there and you pull the prank and end up--
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.200]   just goes everywhere.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.240]   It's a pissing swirly.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200]   Is anybody watching anymore?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.880]   They just go--
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.080]   That's good.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.800]   This is good now.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.400]   It's a very low pressure show because you're doing it all
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.520]   by yourself.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yes.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.600]   Well, it's very important that we do all this stuff
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.280]   in the first 10 minutes.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.000]   But what we really want to do is we
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   want to scare off all the people who aren't really interested
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.400]   in hearing about Mac news and Mac topics,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   because you've got to be committed at this point
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.040]   to be sticking it through.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.720]   Then you're not going to find out about the new hover car 30
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.640]   minutes into the show if you bailed early.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.480]   We want to shake-- again, I'm under NDA when I was really--
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.800]   I know three of us are under NDA,
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.000]   but you know what NDA stands for?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.320]   Never a damn Apple product.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.720]   Anyway.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.000]   Actually, I think this is the show where we bury the lead.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.080]   We're going to put the hover car.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   Hover car last.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.640]   Or we may not get to it all, because there's
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.200]   a lot of legal stuff we can be talking about.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.760]   And that's way way more interesting than a flying car
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.480]   with a 21 gigawatt laser front mounted.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.120]   So I guess the one big piece of news that we got yesterday
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   was Apple finally came out of the trenches
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.920]   and made their face known in the Lotus lawsuit Kerfuffle,
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.560]   which was about to become a malarkey-us bit of rhubarb.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.480]   Finally, I think a lot of people were waiting for Apple's
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.760]   comment after all these iOS developers
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.080]   start getting hit with these demands for licensing fees
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.680]   for in-app purchase and a subscription to quote technologies
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.560]   have been wired up into their sites and apps.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.280]   But it was really a lot like when that scene--
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.480]   I tweeted this yesterday.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.360]   It was like when that scene in Avatar where that cat laid
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.960]   and said, and what had you?
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   She had you, because that's the Apple finally came out.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.280]   And really, guns are blazing, because I mean,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.840]   would you like to be in a public forum no less attacked
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.920]   with language like this?
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.400]   And this is a letter from Apple to Lotus.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.240]   The time quoting directly.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.440]   We might get the explicit tag.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.600]   So if you've got young ones, cover their ears.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.120]   Climb one also claims a memory that stores the results
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.960]   of the user interaction and a communication element
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.520]   to carry those results to a central location.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   Once again, Apple provides under the infringement
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.120]   theory set out in your letters the physical memory
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   in which the feedback is stored.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.840]   Just as importantly, the APIs that
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.240]   allow transmission of that user feedback to and from the app
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.800]   store over an Apple server using Apple hardware and software
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.880]   indeed in the notice letters to app makers
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.520]   that we have been privy to, Lotus itself relies
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.560]   on screenshots of the app store to purportedly
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.320]   meet this claim element.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.880]   Wow.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.960]   Oh snap.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   He don't know he didn't.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.280]   I mean, God, burn.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.040]   I think burn is another--
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.720]   I haven't synchronized the snapshot.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.520]   Oh, come on, Andy, you're missing the best part,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.080]   though, when he gets into patent exhaustion.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.120]   That's really worth it.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   That's what that's--
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   That's what we need to do.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   I'd say the pictures are not surprised
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.880]   these little bit patent exhausted.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.360]   Anybody over the age of 22 would be a little patent exhausted
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   after that.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.640]   You know what I mean.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.800]   So think--
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.520]   No, I mean, the thing that was kind of interesting--
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.120]   I found interesting about this because I've
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.400]   been talking to some of these developers.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.360]   And some-- we're talking some really small--
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.120]   small fish here, frankly.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.680]   And so with what--
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.240]   Lotus was claiming-- I mean, these guys
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.440]   were-- I mean, they weren't on the edge of being put out
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.320]   of business, but it wasn't much beyond that in terms
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.920]   of how big a hit a legal battle is for a really small company.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.440]   And so for them to have Apple come up and say, you know,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   to lots of us, basically, you're smoking something.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.360]   You have absolutely no right to go around suing our developers.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.880]   And you want to take us on?
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.000]   Come on.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.920]   Let's do it.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.320]   That's really what it came down to.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   So those developers were really, really happy to see Apple coming back.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.320]   I like Dr. Mamunar Chatteram, who said,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.720]   they may be small fish, but you can make a rich stew
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.600]   out of many small fish.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.640]   John, do you really think that this was the company's aim
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.560]   to begin with to bring Apple into the fight?
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.120]   Or do they really think that they'd
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.240]   be able to get $3,000 a hit off of each one of these independent
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.360]   developers enough to, I don't know,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.960]   pay for pizza and beer for whatever little strip mall
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.840]   office they rented?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.440]   It's weird to try to figure out what they were after
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.560]   and if they thought all these legal maneuvers would actually
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.640]   pay off for them.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.760]   That's been my confusion with the whole thing
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.240]   from the beginning, because I would
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.840]   have to say that so far it's played out pretty much exactly
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.680]   as I thought it would.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.360]   I thought we'd get a response pretty much like this from Apple.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.240]   Not right away.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.040]   I think it's the sort of thing that double triple, quadrupled,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.640]   checked everything that they want to say that, yes, we are willing to do this.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.880]   And you'll notice, too, that Apple doesn't really say exactly what
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.160]   they're going to do to protect developers if it keeps going,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.440]   except that just the basic overview, like Adam said, of, you know,
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   for now, if you want to get in this fight, you've got to bring it to us.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.160]   So I think we have to wait and see what LODSIS does or LODSIS, whatever
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.400]   their name is.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.560]   They're definitely LODS.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.840]   And it's exactly like you said, like either A, they were hoping to bleed
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:04.360]   to $3,000 here and there from hundreds, maybe even thousands of independent developers.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.720]   And now their plot is foiled and they'll just go back in their cave and whenever
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.880]   here for them again, or they expect at Apple to do this.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.440]   And we're going to be talking about this for the next two or three years,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.640]   you know, every couple of months as one more salvo is fired as a battle Apple.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.840]   What I find interesting about it is it really was odd.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.560]   Most of the time patent trolls go after the money.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.720]   And so they go after the big guys because even though the big guys have lawyers and
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.000]   are willing to fight, they let us look at it and say, you know, it's not worth us
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.560]   paying our legal team, you know, $2 million and we could pay you $500,000 to make you go away.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   So that was weird.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.480]   But the other thing that I found a little odd about LODSIS is they have four patents.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.520]   I mean, they're kind of a small patent troll when it comes to the troll business.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.200]   And so, you know, I really wonder if they didn't think, you know, our only real
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.400]   chances to go after small fish who will give us a little bit of money and not try to take on
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   take on the big guys.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.880]   But the whole thing really does seem pretty confused because they said themselves,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.520]   Apple has their patents, Apple has licensed their patents.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.840]   And it's pretty clear that once, you know, once you've used a patent,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.520]   once you've embodied it in a product, you can keep going with that.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.400]   And that's what Apple did.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.360]   That is what this whole patent exhaustion concept is about.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.720]   And the Supreme Court ruled on that in 2008 pretty clearly.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.160]   So I'm really not sure what LODSIS could have been thinking.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.200]   And especially because their patent was more specific than a lot of people are thinking.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.560]   It was in-app purchasing, but it was specifically in-app purchasing for upgrades
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.240]   to the exact app.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.560]   So it wasn't subscriptions and it wasn't game levels and things like that.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.360]   So it was just a little odd what they were trying to do.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.720]   And so, you know, we will see if, you know, as I wrote it when I was writing about, you know,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.720]   the ball is very much back in LODSIS's court.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.480]   But I think Apple has said, you know, your beef is with us.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:15.000]   And, you know, we need some meat to throw to Apple legal, the pen down below.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.040]   So go to it.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.640]   Yeah. We haven't had enough.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.280]   I don't think I've seen a really good legal analysis of what this statement from Apple means
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.920]   to developers.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.440]   If I had received one of these letters from LODSIS, I'd now be worrying about, well,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.640]   I now believe that Apple has my back on this and that at some future point, this will all work out.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.120]   But I'm still looking at this letter that says you have x days to respond and at least
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.400]   internal agreement or say that it's going to be a legal fight.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.160]   I'm wondering what the temperature the developer community is right now,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.320]   whether it's time for them to simply tell LODSIS to, you know, go stuff it or whether they still
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.360]   have to retain lawyers.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.720]   They still have to at least gird for battle and prepare for not being able to buy a third boat,
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.840]   which is of course the sort of level as LODSIS know that most iOS developers are in.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.240]   Does anybody have a really good idea of that?
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.720]   Chris, you talked to a lot of iOS people in your career as Mr. iOS.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.960]   I, you know, the sense I got from a lot of people simply from Twitter streams is a massive
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.240]   sense of relief and that nobody sounded like they were going to pursue this with LODSIS.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.280]   Basically, they're going to file this in a way and a drawer somewhere and figure that Apple was
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.480]   going to take care of it.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   And I think this is a tremendous message that Apple is sending to its developers because
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.320]   clearly, you know, even regardless of the problems that some developers have had getting their apps
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.240]   through, this was a nice demonstration of support from Apple that Apple is basically saying to them,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.120]   yes, we really do need you and we're going to, we're going to cover you on exactly this kind of
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.600]   thing. We don't know what this means for the future, but I think for now, Apple is clearly
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.000]   saying not only to LODSIS, but a lots and lots of other patent trolls or people want to come in.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.960]   We have a massive legal team. We have a lot of money. And if you mess with us, we're going to
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.520]   come and hurt you and we're going to hurt you for years to come because we're happy to take on
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.320]   outfits like Google and Nokia and you patent troll are nothing to us.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.200]   You are just beneath our feet and we are not saying you are a
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:19.480]   slave. No, it's the new. Well, the other thing as far as a patent troll goes that was fascinating
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.720]   was was the way LODSIS, you know, after the whole thing broke, started boasting all this stuff on
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:31.080]   their blog about you're being really mean to us. We're not true. We're a patent holding company.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:39.080]   It was that scene after the state senator gets caught in a motel room with three-flight attendants.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:46.680]   Let me set the record straight. I have failing eyesight. And sometimes I need people to read
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.600]   these laws affecting your children to me. And it has really good acoustics at the Belair
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.920]   no-tell, no-tell motor. And that's exactly sex with that woman. Now, I'm sure that we can put
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.400]   this all behind this and I can just start processing these checks coming in right away.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   I just needed a roll of toilet paper. Apple sort of like, you know, zing them a little bit by saying,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.720]   okay, know this line in your own website when you're defending yourself in which you said that we
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   Apple are licensing your technologies. Yeah, you know what? We're glad in our lawyers. We're
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.200]   glad. And we're sure that a judge seeing this case can be glad to see that you admit that we're
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.360]   licensing your technologies. We're going to send you a nice basket of cheeses in lieu of the tens
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.880]   of millions of dollars you thought you were going to get from us as a consolation prize. Thanks for
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.160]   playing the trying to sue a multinational global brand that has about $80 billion in cash.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.480]   Building full of lawyers.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:46.760]   I think it kind of gets to the heart of the didlodzis, did this guy Mark Small,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.880]   who seems to be the only guy, I think, at LODSIS. I mean, he doesn't seem involved.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:58.200]   It's questionable whether the guy whose patents they are still has any kind of stake in the
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:06.520]   matter. I think he kind of claimed to Matt, Matt, hold on, his motto, dug into it.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.600]   And it's unclear whether he's involved at all, but it seems like this guy Mark Small is LODSIS.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:19.400]   And I presume that he is like a patent lawyer or at least some sort of lawyer and was going to
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.280]   whatever the negotiations are he was going to, it's not like he's spending money on lawyers,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   I guess it's his own time. If I had to place a bet, I would think that he just did this on a
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:37.080]   lark or on a flyer and was hoping to get a couple thousand bucks from developer A,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:43.800]   a thousand from developer B here, there, and this constant stream of half of a percent of revenue
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   going forward. And I get the feeling, especially from that blog he wrote, or he called it a blog,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.520]   it seemed weird, but that he was very, very surprised at how public this went instantly,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:05.320]   just by sending out a handful of private message, private FedEx delivered letters to these developers.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:13.000]   Like I don't think he knew what he was getting into in terms of just how big the tech industry
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.800]   press is and how they jump on things like this.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:22.200]   Oh, and you have Apple too, it's not like you're going after some small-time tech company.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.840]   This is Apple. So anything that's connected to Apple is certainly getting in a lot of press.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.120]   And the people who use Apple products, they have a certain loyalty to a lot of these developers.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.040]   So if you go after somebody like Craig Hockenberry, people are going to care about it or James Thompson.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.640]   Right, we know that. I don't think he did. I think he's very surprised.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.680]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.680]   Yeah. I'm doing some.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.120]   There's one other interesting thing with this whole Mark Small Guy,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.240]   which is that it's a little unclear how he got these patents, because he has said there's only
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.080]   four of them. And some stuff I was reading was suggesting that they were temporarily owned by
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.200]   intellectual ventures, which is Nathan Merwald's company, ex-Microsoft Guy.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:12.920]   Yeah. And so that's how Apple light ended up licensing them. And then somehow they then move
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.520]   over to Lonsis. And that's how Mark Small gets them. And so as I would have made.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   Despite his good pedigree as a former CTO of Microsoft, actually, is a little bit of a patent
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.120]   troll himself, I think. A little bit. Well, he's a little venture. He says 30,000 patents.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.360]   Yeah. I'm sorry, patent holding company.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:41.640]   He's a book defender of the rights of inventors. Let's not poison the well.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   Yes. And do it that way. But yeah, I was talking to a bunch of IP guys. They're telling me that
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.320]   it's become a lucrative enough legal business that it is possible if you are a lawyer with a
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.000]   practice that wants to expand to take one of those three-day seminars out of Ramada in,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.800]   in which they will tell you, here is how to make money in patent and suing companies for
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.440]   abusing patents. And there is actually, it's not as bad as the Donald Trump making million
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.040]   dollars in real estate infomercial. But he made it sound as though it really is you receive
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.160]   two colored binders that explain here's how to find patents that are vague enough to be a value.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.960]   Here's how here's people you can hire to try to find companies that might be abusing that
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.720]   patent or at least do a bad enough job that you can scare some people and give you a couple thousand
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.800]   dollars. And here's a spreadsheet that will help you figure out how much is going to cost for you
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.760]   to actually fight the two or three people who aren't going to knuckle under immediately. So,
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.000]   it's almost as if this is turning into a turnkey business that's going to be advertised on basic
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.720]   cable some weekend. All right, we're going to take, I think this will be a good time to take a little
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.920]   break and come back with more. What a great panel Andy Inaco has assembled, the hair of
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:00.040]   Breen, the hair of Gruber, and the hair of angst and the hat of the notco. It's always too bad we
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.240]   couldn't get Trump. I'm sure we can get just the hair.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.320]   He's got something. We're not completely clear what it is. This portion of the show brought to you
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.440]   by our good friends and I know you all know these guys in great, really great gene in the gang
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:23.400]   at Smile Software and their fantastic products for the Mac, especially TextExpander. If you don't
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.760]   use TextExpander, you're really missing out on perhaps the simple, simply the most useful tool
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.280]   on the Mac. It's also on iOS as a matter of fact, although, you know, because of the limitations of
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:41.000]   iOS, it's not quite the same. I love it on the Mac because I do a lot of email boilerplate, let's
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.120]   face it. People ask me the same things frequently. Anytime I see that I'm sending an email out more
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:52.600]   than once, I just select it. I go to my menu and I say, "Make a snippet out of this." It automatically
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.680]   is part of TextExpander. I add an abbreviation and from now on, anytime I want to say that,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.480]   I just type, now, now everybody probably has different ways of doing this. What I do is,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.520]   I take a word, like for instance, if somebody asks me for my shipping address,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   I'll take ship and I'll put an extra S, S-S-H-I-P. Whenever I type S-S-H-I-P and hit space,
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.720]   I love the little pop sound and it fills out my shipping address. It's so fantastic. Email
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.000]   signatures with web addresses. There are probably people who use it for a Twitter. Anytime that
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.240]   you are typing something more than once, TextExpander is incredible. By the way, not just text,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:37.320]   graphic snippets. You can put in actually a graphic signature. The new TextExpander 3 has some really
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:45.560]   nice virtually programmable features. You can actually automatically create snippets with
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:52.680]   variables so that you fill in the variables. You can use tab, return, enter, or escape in your
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:59.000]   snippet now. That's new. That means you can do paragraphs with returns in a
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.640]   minimum and everything. It's completely apo-scriptable and shell-scriptable.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.280]   Now we're talking. I'll tell you, I love the idea that I could use Bash to answer my email.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:16.680]   I haven't done that yet, but someday my Bash script or my Pearl script will answer all my email.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.640]   You guys must... I mean, is there anybody here who doesn't use TextExpander? You can be honest.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.720]   Andy, I can't get anything. He won't use Quicksilver either. I know what your rationale is.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.960]   If I put this on my computer at home and then I use another computer, I'll miss it.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:39.640]   I've seen people who are power users of TextExpander. It's especially... What you
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.560]   didn't mention is that it's especially handy on the iPad because it's a service that so many other
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:51.640]   iPad app developers are taking advantage of. For me, it makes much, much, much, much bigger
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.480]   sense on the iPad where sometimes you turn... No, I guess you don't want to type so much, huh?
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.920]   Well, because it's hard... I type just sort of mutant fast on a regular keyboard.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.680]   So by the time I find that by the time I learn and remember what tags I've attached to everything,
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.200]   I've kind of forgotten about it. But on the iPad, it's kind of a difficulty to bring things up
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.880]   and type things correctly. Sometimes you're not even holding it in such a way for fast typing.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.160]   And in those cases, when I really need to blow through 60, 70 emails in fairly fast order,
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.920]   that's when I'm really glad that I've TextExpander set up on an iPad. Or when I'm running a column,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.720]   I need to basically blow through lots of text really quickly.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.440]   You see, I've got the variables here. If I type D-D-A-T-E, it'll put the date in a format that I
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   specify... I'm sorry about that screen. There we go. In a format I specify. It's a little different
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.400]   on iOS, but it's pretty awesome on iOS. It just depends. Don McAllister did a great screencast,
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:50.760]   which you can see it's smilesoftware.com. Merlin Mann on his Kung Fu grip blog also has a
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:58.440]   great expo-z-a of the new fill functionality in the TextExpander. This new 3.0 is... I didn't
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.920]   think you could make TextExpander any better. They have. It's fantastic. You can check it out
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:14.520]   for free at smilesoftware.com/macbreaksmilesoftware.com/macbreak. It's $34.95 if you want to buy it. It is on
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:21.160]   the App Store. And Leo. If you don't mind me pre-announcing something slightly, I'd also just like to
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:27.640]   note that we're probably a couple of weeks away from TextExpander coming out.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.040]   I love it. I use the tidbits autocorrect library that you made.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.120]   That's fun. Oh man, you guys saved me so much time.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.280]   So I know Adam's a major TextExpander fan. That autocorrect library is part of TextExpander.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.080]   You can have some default libraries and that's that you can add and that's one of them. And I
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:53.000]   absolutely. It's huge. Yeah. That was actually generated for me by a guy named Micah Alpern,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.960]   who was a Princeton student at the time. And he said he was a terrible, terrible typist. He's
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.080]   got 15 years ago now. And we were at Mac Hack talking about it. And I had come up, figured out
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.160]   a neat feature in Eudora that would do this. And he's like, "Oh, I got the library for that."
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.880]   And so, you know, he gave me the library. And we agreed that we would just make it completely
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.160]   public domain. And so I've made sure any kind of place like TextExpander, they have it and they
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.280]   can do it. But it's all sorts of common typos that it just fixes. And unlike the Apple
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:31.480]   feature in Snowlep, it doesn't use the dictionary. So you have to really have a typo. And then it
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.600]   gets you the right correction rather than a word that it thinks you might mean.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.040]   They've added more snippets. There's Accented Words Auto Correct. They have their own autocorrect.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   I use the 10 bits. Although you could, I guess you could use both CSS snippets and HTML code.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.880]   That's nice because, you know, for instance, I don't ever type bracket A, Href equals quote,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:59.320]   quote, bracket space, bracket, slash a bracket. I just type A, I type H-R-E-F, it fills all that in
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.560]   and it puts the cursor right in the middle where I want to put the text. Things like that just
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.040]   make a huge difference. Well, anyway, I don't want to go on and on. Just get it, would you? If you're
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.800]   not, if you're Mac user and you don't have Texas Spanner or if you have an older version of
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   Texas Spanner and you haven't played with three yet, I'm really interested in doing the Apple
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.560]   scripting with it. I think there's just so much power there. Incredible. Texas Spanner,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:27.480]   get it from smile software.com/macbreak. We thank Smiles for such great supporters of everything
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.920]   Apple and Macintosh. You know, jeans always at Mac world Expo. They have parties. They're just
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.840]   great and it's wonderful that they're supporting Mac break. Andy, back to you.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   Fuck your Leo. Yeah. Actually, the next day, the next day I want to get into it, it's sort of like a
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.320]   two prong sort of thing here. This is probably the best statement of support. This thing with
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.560]   loads is where we're off, we're off a lawsuit. So we're off of legal. We've done hair corner,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.160]   we've done lawyer corner and those two who have a certain amount overlap, I think you'll agree.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:01.800]   I got into Harvard law, but again, I lacked the necessary coupon. But it's kind of interesting
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.160]   that all this sort of stuff is going down just a couple of weeks before WWDC. The one that I always
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.800]   thought that the signal that these people at Loses did not know what they're getting into was
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.480]   the fact that they decided to engage in this action two weeks before Apple and every single
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.160]   developer of iOS were going to be in the same room together and able to have a million conversations
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.520]   with absolutely no email trail or paper trail. That's really, that's not using the old noodle
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   pretty much. But it really does, it's rare that that developers seem to get such a clear statement
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.120]   from Apple that we're on your side on something. I mean, historically, well before Mr. Jobs came
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:45.800]   back, it's always been developers always felt as though Apple is here to block us, to defeat us,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.120]   to make things more difficult to us and to force and to abuse us. Now I feel as though
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.760]   they're that's no longer the case. I believe that developers now feel that Apple is here
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.840]   to abuse us, to be mean to us, to ignore us, to make things more difficult to force.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.880]   But they also are here to make us money, so now it's suddenly okay.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:08.840]   So what the conversations are going to be about at WWDC is kind of an open question.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.320]   But the second thing is that what are they going to be talking about it? Have we ever been so close
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.200]   to a WWDC without any real indication of what they're going to talk about? They still haven't
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.600]   announced a public keynote, something that like, you know, non-developers, not people who haven't
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:28.360]   spent too grand like me can't attend. So I'm going to start off, I think, with John on this one,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   John, what do you think? What's a relationship like? And what's WWDC going to be like? What is what
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.440]   costume is whoever's the poor sap who does the keynote? What's he going to have to come up with
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.160]   for the first day keynote if there is one? >> Well, I think there'll definitely be a keynote.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:48.600]   The question is, will it be Steve Jobs, or will it be, I would guess Phil Schiller,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.040]   who filled in the last time Jobs was unavailable? >> Of course not, of course, Paul.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.160]   >> Or Tim Coker. >> Well, but either way,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.760]   either way, no matter who's the host, I predict, though, the more typical keynote formula now,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.400]   where it's sort of like there's a host of the show who brings up, you know, it's like being
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:14.280]   the host of the Labor Day telethon. You know, here comes Frank Sinatra, here comes, you know.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.760]   >> I wonder if I'm being wheeled on Phil Schiller. And I know that Jerry Lewis is not going to be
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.160]   doing the Labor Day telethon. >> Right, right. Yeah. So, you know, here comes,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.400]   here comes forced all to talk about iOS 5. Here comes, you know, somebody else to talk about this.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   But I do agree with your larger point, though, where in the broad sense, really,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:41.080]   there's almost nothing. It's this vacuum of information. I mean, the iCloud thing,
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.840]   everybody acts like, well, we know they're going to talk about iCloud, but that's just because
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:53.880]   somebody got it on the record that Apple bought the domain name. But nobody knows anything about
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.040]   what it does. I mean, we have ideas. Everybody has their wishes of what they hope it does.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.640]   And I guess we know a little bit about the music stuff, where there's been enough stuff that's
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:09.480]   leaked, presumably, from the music labels, and that Apple has been, unlike Amazon and Google,
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   who've gone for this cloud-based storage without procuring any additional licenses from the music
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:24.200]   labels that Apple is actively negotiating with them to expressly permit online storage of music
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.640]   that you own. >> But is WWDC the place to announce such a consumer-focused product, really?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:35.880]   >> Sort of. >> Sort of. And it has been. I mean, that's why they've traditionally done the
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.480]   hardware announcements there, is that it's not developer. I mean, the keynote often isn't very
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:48.280]   developer- >> That's true. >> And in fact, most years, there's effectively a second keynote after
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:55.160]   the keynote, which is like 10 a.m., there's the keynote. And it goes from 10 to 11.30 or noon,
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.600]   and then there's a break, and you can go get something to eat, and you come back, and at like
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:05.000]   one or 130, in the old days, it used to always be called the Mac OS 10 State of the Union. But
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.880]   that's when Mac OS 10 was the only thing that they had at WWDC. But it was effectively the
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:19.240]   technical keynote. It is okay. The fake developers were all gone, the press is gone. Nobody's here
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.320]   now except paying developers. Here's the technical lowdown on that. >> Now we can tell you the truth.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   >> Right. And then you get- >> And let's talk EPI's.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.720]   >> Right. That's when you get slides that have source code up on this thing.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.360]   So I think it's always been like that. And it's because this is the only time of the year now that
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:42.120]   Apple has a public keynote, now that they've dropped out of Mac World Expo. This is the one time
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:49.880]   per year where somebody from Apple is going to get up in front of 4,500 live, very excited attendees
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:56.360]   who are going to be very loud and give this sort of- I don't think it's hyperbolic to describe it
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.640]   as almost a rock concert like atmosphere. They don't have that anymore anywhere else because when they
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.760]   do these other special events, like when the iPad came out, the fall thing in the music, it's
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:12.520]   a much smaller room filled with press. And the press claps, but it's sort of a polite clapping.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:20.360]   I mean, it's not- >> It's actually thinking about things and not simply being religious in their
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.840]   attitude and their reactions to this. >> Well, and the other thing too that I noticed this-
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.320]   because I don't do live blogging at Daring Fireball. So I go to these things and I don't-
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.880]   >> You actually like to think about what you're going to write.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.960]   >> You're not- >> Here's your mistake.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.760]   >> And well, I'm not a good typist. I couldn't keep up. By the time I got done typing up a
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   sentence, I'd missed something. And I've seen some of these other guys who are so good at it,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.040]   like Jason Smell from Mac World. He typed so fast. I mean, I can't believe it.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.960]   But I look around the press room at those things and almost everybody's live blogging.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.360]   So the applause is actually, I think it's gotten a little bit lower because everybody's too busy.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.320]   >> Typing.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.120]   >> You're so- >> If he says something good,
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   you hear a sudden, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   >> So it might actually be an Apple's best interest to do it like the state of the
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.680]   actual state of the union where the press gets the entire speech like 10 minutes beforehand.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.520]   We can load it into our own version of a teleprompter where line by line, it gets live
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.640]   blogged from our accounts. Meanwhile, we can, we'll have our friends free to applaud and also
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.960]   take illegal pictures that we will also be live blogging.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.320]   >> If they would only stream the damn thing, then everybody wouldn't have to live blog it.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.640]   That is interesting.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.440]   >> It did a lot.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.760]   >> Google does that with all of their tech emails, most of their events. I'm wondering why
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.320]   Apple's now, they certainly can't say that they don't have the technology to stream.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.360]   >> Well, they did it. Well, they did it. The one before last.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.920]   >> Right. So they actually, and a lot of people were there live blogging with, oh,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.240]   so it will be commentary now. And actually, I preferred that. I like having people not have to
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.160]   say, and then this and then this, but instead they could sit and think about it for a couple
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.920]   of minutes and say, I think this is what this means and give you much better insight into what's
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.320]   actually happening instead of trying to step pictures without Apple PR coming over and slapping
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.280]   it in the back of the head and then posting those and posting what's happening without the
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.880]   benefit of anybody jumping in and saying, well, we'll back up. This is important because of this.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.640]   Sure, you get a chance to do that later, but I like that seeing that in the stream as well.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.120]   >> Well, and I think what the live blogging is doing is it's putting a lie to the whole
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.920]   fact that this is some kind of private event that only the press gets to go to. With the live
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:35.160]   blogging, everyone in the world can basically get the live transcript. And so I think Apple would
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.240]   actually be better off to webcast the whole thing, let everyone watch for real. And that way,
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.760]   they're saying what they want to say. And it's not going through this filter of what Jason and Dan
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.960]   Morin can type really quickly or what Jason Jackie Chang and Clint can get pictures of. I mean,
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.720]   I watch these things when they come out because I often don't fly to the west coast just to be
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.240]   at an hour and a half talk. And yeah, they're useful, but I really far preferred it when Apple
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.600]   just webcast the whole thing. >> Yeah, I mean, I'm very much on the fence about whether I'm even
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.360]   going to be going to WWDC this year, chiefly because there are things I need as a journalist,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.800]   there's things I need to get that I can only get there live at the event to justify my spending
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.040]   a thousand bucks to fly out there and be in a hotel for a couple of nights. And right now,
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.200]   I'm not convinced that I'm going to get those things that I will not be getting simply by reading
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.960]   other people's live blogs, talking to PR people afterwards, talking to developers, I know who
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.360]   are going to be there because I don't have to live blog. It's just something that I do because
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.480]   otherwise I'm just sitting in my living room in my pajamas at 2 p.m. East Coast time for absolutely
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.320]   no reason. This way, I can at least say that I'm doing something tax deductible that I can get paid
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:52.760]   for. But it's interesting that we have these events that Apple will simply drop on the media
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.800]   on basically one week's notice without any real idea of here's what you will be getting if you
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.000]   spend your newspaper or your website, so your TV stations, travel budget to fly out here. It's
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.600]   really difficult for those of us on the East Coast to make those decisions time and time again.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.960]   Yeah, but this is historic. Apple doesn't care. They don't have to get the coverage.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.920]   So wait, for Christ's sake, we spent 10 hours talking about an update on the Apple store.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.360]   Well, so where would be where would be on the totem pole? So we know that
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.480]   customers are supposed to be up here. Now, developers in the media have to jockey for number two and
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.440]   number three position. Oh, no, there's no question where we are.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.360]   I'm going to say, I think you're real.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:42.040]   See, on the other hand, it's not as though I can write something, but then I have to submit it for
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:48.760]   approval through Apple say, yes, we will allow you to write to publish this iPad to say, okay,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.560]   instead, like their relation with developers is it's often like one of those prices, right? Games
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   where you frenetically do all this work, then you pull the lever, you see a big red X,
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.160]   a buzzer sounds, they will not tell you what's wrong with the price you chose, but you're a
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.560]   lot to go back and change it and pull the lever again. So on that basis, maybe I'd rather be a
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:11.000]   journalist than an iOS developer. Yeah, we don't have to get Apple approval of everything.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.400]   So what are we? So what are we? So what are we? So what are we? So what are we? So what are we?
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.280]   Yeah, that's, you're a maverick. You're unbroken. You're untamed.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.800]   If there is an enemy's list in Steve Jobs office, I want to be on it.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.960]   You have been audited by Apple, the Apple iTunes store for reasons that you can never
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.240]   understand, but you absolutely can. I see I get the feeling that everybody is on Steve Jobs'
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:44.520]   enemy list. It's just a matter of how late. If anybody is not on Steve Jobs' enemy list,
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:50.920]   John Gruber, it is you. I think I even said he invoked your name, John.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.040]   One time, where he was, I got it. One dirty right.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:42:00.280]   Was vaguely vaguely right. I still think that bottom line, he probably thinks I'm a total jerk.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.000]   Well, if he doesn't like you, I don't know who he is. I think I go ahead. I'm sorry, John.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.080]   I didn't wrap it. I just think that I'm lower on the bozo list than many others.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:15.000]   Yeah. Okay. I think that's exactly right. What people tend to ignore is that,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.120]   especially people, especially journalists, we, and this is not a bad thing. It's not,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.600]   if you let yourself think that Apple loves you or Apple does not love you,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.920]   you stop being of any use whatsoever to the readers and to the users.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:35.720]   That's not the issue. They're just times when your audience is extremely useful to Apple at
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:42.280]   this specific moment. Also, I think I can certainly praise John in saying that he is demonstrated
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   to Apple that he's not going to be one of those bozos who, if you're entrusted with
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.720]   pre-release product, he's not going to go to a bar and try to pick up, "Hey, babe,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.800]   you heard about that new iPad too? I'll get you as when."
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:02.440]   Look how easily the new speech to text can do something like capture your phone number and
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.640]   your address. It's unlike say, "line previews," which are everywhere now.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:15.160]   Yeah, but doesn't Apple sort of understand that they can't really control what happens to a
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.880]   developer preview after you put in the hands of 3,000 people?
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:24.440]   Who's only proof of trustworthiness is that I can find $100.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.080]   Yeah, but the irritating thing is, is those people who do honor their NDAs
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.560]   are sitting here going, "Well, can't talk about it. Sorry, I can't talk about it."
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.520]   And everyone who wants to blow off an NDA is publishing screenshots and everything left to right.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.920]   Thank goodness for them, because most NDAs, I don't sign NDAs, but you guys tell me,
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.520]   most NDAs say, "Once it's public knowledge, you can talk about it."
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.520]   So thank goodness for these guys who blow their NDAs, because then we can write about it, right?
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.640]   I mean, I don't sign NDAs, so I'm always in the clear, because that way I can talk about it.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:02.120]   It's still a little questionable, because yes, it's a question of public knowledge,
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.200]   but as a journalist, you can usually say that you're writing about an event,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.040]   but nonetheless, it's not something you wish to necessarily get into with Apple legal if you
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   can avoid it. And again, if you've signed NDAs, say, "Hey, I'm not going to talk about this,"
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:21.400]   usually you're not going to talk about it until it's public, and Apple didn't make it public,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.000]   someone else leaked it. So yeah, it just feels a little sleazy sometimes.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.480]   Yeah, you really have to understand what the intent of the NDA is. And while if I'm on a live
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.840]   podcast, someone asked me a question about pre-release developer-only software, that...
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.480]   No idea, we do that.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.000]   That's why I've asked her the Wonder Silence dog.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.120]   Yes, you get an answer. You get a question. Well, we're live. You get a...
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:50.920]   One thing to say, well, I read on Apple Insider that there is a new system for doing this.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.720]   It's another thing for me to write a column saying, "Here's an advanced peak based on screenshots
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:01.640]   I found online, because clearly I'm trying to just get around an NDA." And really, an NDA is
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.520]   a bond of trust that you are free to enter into or to reject, but if you enter into it,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.560]   you've promised some person that you're not going to make them look like an idiot to their boss.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.960]   And that's really the... That's the crux of it for me.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:18.600]   I think that the lion situation shows the priorities of Apple as a whole. So they've got two
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:25.400]   new major OS updates that are coming out. I would guess both this year. There's Lion from
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.880]   macOS 10, and then there's iOS 5. So Lion, there's a developer preview that's been out for months,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.600]   and they even have a little promotional site on Apple.com where they show you some of the
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:42.520]   features that are in Lion. And they've changed much. A whole bunch of little things have changed
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.160]   between now and then and people who pay attention to the sites that every time there's a new update
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.960]   and they publish all the new screenshots of what's new, 15 minutes after Apple makes it available,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:46:01.160]   you can see it all. Now, iOS 5 has not been seeded outside Apple. And it's apparently...
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.520]   I mean, I haven't seen anything on any of the rumor sites or the sites that would post even
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:15.160]   sketchily sourced screenshots. Whatever's going on with iOS 5 is locked tight. And presumably,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:22.600]   developers need to know what's coming out just as much as they do with Lion. But Apple knows that
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.000]   if they seeded it, that it would leak. And then the other thing that I think is interesting
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:34.120]   about that is the last two years, three years, maybe even three years, 2008, 2009 and 2010,
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:40.920]   Apple had an event in March or so where they had on campus. And it was like a preview of the
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:47.320]   next version of iOS. And here's a handful of developers. Here's a guy from EA who's going to
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.640]   show you a game that uses these new OpenGL things. And here's somebody else who's going to show you
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.680]   this new thing. We've had him here on campus for two weeks. And this is what they cranked out in
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:04.840]   two weeks. They didn't do that this year. I think that's a good feeling to heat from Android.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.920]   Yeah, they don't want to tip their hands on iOS 5 such that their features can be newer
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:16.680]   without other people copying them as much. But does Apple tend to do a lot of features that
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:29.960]   can be easily copied? Steve Ballmer, again, at the Ed to Turdblan of the tech CEO industry,
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:37.160]   was on a big stage showing what the next version of the Windows Phone OS is going to be. And it
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.760]   has a lot of really nice things. But most of them are, oh, speech to text. Okay, let's do that.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.600]   Or, okay, support for Twitter. I think we can put that in iOS if we want. Whereas Apple tends
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.640]   to say, well, how do you copy AirPlay in such a way that it looks anything like the way that AirPlay
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.880]   works, for instance? Well, you could talk to Google about that in their new music service,
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:03.480]   because I think largely it was half an hour of them going through, well, and we took this from
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.960]   iTunes, but we changed that name. And we took this and we're not calling it genius, but we're
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:15.560]   saying it's ingenious. And here's feature X, Y, and Z that all came directly from iTunes. And yet,
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.200]   they just renamed them and see like, is it this fantastic? It was great in iTunes three years ago,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.560]   and it's maybe it'll work on your platform as well. Yeah, I thought that was curious too. Now,
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.680]   actually, let's talk a little bit about iCloud, if we could, before you do.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.760]   Let's take a break. Speaking of the cloud. Let's let's let's let's let's thank a sponsor before
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.400]   you thank a sponsor. And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. Eddie,
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:42.520]   Anako is here with Chris Breen, the Mac Daddy from Mac world magazine Mac world.com. Adam
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.400]   Anks from tidbits.com, who really is the Mac Daddy, I think he's been writing about the Mac
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.600]   longer than almost anybody. I wrote my first article about the Mac in 1984 for bite. So that
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.720]   might qualify me. I think you're earlier there, but I'm publishing my own thing longer than anyone
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.640]   else. There you go. You got to get everybody's got everyone little niche, you know, I was like,
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.440]   well, if you slice and dice it this way, I look really good. Get a niche.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.320]   I am the only guy who sits on a blue ball and talks about the Macintosh. How about that?
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:19.720]   Oh, go there. I just let you say that already did. Let's let's talk a little bit about
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:25.640]   hover. Hover is a great domain name register. You might say, well, why do I need to change
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.200]   my domain name register? Well, if you say that, then you probably don't really use your domain
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.400]   name register. Because if you do use most of these guys, you'll know what a pain it is with all the
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.840]   clicks and the upsell and the difficulty in managing your stuff and just the junk on the page,
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:48.360]   it makes it very hard to use. Hover is very simple. In fact, that's their kind of tagline domain
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:54.760]   name registration made simple. It's they don't sell a lot of additional features. They just give
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.160]   you what you want, which is you come up with a name, you go to the hover site. In fact, if you do,
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:05.720]   please go to Macbreak.hover.com and you register the domain name and a couple of clicks later,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:13.720]   you're done. They do do a few additional things. They also will do email forwarding for you domain,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.960]   forwarding those kinds of things. They do build in domain name privacy, who is privacy automatically.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:27.640]   So they're not going to upsell you on that. They do support all the major TLDs.com.net.org.biz.info
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:35.880]   and if you unusualones.co.ca.us.cc, there's.tv.bz.me.me.to. Anyway, go there and you'll find out. There's
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:43.240]   it's all there. And I love this feature. The Transfer Concierge Service. If you, like me,
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:48.680]   have a whole bunch of domain names, Hover will as because you're a member of the Macbreak weekly
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:54.760]   audience, they will offer you a free domain transfer service. Now, normally this is $25.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.480]   You click that transfer your domain thing and you'll see and that's still a pretty good deal
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.360]   for you. A thousand domains or a hundred domains, $25. But they're going to waive that fee for those
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.880]   of you who are listening to this show. That's nice. It is $10 for each domain you transfer,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:15.320]   but that $10 extends the domain for one full year. So that's a very good deal.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:23.320]   And you'll get 10% off by going to Macbreak.hover.com. So I've got three deals for you. Hover is so
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.120]   great. These from the folks at Tukaz, you might remember them as domains direct. They've rebranded
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:34.280]   and I think solved a lot of problems by just making it as simple as can be. We any time I now,
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:40.520]   I need to do a domain name registration. I just go to Macbreak.hover.com and it's a couple of clicks
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.600]   in the mouse and I'm in and out and I love it. Great domain management tools as well. If you
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:51.960]   don't have a web page, this is a good way to start. Even more importantly, if you're still using,
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:58.440]   you know, at gmail.com or at AOL.com or at Yahoo.com as your email address, you'll look a whole lot
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.560]   more professional if you have a custom domain name. They could still end up at Gmail or AOL or
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:10.600]   Yahoo. But people will email you at your custom domain, you know, Leo@leoville.com. And well,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:16.840]   that doesn't very professional actually. But Leo@tuit.tv. There you go. That's also registered through
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:23.400]   hovered.com. And also the advantage is if I change internet email providers, I don't have to change
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.880]   my address. I just change the forwarding and hover and it automatically goes to my new provider.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:34.920]   That's nice too. So your last email address for the rest of your life, get it at macbreak.hover.com.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:41.320]   They also have a, we will never put you on hold service. They guarantee if you call during business
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.480]   hours, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, you will not be put on hold. They will
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.680]   solve your problem. And I get so many tweets from people all the time. I say,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:55.160]   hover had the best service. They really, you know, solve my problem. They fix the issue.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:00.680]   They're great. Macbreak.hover.com. Give them a try today and we thank you for their support
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:08.600]   of Mac Break Weekly. And of personal testimonial, I had three domains at debtelephants.com.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.480]   And I transferred those over to hover using this very deal and it worked out.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.200]   Thank you. Really easy to do. Yeah, we've transferred all.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.480]   We know we're going to go to die.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.840]   You want to. They're too big to live.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:26.200]   Look at Mr. Bigshot at geocities.com web pages and isn't good enough for you.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:33.320]   Fine. Fine. You know, me and you world are doing just fine. Thank you very much.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.680]   You know, I've been using the Google music service because I went to Google I/O and I got the
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   the invite for some time. You know, it has some advantages say over Amazon service. For instance,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.520]   I can upload 20,000 songs, but I have to upload each and every one of them. I've got about 8,000
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.640]   songs on there right now. What's nice though is they show up on all my Google devices without
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:59.320]   having to download them. They stream. But Google is missing a big piece of what Apple presumably
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:05.480]   would bring to the table, which is sales. They don't sell music. It's weird. It seems, I got it
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:11.080]   about a week ago myself and it took about five days for my music library. Just the subset of
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.520]   the song my MacBook to upload. I know that's 5,000 songs, but it shouldn't take that many days
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.880]   for that many for that little amount of data to upload. And the thing that it seems like a really,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:28.040]   really great thing if you are using an Android phone and an Android tablet because it really is
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:33.400]   pretty cool when you don't even have to think about syncing because all of your music is available.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.360]   And if there's something you like enough that you want to be able to listen to it on the plane,
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   you tap a button and immediately caches. But it's kind of it really does seem like a half-butted
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.960]   solution because here I've now I've gone and uploaded 5,000 songs into my library.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:52.120]   I'm thinking that, well, great. That's a great advantage because if my laptop is stolen, I don't
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.680]   have a backup. I backed up my entire library. No, you can't even read download your own music
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.320]   back into the devices that you actually own.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.440]   But do you blame Google for that or does that have more to do with the record companies?
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.040]   No, it's the record companies. Well, yeah, it's the record companies, but Amazon is perfectly fine
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.240]   with letting you read download stuff there. Because it's, well, you're right.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:17.000]   We need these big, what I love about big 800 pound gorilla companies like Google and Amazon
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.920]   and Apple is that they have the ability to, they can't really be pushed around. Amazon can say,
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.400]   we have lawyers, our lawyers have told us that if someone, if a record company tries to sue us,
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.800]   we can tell them that we're just doing network storage and wherever someone uploads to our service,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.200]   they're also entitled to download. If you want to fight us on that, please keep in mind that our CEO
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:42.360]   has enough money to buy his own space fleet. And that is a fact. And consider that before you try
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:47.400]   to sue us and we're moving a feature that makes our product more useful. So I mean, it's just,
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:54.200]   the Google music, it's interesting. It's nice for Android users, but it's just lacking in so many
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:56:00.440]   ways. It's just a very boring product. So I think Amazon is a lot like Apple in certain ways.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:05.480]   And one of them is that I think when Amazon launches something new, they like to have a very
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:11.880]   concise story to go with it. Like, what is the Kindle hardware? It is a reader, right? It is a
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:17.000]   thing for reading. That is what you do. It's not anything else, just a reader. That's their story
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.720]   for it. And it is, it is, and to aid in that, they, it is also very easy to buy new things to read
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:33.480]   right on the device. That's the story. Their music service has a, the story is it's just like a USB
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:40.120]   thumb drive, except it's over the internet, right? It's a storage locker. It is storage just like a
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:45.720]   thumb drive. And instead of being something you plug in physically, it is something you need
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:52.520]   an internet connection for. And that's it. And so that's their explanation for why can you
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:58.200]   download this stuff you've already uploaded because it's just like a USB drive. And it makes sense to
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:04.920]   a user. It's very clear. It makes sense to users. It's also kind of lame. Well, I don't know. I
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:12.360]   disagree. Hey, I got something. This morning, Lady Gaga put her new album on sale on Amazon for
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:17.640]   99 cents. And the demand was so actually yesterday, right? And the demand was so huge that Amazon
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.960]   servers could barely keep up with all the downloads. I think a lot of people using Amazon's cloud
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.640]   servers, I didn't have to download it. It was already on the service. I can play it from the service.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:33.240]   Apple was offering Lady Gaga's, what is it? Born this way? Born this way? Yeah, for $11.96.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:38.840]   99 cents on Amazon. I'm sure Amazon's taking the loss. They're not Lady Gaga. But that's huge.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:44.440]   Yeah. Amazon has done a very, very Apple sort of answer to this where they're providing a really
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:51.320]   nice integrated solution. Apple and the iTunes store and the Amazon MP3 store have been in a
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:56.040]   constant fight for my favors for the past couple of years. I keep waffling between one of the other
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.080]   for my digital music purchases. And what has gotten me to buy a lot more music on Amazon now is the
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:06.280]   knowledge that if I do the one click album purchase and I buy this as an Amazon MP3 album,
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.520]   not only will it automatically go into my iTunes library, just like if I purchase it via the
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:16.200]   iTunes store, but a second copy of this album will also automatically be added to my cloud storage
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.400]   on Amazon where I can not only access it from really any device on the planet, but also it means
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.120]   that all my purchases are being backed up for me. I don't have to contact technical support and say,
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.680]   hi, yeah, I accidentally set my Mac book on fire and I haven't backed up in three months. Can you
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.280]   please let me redownload the stuff that I already purchased? I don't even have to do that because
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:40.840]   it's already there. So at least they're adding something other than your reward for five days
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.400]   worth of uploading in which you can't really use your network because it's being choked with bandwidth
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:51.960]   is that you get to not have to spend 10 minutes producing a smart playlist in iTunes. So this is
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.880]   my question. I mean, I think the Amazon service is pretty compelling. They had kind of a coming of
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:02.200]   age moment today with Lady Gaga. What is Apple going to do with iCloud to compete? They have to have
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.960]   an active locker instead of a passive one. And that's that mean it's what that means.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:15.400]   So passive locker is where you either you as a user have to upload all your stuff. So it
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.960]   demonstrates that you own it. So if I can if I have it on my computer, I upload it to the cloud,
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:25.800]   therefore I own the stuff regardless of where I got it initially. In the case of Amazon, they have
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:32.040]   to go through this sort of goofy Gavat in order to you've purchased it there and they take an
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:37.880]   additional copy and they put it on their server so that presumably if the RIA comes over and says,
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:44.520]   we want to see Chris Breen's copy of, you know, Dazed and Confused. Oh, certainly. Let's just open
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.920]   this locker here and here it is. And look, it's got his name on it. It shows that we have that.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.320]   But you said the words the RIA that I mean, that's what they're that's why they do it.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.560]   Does that's why the colonies not to have to do that? So the idea with an
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.440]   adhesive locker is that basically you set up a you simply send them a database like the genius
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.960]   feature and iTunes of what you own. And then you say, look, I own this or Apple has a record of
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.400]   everything I've purchased and says, okay, well, we already know he owns it. We're not
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.480]   not going to make him go through the trouble of uploading it or actually put another copy in here.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.320]   We'll just go from the database. He owns it. We'll stream it from our server bang
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:26.760]   done. So no uploading, no ring roll on Apple's end. Simply just say, this is what you own. We
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.920]   know you own it because you gave us money for it. And that should be good enough for you. RIA. And
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:36.360]   at this point, that's I think why Apple is negotiating with record companies. Unlike
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.400]   Amazon and Google who did not, Apple's going to them because Apple has some cloud in this business
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:47.240]   and Amazon clearly does as well. But I think that Apple has a little more cloud so that they
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:52.280]   can go to the record companies and say, we really want to make an active locker. What do you need
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.760]   from us in order to do that? And maybe their answer is a little more money. Maybe we want
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:03.160]   you to highlight more of these artists something. They got variable pricing from Apple for a different
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.480]   kind of deal. So I'm sure the record companies have a laundry list of stuff that they want.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.520]   Apple now is going to go to them and say, okay, let's look at your list. This is what we want in
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.720]   return. We'd like to have an active locker so that our customers can get the stuff they purchase from
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:23.720]   us. Ideally, that would be video too. But with with broadband caps, that gets very tricky.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.840]   What do you think about subscription though? I mean, that's the other thing that gets interesting
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.600]   once you have an active locker is that you can say, let me download all this stuff, which I have
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:41.160]   paid you some amount per month for, and then take it away when I stop paying you because you control
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.920]   my locker. I love subscription. I'm the one guy maybe an entire back to universe. Okay,
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.480]   too. Okay, both of us lost subscription. And everybody else says, well, I don't want to
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.680]   rent my music because Apple said I shouldn't. But if you're a music geek, and you're the kind
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   of person who likes to go to new restaurants just to try a different style of food and not eat the
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:07.320]   same stuff day after day, subscription is wonderful because you could have access to 11 million tracks.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.960]   And so if I want to explore the entire works of John Coltrane and every
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.600]   Sideman in the band, I can do that. But that isn't the way a lot of people listen to music.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.400]   Well, but I actually argue with you slightly that I'm the reverse. I buy very little new music.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.320]   And the reason is, is that I don't want to buy anything unless I know I'm going to like it.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.240]   No, you're just an old fart. Just face it.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.720]   I'm cheap too.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.080]   So what the fact is, is that if I could just listen to stuff and that's when I find a site,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.920]   I found this amazing site called Day Trotter recently where they, I don't know you understand
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.440]   it yet, but they've got a lot of music you can listen to for free and even download for free.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:56.360]   And indie bands usually. And I just really like it because it's easy. I don't have to think about
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.240]   whether or not it has value to me. I can just listen to it. And if it does later, I can go and
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.840]   do something more. But that's why I like subscription services. I use MOG,
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.480]   Artio, and they're great for discovery because I've paid for everything they've got. I actually
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.560]   use MOG because they have the largest database and highest quality. And that's a great way to
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.040]   discover new music. They're not indie artists. They're, I almost said real artists.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.200]   They're meat, they're not wearing artists. I completely agree with you. I think it's a
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.720]   tremendous way to discover new music. And particularly when you have tie-ins to devices like Sonos,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.640]   which I know Leo, you've got so just added MOG and it's fantastic.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.840]   It's fantastic. And Squeeze Box supports these things too. Plus being able to,
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.040]   they have iOS apps to do it so you can stream to those as well as download because as long as
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.200]   you continue paying, you get to download the stuff at huge bit rates, but still great access. But I
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:56.040]   think it's a tough sell for most people. And I think that the record companies really like
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.880]   subscriptions. They make good money on this stuff. The artists don't, but the record companies do.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.720]   But I think Apple is going to shy away from it because they like that iTunes model. They like
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.080]   you buying stuff from them. And I don't know if subscription makes financial sense to them.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.680]   They're doing quite well as they are now.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.600]   All right. People clearly get the iTunes music store because it's, I forget how many
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:26.520]   it's literally billions of songs sold. Yeah, but it also was the first good music store.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.920]   And I think I wonder now that there is competition. I'd so clever to have the 99 cent Gaga thing
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.640]   because what you get is a lot of people who would never even think of buying music from Amazon
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.840]   trying it once. They've got the downloader now. If it's a good experience for them,
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.160]   they like the Cloud Locker. All of a sudden, that's a bunch of people you can move over
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.560]   because now there's competition. There wasn't John. There was no competition for so long.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.200]   I think Amazon's music service is great. I think it's, you know,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.280]   and for a long time we debated on this show. Alex Lindsey always said, oh, it's too hard to use.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.200]   It's too hard to use. And I'm not sure that's, I think when you install one free app that
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.600]   Amazon automatically suggests to you when you buy a song and it will, if you have this app installed,
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.800]   automatically everything you download from Amazon MP3 will be installed in the
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.880]   iTunes. So it really is really is very seamless. But I think that one of the things that aren't,
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.800]   that isn't being discussed is sometimes it's the really low tech, simple, stupid,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.520]   traditional marketing things that work really great. Amazon is doing a whole month worth of
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.240]   stuff where they have nearly 2000 albums that are available for five bucks each.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.720]   And we're not talking about, you know, the guy from Simply Red who did a solo album,
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.080]   the second solo album. Wait a minute. That's a good album.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.600]   He'll be, he'll be cleaning your pool later on, I think. But these are like great albums.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.680]   Like I'm like, okay, let's look at, okay, I don't care about that. Holy cow, like 32 Ray Charles.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:57.160]   Okay. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I've always wanted to get cold. Okay. Bye. Bye. I'm 35 dollars in.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.200]   And I've only on like page three of these. Amazon's brilliant. You know, I check the app store
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.320]   every day for the Android free app of the day. They've got me going there now in a habit
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.640]   every single morning. I go to the Amazon MP three store every single morning to see what the new
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:20.360]   free or cheap. They're very smart. Do not do not skinner would be pro. Yeah.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   They got a little skinner box there. And it's all, you know, and one click and everything.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:30.520]   Please. I'm sorry. Anyone interrupt you. I just think they're doing a good job.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:35.480]   Adam's right. They're sure just for like one day, maybe April Fool's day. I think every single
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.240]   buy it now button should simply be relabeled shot of endorphins.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.960]   administer administer. Oh, that's the stuff administer.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.960]   I also think that with Amazon with their incredible discounts on these things. And I'm the same way
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.880]   where a lot of times somebody will just Twitter, Hey, I, you know, Ray Charles is a great example
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:59.560]   where it's like or Frank Sinatra. Like here's this great Sinatra album from 61. Amazon's got it
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.040]   for $3.99 or something like that. And it's just so stupid cheap that you're like, well, I've got
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.200]   to buy it. Right. You're not talking 99 cents for a song. When you're talking like three bucks,
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:15.400]   four bucks or five bucks for a whole album, it really is like, you know, it's the point that
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.800]   what do they call the stuff at the checkout counter impulse buy? Right. And yeah,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.680]   I can't get any track for the items. You got to buy the whole box.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.080]   Right. And I can't help but think that it's good. It's good for a lot of these back catalog
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.160]   artists that it can generate a lot of money that they wouldn't have had otherwise.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.600]   Now I presume Amazon's the one losing money on this. I know on the apps, what they do is they
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:48.120]   they decide which one's free and then they pay the app developer. I think it's 20% of the total of
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.640]   the full sale price just to allow them to sell it for free. But Amazon's got to be losing,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.680]   you know, they lose money on it on these. I put them makeup for it in volume.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.440]   But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if the record companies are giving them part of a break
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.920]   on this because I do think that they want to get away from iTunes. Sure. And this catalog
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.840]   doesn't sell dominant. Right. And if people get in the habit of going, Oh, cool, I can get the
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:17.560]   Lady Gaga album, you know, spinal Tappy as the cover may be for 99 cents. Maybe I'll come back
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.400]   as long as they keep shoveling these sort of bargains to me. And then you get people to sign
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.400]   up for Amazon who haven't before. Now they've got you on their mailing list. They can send you
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.720]   out. They'll say, Hey, by the way, you love that Lady Gaga thing. Look, her mother Madonna is coming
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.400]   out with a new album next week. And I'll tell you how bad it is. I almost bought Jay Z's first album
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.160]   because it's on sale this morning for three for I think three 99. I don't even like Jay Z.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:48.200]   But it's four bucks. But it's four bucks. It's like you're getting six dollars for free. Come on.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:54.040]   Right. You're making money on the deal. I was this close. And maybe I will because it is. It's four bucks.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.880]   But I do think I might.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.800]   I don't know what Amazon is doing for music a little bit what Apple did for apps where
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.640]   they've taken the prices to this low level where no, I mean, and that's not like everybody's
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.720]   making a lot of money. And it's just like with the app store where there are thousands and
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.760]   thousands of developers with 99 cent and dollar 99 apps who are only making like a
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.680]   they're lucky if they make a couple hundred bucks a month. You know, they're not doing it as a
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.600]   career. It's not a lot of money. But some a lot of developers are and they've changed the dynamics
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:34.360]   of the price times quantity equals revenue from the way it used to be before the app store to now.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.800]   Like in the old days, share where or whatever you wanted to call it indie software. Like even
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.920]   nine 99 was considered super cheap. Like lots and lots of utilities were, you know, started at
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.560]   around 20 bucks. I mean, in the 15 and $10 price range was the low end. And with, I mean, some of
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.400]   the apps you can get for a 99 cents are just astounding. You can just tell huge amounts of work went into
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   it. And presumably, if they're doing well, it's because you're making way less money per sale,
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.920]   but making so many more sales than you ever did or could have imagined before that it makes up for.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.560]   And I think Amazon does that with music. I think that some of these albums have got to be selling
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:19.400]   so many more copies at four or five bucks than they ever would have at $11.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.800]   Well, if you're Ray Charles or even Jay Z and you're selling this catalog,
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:31.000]   and you sold, you know, 500,000 at three 99 yesterday, that's all good. That's all golden.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.640]   And part of it's just keeping back catalog music alive.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.840]   Right. People were asking like the survival members of the Beatles, why would you do something
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.240]   as cranky as licensed your music to Cirque du Soleil? Why would you do something like do a
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:51.400]   video game based on it? Why would the John Lennon's John Lennon? Why would John Lennon's estate
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.640]   allow like old footage of John Lennon to be used to advertise a car in Europe? And the answer
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.920]   always comes back because you're a new gender. Well, I'm sorry.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.320]   Is that the answer?
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.520]   If you're a business, you know, that love is the answer.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:17.400]   I lost my hippie card. But they always bring up a point that because we are generation and the
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.040]   generation that came right after us grew up with familiar familiarity with these people that we
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.960]   know who Sinatra is. We know who the Marx Brothers are. We know who the Beatles are. But there are
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.880]   new generations that were born in the 80s and the 90s who didn't would incur up with that music
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.520]   coming out of every single radio and every single TV set. And so they need that it's valuable to
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.000]   them if they're not making a lot of money on these five dollar albums. At least it's getting
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.080]   people who are 18, 19, 21 to buy a Ray Charles album and maybe associate that with a really good
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.200]   performer that they'd like to keep plugged into. There's actually another interesting fact I've
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.080]   learned about people who are in there probably, you know, well, at this point early 20s, late teens,
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.520]   early 20s, which is that popular cultures become fairly fragmented. So they don't have a lot in
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:09.640]   common with one another. And so when I've gone to, I mean, I'm an Ithaca, so I go see things at Cornell
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:17.240]   quite a lot. And when students have to come up with costumes or themes or things like that,
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:25.320]   they often go back to the 80s, 70s, 60s, because that's what they have in common still because of
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.200]   their parents. Oh, you think that's why? Because I noticed that in high schools too. They listen
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.880]   into classic rock and I'm thinking, what? It's because all of the other stuff is so fragmented
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.880]   that, you know, everyone has their own little niche, niche market, but but everyone still knows
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:45.800]   who the Beatles are. Right. Right. I think now it's because today's music is no darn good. It's true.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:54.120]   Stinking music all this noise, it's noise, noise, noise, there the rap music today gives me a headache.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:01.800]   It does me doing that hip-hoppy stuff. It must is my hair. You know, I can't knock the
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.400]   hustle. I can't knock the hustle. When I was a kid, our trousers were straight. These flared
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:13.960]   trousers. I don't get to walk those damn flared trousers. Waste coats too. I saw a kid going to
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:20.440]   school without a waste coat. And I'm spats. No, spats? What do you splash the mud on some horse
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:27.640]   poo on your shoe there? And now while we each added additional onion to our belts.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.160]   Hey, we want to do our picks of the week. But Danny, I know there's a few more stories you want
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:38.120]   to cover. We're not actually actually we've been talking and talking and talking and having a good
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   time. There was I think we can go right to picks of the week. Okay. I will say the jackpot question.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:51.080]   Unfortunately, there was going to be a winner of this week's jackpot question for the panel
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.240]   who was going to win this beautiful Hanson, Jim Lee Batman Batman bus.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.680]   If I save that for another time, then I get to keep the Batman bus for another couple of weeks.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.080]   So what's the ruin? Ruin this.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.720]   We're going to take a break. Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.520]   Mr. Chris Breen, Andy Anatko, Adam Inks, John Gruber. But before we do, I want to thank our
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.960]   friends at Citrix who make so many great remote access products, including a fantastic go to
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:25.800]   meeting, go to meeting saves me a lot of headaches. We do unfortunately, we have a lot of meetings.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.240]   I get off the off the air every afternoon when Tom does TNT. And what do I do? I go to my office
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:37.160]   and it's conference calls with vendors with contractors, with people who want to work with
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.160]   us, people want jobs. And it's great. I mean, I really, it saves me a lot of time. I don't have
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:47.320]   to travel all over the place to meet people, to talk to people, to pitch people. But a teleconference
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.480]   can just be deadly. And you know, you hear the other guy on the other side and you can just tell
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.400]   he's answering his email or he's searching Amazon for a great deal on Ray Charles records. And it's
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:05.080]   just not, it's just not satisfying. So the reason we use go to meeting here almost every day is
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.920]   because it just makes, first of all, it's easier to set up a meeting. You put, you can try it right
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.040]   now, Mac or PC, you put go to meeting on your system by going to go to meeting.com, click that
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.200]   try it free button right in the middle there. I think it's what color is that orange kind of
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:24.200]   orangeish. And tell them when they ask for a promo code, use the promo code Mac break,
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.320]   Mac break. And you'll have 30 days free of go to me. Now that it's on your computer, anytime you're
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.440]   going to have a meeting, we actually, it's funny. We now we've got, we've got a code in the office.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.960]   I'll send you a G2M. And I think sometimes people have no idea what we're talking about. But you'll
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.200]   press a button and it sets up the meeting. It sends a meeting invitation. They can, it
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.480]   includes in their calendar link and so forth. And that way the meeting, it pops up what in their
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.520]   calendar or they get the email and it says, click this link, it takes them to go to meeting.com,
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.680]   even if they've never used it before, 30 seconds later, the software is ready, it's going.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.880]   It's completely secure by the way, 128 bit SSL, absolutely flawless stuff. And they're meeting
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.800]   with you. They can use voiceover IP. So if they're on an iPad, there's a free iPad app,
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.600]   they can just use the speaker and the mic built into the iPad. They don't even need a phone
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.680]   connection, but it also provides as part of the service a conference bridge with an actual
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   telephone number and you know, the meeting code and all that stuff. It is just the easiest way
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.000]   to set up a meeting. Now we do it even if we don't have to show people anything. But the beauty is,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.760]   if we do want to show them something, it's there, it's ready and we can show them what's on the
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:35.080]   screen. They can show us what's on their screen. We can give them control. So it's great for training.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.320]   It is just the simplest, easiest way to get meetings started to get meetings effectively
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.960]   handled. It just makes you more efficient and more productive. I don't know how to say it
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.200]   better, but this is a product we love and use all the time and to it. And I encourage you,
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.640]   if you've not used it, and maybe you've used some of the other teleconferencing solutions,
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.320]   maybe you've been burning, you say, I'm not trying this. No, please. This is so easy.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.280]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button and the promo code for this. If you would,
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.320]   and we'd appreciate it if you use it is Mac break. That way they know where you heard it and we get
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:14.520]   credit for it. Go to meeting.com, try it free button, Mac break do, do give that a try.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:19.640]   Also, we don't know, we don't judge. So if you want to treat it more like go to home.com
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.760]   so you can stay at work, stay at the bar, not have to tuck your kids in. It's just as good for that.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   Your money's just as good. You know, it's actually true. I was sitting out in the
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.520]   yard back here with the flowers and this beautiful and the birds are singing and I've got my iPad
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.760]   in my hand and I'm doing a meeting here. And it was just kind of cool. And I plugged in my,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:42.200]   you know, iPhone headset and it's just like sitting here doing a meeting. It's kind of fun.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.600]   It's kind of cool. You don't feel like you're working.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:50.440]   Yeah, you just want to be the stereotypical Californian who like every one of these
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.760]   courses at a conference room with suits and ties. You're like, hey, with a classic shirt,
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:00.680]   nay, glasses, a word of advice. So if you were in the hot tub, turn the bubbler off because it
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:07.880]   really annoys them. And don't, you know, don't say, Hey, bunny and cherry, come on in the water's
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.080]   great. No, you don't need your bikini tops. That kind of thing doesn't go down well. I just want to
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   say yes. It would be a good use case for those. I pushed it a little far. I'm sorry.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:24.280]   For one of those noise canceling things, you know how like the Nexus S and the iPhone 4 have
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.080]   that extra microphone and it filters out like crowd noise. Yeah, we need one for hot tub bubbles.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.000]   Hot tub, hot tub bubbles. This filter is the right.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.800]   Now Leo, is there like a, is there like a, like a PayPal contribution to pay for your smoking
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.040]   jack in an ascot when we finished building the between making you know the playmates and I
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.880]   have really enjoyed the time. I believe I hear Moby setting up here in the portal for a number.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:54.520]   Yes. Let's listen in. You cut. I have some influences, but I have to say house party is a huge
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:03.960]   influence. If I could make little points, Jimmy, if I could make the Twig cottage be like the playboy
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.360]   house party of tech. Well, I look over here. Mark Zuckerberg's chatting up one of our producers.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.720]   Mark, tell me about the latest with Facebook. I would just love that.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:18.520]   Can I be like the really, the really crappy oil painting artist who runs the paint,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.200]   everything treated like a serious artist, even though he's just like a like a cigarette
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.120]   at McRoyed Neiman. I know you're talking about Andy and not cozy over there doing
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.920]   another great painting of Cassius Clay. How's it going, Andy? But I have to wonder, you know,
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.240]   whenever we do, we do our half an hour imitation, why do we always go to Jim Bacchus and Stine?
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.760]   I know. Well, is this there is a little talk to you know, we're going to go down here.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.800]   May I say Miffy and Biffy over in the Hampton?
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.840]   Because you have not only wished he could be as sexy as Jim Bacchus.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:53.800]   He got some of the action that Mr. McGoo got. I do have the smoke on the Mr. McGoo for a reason,
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.400]   you know. I have both the smoking jacket and the pipe, so I'm ready to go.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.600]   Around. Yes. All we need is a grotto.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.000]   And a bottle of oil penicillin.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.720]   And people sitting around kind of snapping their fingers to us as we have.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.560]   And like, I can't get an interception here.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.960]   I think actually, I may be wrong, but didn't they have Legionnaires disease
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.840]   outbreak in the grotto? I think they did. I'm not kidding. Anyway,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.840]   let's do our picks of the week. I think I'm just going to go clockwise in our Hollywood
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.520]   squares thing, which means we'll start with Mr. Chris Breen and his pick.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.440]   Okay, this is a pre pick, which means this product isn't out and I've never used it.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.120]   But I already want it.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.800]   I don't care. I've looked at pictures and say, I want that. Good.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:49.960]   This is made by a Lisa or will be made by a Lisa's, the music instrument manufacturer.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.800]   Good stuff. It is called the IO doc. And the idea is it's made for one of these.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.680]   It's made for your iPad. And so you slip this thing into this dock and it puts the
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:06.920]   iPad at an angle. And it provides. It's a mixing board, essentially.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:13.560]   So you have two inputs, both XLR as well as guitar plug inputs. You have phantom power. So
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:17.000]   you can plug your mic in there. If you have an expensive mic that needs to power it will work
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.760]   with that. It has a foot switch. If you need to use a sustained pedal or something that's plugged
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:28.600]   into it on the side, it has a MIDI in an out port. It has volume switches. You plug a power thing
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.480]   into it. It has headphones. It has a main output. And the idea is that you plug this thing into
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:39.160]   your iPad. So you don't need to use the dock connector or the camera connector anymore. But
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:45.240]   you put it into this thing. And most music applications will work for it. So if you use garage band on
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.240]   the iPad, it just works. So now you can plug your guitar into this dock instead of the instead of
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:57.080]   a dongle, as well as a microphone and then switch between the two because you can't record both
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.680]   channels simultaneously. Supposedly, it's coming out in June. It looks like everybody's going to
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:09.960]   sell it for $200. And I like it. Cool. It looks really cool. It looks like garage band, right? So
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:16.040]   yeah, it works. They show you a demo of it working with garage band. Although they're just advertising
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.960]   now in some places still have the old name, which I think was called Sound Doc. So it shows you
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:29.720]   it's just coming together at this point. It looks very cool because trying to do
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:35.800]   MIDI in particular on an iPad is a challenge. And if this thing really works and Apple really
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:41.400]   lets it happen, I think it's going to be a fabulous device for musicians. Very cool. Doesn't it sound
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:47.240]   like that device, that legendary device from four or five years ago that ThinkSecret got all
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:52.280]   that trouble for leaking the... Oh, that was an Apple branded device.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.360]   Right. And I think that was a setup, right? It wasn't that just to trap people who were
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:02.600]   leaking it. It might have been. I mean, as legend has it, it may or may not have been
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:07.160]   something that they had no intention of actually making as it only existed to
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:12.040]   entrap a leaker. Isn't that funny? That would kind of serve Apple, right? Because
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.840]   even when they're trying to do a fake product just to trap people, they will accidentally design
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:22.200]   something brilliant. That people wanted everybody. ThinkSeeker it leaked it and there were all
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.960]   these people who were musicians and you know, they were professional and they were like,
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.080]   oh, that sounds great. Can't wait for that. Take my money now. So Chris, is there a date for
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:36.680]   availability? Is there a price? Do we know? I've seen the price that people seem to be selling for
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.800]   is $199. That's perfect. And they said it's supposed to come out in June. I thought I think I saw some
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:48.200]   site that said coming June 10th. But you know, who knows soon? Yeah, soon. I hope so because I
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.240]   really would love to have one of these kidding. That's awesome. Good pick, Andy and I go your
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:59.080]   pick. My pick is a really awesome enhancement for any calender program you're actually using.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:04.440]   It's called Fantastic Al and it's by a company called Flexibits.com to make some other really cool
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:10.840]   stuff. But it's I love it because I've never been able to get into iCal. I know it works okay.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:16.520]   And it's been around for three, four, five years. But I still tend to use my inbox as my scheduler.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.000]   Right. I just sort of kind of remember that, oh, that's right. Let's let's start off. It's
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.480]   May 1st. Let's look at make sure we know all my appointments for the month. Obviously, obviously,
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.320]   if I know I'm flying to Sweden at the end of September, I know I'm flying to Sweden at the
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.080]   end of September. At some point, I check my inbox and I get the dates and I get the time so I need
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.720]   to make arrangements. But it's just I just cannot get myself into the habit of tapping over to iCal.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.640]   Click type the right to click type the date. Click type the description. Fantastic Al is
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:48.360]   incredible because it just puts a calendar icon in your menu bar. Okay, you've seen that before,
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:53.000]   but you haven't seen the way that it works. You tap it and you simply type in pretty much natural
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.240]   English what the appointment is. So I can type lunch with John at the Sizzler the second Saturday
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:12.760]   in November and it's all you can eat bacon shrimp. And it's doing like really subtle things to realize
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.480]   that, okay, John is the person I'm meeting with the second Saturday in November.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:22.200]   Is it full news contact from address book? I don't believe it pulls context, but you can
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.720]   actually watch it. The great thing is you can actually watch it during it. It does this dropdown
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:31.080]   you can see behind me right now. It does a dropdown calendar and you can actually see it populating
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:37.480]   all of the fields of the appointment as you type. So it's making guesses as you go and sort of
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.640]   visually confirming that it's guessing correctly without actually stopping you doing anything.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.200]   And nine times out of 10, you just simply type a sentence that describes who you're meeting with,
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.440]   what the where you're meeting, what day and what time, and it will just simply result in a
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:57.880]   in a really well done calendar appointment. And it also will give you just a quick dropdown
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.040]   of here's what you've got. Here's what you got coming up today and this week. So you're always
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.320]   dipping in to check to see what you got. Now, number one, I love it because it takes a function
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.800]   that I should be doing with just by discipline and letting me do it because they've given me a
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.840]   really good tool for doing it. The second thing though is that it's a very, very pretty app. I
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.880]   don't think you could build this app for any other operating system because the other operating
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.760]   systems don't have that kind of aesthetic. It doesn't have this sort of mandate that says
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.000]   it doesn't have to it's not good enough. If it's just functional, it also has to be pretty and
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.440]   has to look good and has to work really, really, it's a delicious app, definitely.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.120]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's really just it's really just terrific. I have never gone. So as a matter
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.880]   of fact, I think I first heard about it on on on during fireball and I have never I can't remember
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:52.920]   the last time I've gone so quickly from clicking to install a demo to typing, I think all of 18
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:59.320]   characters to clicking back into the app store and buying it. It's $15 until until I think the
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.480]   price goes up at the end of the month, but for the month of May, at least it's 15 bucks and I
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.880]   have gone from somebody who just has to sort of keep part of a schedule in his head and just trust
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:15.000]   that I remember that, Oh, that's right. I do have to fly across eight time zones tomorrow at it to
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.840]   somebody who really is very, very diligent about updating and referring to a calendar.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.000]   So highest recommendation, really great stuff. I would have been looking at it with lust,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.760]   but I'm so tied to busy cow, not I cow that I'm worried. I think it works with busy cow. Does it?
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:34.280]   It's just not ideal though. It's it's not as a little bit. What happens is I think,
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.320]   I hope I'm getting this right, but I think I am because I use busy cow too. And I now use
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.840]   fantastic cow is that it doesn't integrate directly with busy cow. So when you enter an event
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.600]   in fantastic cow, and then you go to busy cow a second later, it's not there yet. You have to
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:56.440]   wait for the cow dev sinking to kick in. So you're subscribed to your I cal calendars in busy cow
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:02.760]   via cal dev. And then you'll get it. So it yeah, right. So the stuff shows up in busy cow after a
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.320]   round trip to wherever your calendar server is. So it could be I think it would work with Google
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.080]   calendar. That's my issue because I don't want to subscribe to I cal calendars. I just don't want
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:19.560]   to use I cal at all. So it's like I map for calendars. Okay. Right. So if you use mobile me,
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.040]   right. So like if you use mobile me, it goes both ways. I'm pretty sure that's how Google
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.120]   calendar works. I think it's cal dev. If it works with Google calendar, I'd be very happy.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.880]   The only difference see with I cal, it's a direct talk. It talks directly to I cal storage on your
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:40.040]   file. So one second later, after you've entered an event in fantastic, fantastic. You can go to I
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.400]   cal and it's already there. Busy Cal, it takes a couple seconds because you have to wait for
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.040]   the sinking. Right. But it does work. It works. I do I do wish to add a couple features. I wish
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.280]   I had the ability to set a reminder for it right in the middle of that confirmation. I wish I could
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.400]   drag a file or drag a URL or drag an email into it. Because time and time again, I do find myself
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.600]   saying, well, having to go into I cal just to add the tag. Oh, please email me about this to remind
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.440]   me one day in advance. If it just had but too extra lines in that form, it would be absolutely
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.960]   perfect, but good heavens. It's so completely worth 15 bucks that if I found out that the
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.640]   developer had broken into my house, gone into that big fish bowl full of change,
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.160]   take not to fist the quarters and left a note saying I took $15. Here's your license. I'd say,
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.760]   okay, I'm upset you didn't tell me beforehand. I hope you tell me which window you open to get in,
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.240]   but I can't agree with that. That's a very good product. Thank you.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.960]   It is now time for your pick of the week, Mr. John Gruber.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:45.400]   I will give you my pick, but first I will just add just on top of Andy's thing with Fantastic
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:51.080]   Cal just and I'm not making this up. I think 500 people have made the same observation before,
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.600]   but with I cal, there's this rule of thumb with Apple products where you can tell which one Steve
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.960]   Jobs uses and which one he doesn't. And with I cal, I don't think there's any doubt that he
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:06.920]   looks at his calendar and I cal, but you know, you know that he doesn't enter his own events.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:12.520]   Somebody else is doing that. Click on the day, click on the month, click on the year,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:18.040]   click on the time, click on the minute, click on the second, click on the 100th of a second,
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:23.320]   click on the 1000th of a second, click on AMPM. You know that he doesn't enter his own events.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.040]   And Fantastic Cal, it's like, just like Andy said, it's like you get to be a guy with an
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.960]   assistant where you just say, look, I'm having lunch Tuesday at noon. And that's all you type.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:37.400]   What have I got for two people? Are you out there? All right,
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:43.000]   right, get out of the grotto. I'm sorry. And bring my secretary while you're at it.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:50.520]   Is a it's a new iPhone weather app. And I know that there's 10,000 of these weather apps and
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:56.040]   Ben went like when they're apps, Ben Brooks, I think that did the greatest thing. He did one of those
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:02.120]   write-ups where he like went through the app store a couple weeks ago and did like a survey of like
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.480]   20 different other apps. And it's sort of you're looking in and we're all the princess with the
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:12.120]   P when it comes to weather apps where everybody wants a little bit more everybody wants more
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.920]   info than you can get by looking out your window. But we don't want to become meteorologists.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:23.480]   Everybody has like this sweet spot in their head of just how much information you want. And
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:30.120]   but you want it to be super super fast. So I often go back to Apple's weather app because it's fast.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.000]   You just launch it and it doesn't take very long at all to get updated info. But it just doesn't
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.720]   tell you that much more than the temperature and whether there's any chance of rain today or not.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.640]   You know what I want? I want the dew point.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:51.560]   So shine is a new one that for me personally hits the sweet spot a it does the dew point.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:32:01.400]   It does. So it opens up with with what you see right here on the screen. But if you scroll down
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.960]   it gives you like a sort of not scroll down on the web page but scroll down in the app. It gives
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:12.200]   you like a hour by hour forecast for the next few hours. Which for me is a huge deal and it
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.400]   it's what I don't get from Apple's weather app. It's like for example I'm coaching my son's
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:23.320]   T ball team and we have practice every Monday at 5 30. So if I'm going to cancel practice because
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:27.800]   of rain I kind of need to know not just whether it's going to rain at all today because if it's
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.920]   going to rain at night we're still going to have practice. I kind of need to know what
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.520]   what are the odds that it's going to rain around 5 30. And shine does that. And it doesn't weigh
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.160]   you down with all that stuff that makes you feel like you should be doing the weather on TV.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.280]   And there's plenty of other apps that are great for that if you really do want radar and all
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:50.840]   these other things. But for 99 cents this app to me is great. Now the only downside
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:57.000]   is that it's US only right now. That's the biggest downside is that I don't think it has
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.880]   international weather. But if you're in the US really really worth a look for 99 cents.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.040]   And you need to point.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.960]   Oh let's see.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.640]   Everything's dewy in the grotto Chris.
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:18.680]   I was wondering you know. But I think that's where you that's what do we hide do we lips.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:23.080]   Yeah I believe that Dewey grotto is art with pinup for me.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:31.400]   And the brothers Huey and Louie. You're picking the week Adam.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:37.480]   Well this is this is a little along the lines of Chris's in terms of that haven't actually
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.680]   used it yet. But I am dying to find a little bit of free time to start going through it.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:48.760]   For those who are word processor fans because you actually write.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:54.280]   My one of my my favorite word processor of yesterday I'm sort of looking at the
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.880]   webpage over here on the iPad. Nice. Nice. Nice.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:05.720]   This writer pro 2.0 just shipped with the most amazing change release notes I have ever seen.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.320]   I didn't even know they were still around.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:14.040]   It's been two years since this major upgrade. And I mean okay so you know how Apple release notes
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:19.160]   work. You know fixes first a lot stability and reliability and it takes you know that and if
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.680]   you're lucky they outline two or three. Well I actually did a search and copied the release notes
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:29.560]   for nicest writer pro 2.0 out to out to be the edit and the line count on it. We're talking over
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.160]   500 changes. It's like two years they've been busy.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.640]   Yeah and you look at the top ones here they did track changes they did drawing tools they did
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:43.800]   watermarks they did a vertical ruler they've saved PDF with all the wonderful PDF goodness like
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:49.640]   links and tables of contents and all that. They can do link to inserted images on disk they've got
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:57.560]   you know they prove they're commenting. I mean I mean suddenly I mean I've never really gotten
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.280]   back into nicest writer pro since Mac OS 10 they just they were too slow when coming to Mac OS 10.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:07.400]   I used to use it in a classic for years and finally had to give it up. And nicest writer pro was always
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.480]   been sort of a good effort but never quite there. And if this thing lives up to the features they're
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:19.800]   telling me here Microsoft Word pages they've all got a serious run for their money because
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:26.600]   this is this is one heck of a feature list. I was a huge nicest fan for so many years. Oh yeah
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:32.360]   macros they've got Mac they've got grip searching they've got beautiful grip searching that anybody
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.880]   can use because it's graphical if you don't know how to do all the fancy little grip codes which I
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   do now because I've become a BB edit user but but I mean I had to go to BB edit after nicest because
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:51.640]   I needed to. Yep. Yep. So this is available now. It is available now just came out a couple days
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:57.800]   ago and I said I'm dying to dip into it and start doing some writing universal binary. Yeah.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.080]   Now I have a license for the first I imagine I'll have to upgrade. It's only 49 bucks. 49 bucks.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:08.120]   It's a bad. It's a bad upgrade. 79 if you want to buy the full full version. I will buy it just
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.720]   to support them. I think they're great. They're great guys. Yeah. Yeah. Good picks all around and
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:23.080]   thank you all for a great show starting with Chris Breen the Mac Daddy Macworld.com. Hey now. Hey now.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:31.560]   Jeff. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. He's a good looking fella. Nothing on you though Chris.
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:36.840]   Oh well thank you for being and thanks for having me. I always have a great time here. We got to
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.720]   have you on more often. Anytime you don't actually know how we could have you on more often than
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.880]   twice in the last three weeks but we ought to do. Okay. If we can figure out a way.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.960]   All right. Great. Great to have you. Just set up a set up a cotton the corner. Yeah.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.680]   You want to move in? You can. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here Chris.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.360]   Thank you to John Gruber of daring fireball dot net always a great pleasure having you on to.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.600]   Thanks Leo. I'm looking around. I can't find it. My office is a little dish. I was looking for
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:09.000]   my autographed picture of Donald Trump but I just pretend I'm holding it. Do you really have one?
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.680]   Come on. No not yet. He's holding that for it though.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.680]   Right. Also to Adam Inks of tidbits the longest running
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.720]   Mac newsletter publisher in the whole history of the universe.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.120]   I was looking on the top of my desk which is unfortunately a little bit of a mess for
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:31.160]   something to show off and you know I was looking forward to what I was looking for was my move button.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:38.920]   Oh really remember the history. This was given to me by Mark Johnson who started ftp.apple.com
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.400]   on a two C. I under his desk was the first major Apple internet server. Wow.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:46.920]   So.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:47.720]   Move.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.360]   Talk cow.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.160]   Move.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.480]   Um and Andy has cows so it kind of works perfectly.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.000]   There you go.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.160]   They're not dogs but we don't know they might say move.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.960]   They're very obedient. They're loyal. They're hardworking.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.440]   Andy and I go is at the Chicago Sun times in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.360]   I was thinking that I would be in France for the EG eight
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:13.880]   today so Andy very kindly jumped in and did all the work and then I canceled at the last minute.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.600]   Jeff Jarvis is there and he's already stirring up trouble.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:21.960]   According to the Wall Street Journal he leapt to his feet when Sarkozy was talking and said
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.880]   but what about first do no harm and Sarkozy shut him down.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.160]   So we'll get a report tomorrow on this weekend.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160]   And there was some harm done is what you're saying.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.800]   Well Sarkozy I can't remember the exact quote but
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.960]   Sarkozy you know kind of.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.200]   This was the issue. Corey Doctorow said I'm not going to go.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.920]   I was invited. I'm not going to go because Sarkozy has an agenda.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:46.680]   He just wants to use our names to rubber stamp his draconian internet restrictions
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.480]   and and Corey didn't want to do that to the credit of Jeff Jarvis and John Perry Barlow
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.600]   both of whom went along with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and I think Steve Ballmer's
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.280]   there. I think Bill Gates is there a lot of big names but to the credit John Perry Barlow
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.280]   and Jeff Jarvis who I know have that as their agenda.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.920]   They're going to have to fight the fight apparently but it'll be interesting.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.480]   We'll get a report tomorrow on this week Google.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.680]   They packed a whole carry-on bag full of extra shoes just for throwing.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.400]   Yeah I wish I could be there.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.720]   I'm sorry I'm not but I'm glad I could be here for this.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.440]   This was a lot of fun.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.080]   So Andy thank you for jumping in and doing the show.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.720]   I appreciate it.
