[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.

[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.000]   This is Twit.

[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.720]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 28 for February 6, 2007.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   Inconceivable.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:50.560]   You know, I think this is rapidly becoming my favorite time
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.160]   of the week, the time we get together,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.680]   to talk about Macintosh.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.280]   Around the table, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.400]   Hey, Alex.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.640]   Hey.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.400]   Scott Bourne, who is Mr. I Life Zone and a man about town,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480]   now about our town, some of the time.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.240]   Well, in seven days.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.880]   I'm excited.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.960]   That's neat.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.200]   We can all visit his penthouse.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   Maybe we'll do the show from the penthouse.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.600]   We're from the roof, can we?
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.280]   We can do it from the roof because there's
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960]   a 360 degree view of the city.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.000]   Two-penet's audio.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.160]   Merlin Mann.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.520]   We can shoot video, too.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   The man who is Mr. Productivity
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.360]   and is now wasting his time on Twitter.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   Yes.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.720]   You finally ground me down.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   My evil plan is working.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.080]   Now people can know when I'm enjoying a sandwich
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.600]   or petting my kitty.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.400]   It's all available.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680]   Let me see what your last post is, Merlin.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.200]   You don't post nearly enough.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.760]   You know who's on here now, though?
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   People like Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.480]   Geez.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.720]   I mean, this is Evan Williams Project.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.680]   Kind of a little audio thing, yeah?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.000]   You know it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.960]   Listen to this little thing that obvious does.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.400]   I got to say the big difference that made me
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.680]   re-adopt this from before is that I don't
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.880]   have to have it on my phone.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.440]   When it was on my phone, it made me look crazy.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.000]   Oh, well, it also could be expensive because the way it
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200]   works is it's not an instant message client,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   but it's kind of reminiscent of it,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.840]   except that you're not really talking to any one person.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.640]   You're broadcasting what you're doing right now.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.920]   And people can follow you and watch what you're doing right
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.480]   now.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   Merlin, I don't know what you're doing.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.520]   I mean--
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, that's a line from a song, I think,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.040]   because I'm actually secretly a 12-year-old girl.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.840]   I love it.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   It's very funny.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   So people are doing that.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.040]   People are putting quotes in.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.000]   What do people usually say?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.080]   They say, oh, I'm sitting here on a meat nataco,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   or is that usually what they're doing?
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   It's kind of an away message without the aim.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.240]   Yeah, it's like away messages on steroids.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.960]   Although, I think a lot of people are putting funny quotes
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.000]   in and intentionally obscure it and stuff, which I like.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240]   It's just strange.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   All right, well, I'll update mine.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.640]   I'm a little over-indulgent.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.560]   You see how you're sealing, Kat?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.920]   What's sealing, Kat?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.880]   You go to mine, you see sealing, Kat.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.360]   Sailing, Kat's up in the ceiling watching you.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.760]   Did you see that?
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.600]   Twitter.com/Hodgogsladies, right?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.000]   That's right.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.160]   Is that where we'll see sealing, Kat?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   Explaining sealing, Kat.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yes, see, there's something strange about Twitter,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.240]   and I can't quite figure it out.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.200]   I think it's for lonely people.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.680]   Like--
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440]   Yeah, that describes you guys real well.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   Exactly.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.000]   I'm my only friend.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   So the story of the week is what didn't happen
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.640]   as a scot-borne so eloquently put it.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.480]   What?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.000]   [HONKING]
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.440]   On Sunday.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.280]   No big apple.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.320]   There was no ad at all from Apple.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.760]   There was nothing from Apple.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.920]   There was no wardrobe malfunction, which really disappointed me.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.280]   I don't want to see Princess nipples.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's OK.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.360]   I thought--
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.320]   Well, it's nothing to do with prints.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.240]   In the rain, in the frickin' rain,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   in the look terrific.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   It's brilliant.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   I was waiting for him to be electrocuted, actually.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.200]   I was a little nervous.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.040]   I figured they put something down to--
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.320]   And I was worried about the way that the dance--
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.360]   What a pro to be able to walk out there.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.880]   So good.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   I don't got in his heels.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   And he's walking around there, and his suit looked fantastic.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   He played like a pro.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He shredded.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.480]   He went.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   He went as fantastic.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240]   No, not at all.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.360]   He's a god.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.120]   He doesn't get wet.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.200]   Anyway, I'm now a once again, I think the whole world rediscovered prints.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.320]   Apparently he's doing a Vegas show, somebody told me.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   He's got going to be like--
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.320]   It looks pretty good for '63.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   He's--
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   He could be.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.000]   He's been around forever.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760]   He's so good.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   Anyway.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.520]   But yeah, there was no Apple ad.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.800]   There was no Apple announcement.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.840]   There was no Apple nothing.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.440]   There wasn't even any fruit.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.720]   OK, I'm going to avoid that line,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   because I've already been in trouble once by offhand comments
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.720]   about people.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   So--
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.920]   You just set me up.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.680]   Please, I ask you.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   I put it on a T for you.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.440]   Consider--
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.040]   Consider me armed and dangerous, OK?
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.400]   OK.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.440]   At least my tongue.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.720]   There was a rumor going around.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   I'm trying to find it here on the dig.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   But there was a rumor going around
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.720]   that they had an actual ad on deck and ready to go.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.160]   And it got bumped for some reason.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.080]   Oh, please, of course.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.000]   Did we see this rumor?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.240]   No.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.840]   And it's not credible.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   Is it?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.680]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   You're saying we're only going to talk about credible rumors?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah, of course not.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.520]   What was I thinking?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.400]   I just loved how, as far as I know,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.160]   you, Merlin, created the initial rumor
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.920]   that there was going to be a Beatles iPod.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.040]   Why did you bring this up, Merlin?
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.920]   Why did it make you a Beatles iPod?
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   But then what's great about it is it's spun out of control.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.640]   And I saw from all-- now we know how rumors happen.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.480]   You know how it happens?
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.840]   Frickin' Leo Laporte goes out there and repeats it.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.480]   That's how it happens.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.800]   Over and over.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.520]   Over and over.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.880]   Ooh, I heard Merlin said there's going to be an iPod.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.160]   I did.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   I gave 20 interviews.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360]   Well, the next day, everybody's like,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   you know Leo's going out there and telling people all the stuff
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.040]   he made up.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   He's going out and saying, you know,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.920]   your reputation's on the line.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.400]   No, no, no.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.240]   I'm like, A, what reputation?
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.800]   B, Leo.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.920]   Yeah, I heard Paul McCartney actually talking
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.320]   about Merlin's predictions.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.840]   It was crazy.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.800]   No, but it immediately got separated away from Merlin.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.320]   I'm glad to say it.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.720]   Nobody said Merlin, man, in fact, that's
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.920]   how it achieves the status of truth, right?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.560]   You don't say, oh, some guy on a podcast said it.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.720]   You say, I've heard.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.760]   And I'm telling you, a number of Apple rumor blogs
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.720]   repeated this as if it comes straight from Cupertino.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.840]   Instead of straight from Merlin's butt.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.560]   In the right of my butt, which I think, if you go back
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   and listen, go back and listen to yourself.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   You tried to shut it down right then.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.160]   I identified my butt as my source on that
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.440]   from very early on.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.800]   And you were mortified right away.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.840]   In the moment.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.960]   But I wouldn't let it go, and I'm glad.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.800]   Because you know what I can count on you in the future,
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.680]   I want to count on you as somebody that can pass terrible
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.240]   information to and then spread that to more credible sources.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.800]   Yeah, I could be used that way.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.680]   You're like a virus.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   I could be used by enemy agents to spread bad information.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.000]   But I think it's a good--
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.520]   I'm still saying it's what Apple should do.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.240]   I heard it repeated so many times now.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.640]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.520]   I mean, it is interesting to think about--
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.120]   I mean, especially in light of now they've
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.880]   got the all the different colored shuffles and stuff
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.360]   like that.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.240]   And we don't want that.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.600]   We want a wide screen touch iPod.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.600]   I don't care if it's got Beatles on it or not.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.800]   I want the iPod.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.960]   I'm really disappointed, frankly.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.840]   I have to admit, one of the big things
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.400]   that I've heard about a lot about the iPhone
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.160]   is a lot of people are talking about, well,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.480]   do you know how expensive singular's data plan is?
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.120]   I know, because I pay for it.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.200]   Well, but the funny thing is, is that I
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.760]   realize that with a Wi-Fi hook to the phone,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.520]   I just don't expect to use it that much.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.760]   I don't have any expectation of using more than 10 minutes
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.560]   max or a handful of times.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   Because, ironically, I'll be using a singular device
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.680]   to mostly surf through the T-Mobile network, which
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.640]   is at every Starbucks, which is what I do now.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.720]   And so I just think it's interesting that I realize
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.640]   that I really care more about the Wi-Fi and the wide screen
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   iPod than I care about the phone part.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.040]   Well, no, no, here we are.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.400]   A month later, almost.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.000]   Is the honeymoon over for the iPhone?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.200]   You still guys still going to-- who's
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.040]   going to get in line and buy one?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.000]   Well, we're going to get you all that for--
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.200]   I know somebody who's going to get in line and buy at least four.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.040]   No, I don't think he is.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.320]   He's not getting off that easy.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.640]   Now wait a minute.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   Let's replay the videotape.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.960]   Are you going to try-- you're going to-- I knew it.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   Are you going to try and weasel it?
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.800]   What I said was, if they're shipping the day of the keynote,
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.240]   I would buy one for everybody.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.400]   All you have to do is go back and listen, Mr. Man.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   There weasel.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   There weasel.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:24.920]   There weasel.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.360]   It simply didn't happen, so I'm off the hook.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.440]   Now, if you're nice to me between now and then,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   maybe I'll reconsider.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   No, that's good.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   You get out of it by adding some kind of emotional--
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.880]   I don't really want one.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.960]   Oh, quit it.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   I just want my freebie.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.760]   I guess I would say that I would buy it with or without the phone
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   service.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.800]   If it had everything the iPhone's promising and no phone
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   service, I'd still buy it.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   The phone is important.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.880]   I mean, I'd love to get rid of my extra phone.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.800]   But having all that inner connectivity, in fact,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.880]   there's part of me that would rather have the iPhone available
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.000]   as more like a milo, like the Sony milo.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.320]   That's what I just played the milo sandwich.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.280]   I would much rather-- I would actually prefer it
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   when I started thinking about all the limitations that
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.040]   we're getting because singular is involved.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.280]   I have to admit there's part of me
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.720]   that just wishes they'd put one out without similar.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   They had all the other stuff and unwrapped the VoIP
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   and let us just do it that way.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   But the Milo's got a phone.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.280]   The Milo is a-- it's a little handheld internet.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.880]   But I think you can do VoIP on the Milo.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.960]   I believe.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.480]   I think you can do VoIP on the Milo.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.680]   Leo, over at the iLife Zone, we did a poll
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   and more than 250 people responding.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   We had 85% saying they either are certainly
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.480]   going to buy it or plan on buying it pretty sure.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.280]   How recently was that poll?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.480]   That was about three weeks ago.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.320]   Because I think the bloom is off the rose.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.920]   Well, OK.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.240]   So maybe it's half that now.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.160]   Who knows?
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.520]   I think that it's still too early to be worrying about it.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.720]   We'll wait till it gets here and then we'll watch everything
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.480]   go crazy.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.840]   For me, the immediate bloom of I'm
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   going to run out this minute and buy this no matter what,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.440]   that part of the bloom is off the rose.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.400]   But I think it's going to be interesting when they wrap back
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.080]   around and as the date approaches and we start hearing
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.440]   more locked in functionality that we can count on,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.880]   there's going to be a huge second wave as they say, yes,
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.520]   we will do this or we won't do that.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.400]   And people will really be able to make a buying decision
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.920]   at that point.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.800]   And I just want to underline what I just said.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.880]   With the Milo, it says here, you can use an 802.11b
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   and you are able to chat, talk, and share files
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.360]   with your friends from any open Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.720]   But they don't say VoIP necessarily.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.800]   No, but I mean, what operating system is it?
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.880]   I mean, you know, is it--
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.400]   I don't know.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.760]   Yes, see, it's got to be a real OS for Skype to work.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.200]   It can't just be, you know, Sony OS.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.240]   Now, see, here's the question.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.320]   Are we going to be able to use the Wi-Fi network on the iPhone
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.480]   to access various VoIP services?
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.120]   And if we are, why would we need to do any of the data
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.760]   services?
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.320]   Well, what I'm saying is, is that, I mean,
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.840]   are you talking about the Milo or the Mac?
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.240]   With the iPhone, the thing is the VoIP services
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.520]   are going to be shut down.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.000]   So you're not going to be able to use Skype on an iPhone.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.720]   Oh, I mean, that's part of the singular--
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.160]   that's part of singular being involved,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.440]   is that we're not going to be able to use VoIP.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.400]   And as it's kind of sunk in, I've realized that I don't--
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.280]   I would get a cheaper phone if I had a Wi-Fi enabled--
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.720]   I, whatever they want to call it.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.680]   You know, an iPod that has everything with the iPhone,
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.000]   I'm far more excited about everything else on the iPhone
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.240]   than I am about calling people.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.480]   And to be honest, I'd rather have that option
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   given that, for instance, San Francisco
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.240]   is going to be Wi-Fi enabled all the way through the entire city.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.720]   In any other city, I can walk within 150 feet of a Starbucks.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.440]   I have to throw a little mud into your ferry dust here,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.800]   though.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.840]   There's a couple of problems.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.240]   First of all, it's only going to be 300k, not fast enough,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.000]   I don't think, and almost certainly not
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   fast enough for VoIP.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.880]   Second of all, you've got to have a fast enough processor
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.920]   in these handheld devices to do Skype or some sort of VoIP.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.440]   And that's highly unlikely.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.160]   What did you get that number on the--
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.840]   That's what they were saying.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   No, I haven't seen the latest.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.160]   Yeah, and the reason--
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.480]   Well--
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.400]   Like acoustic modemspeed?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.000]   Not 300 kilobits, 300 kilobytes.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.480]   But still--
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.600]   If it's really-- well, 300 kilobits would play.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.160]   You 300 kilobits would be enough.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.760]   300 kilobits.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.280]   I'm sorry, it is 300 kilobits.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.000]   That's still enough for--
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.520]   Yeah, not 300 bawd.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.240]   That's a-- yeah, 300 kilobits.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.480]   And 300 kilobits.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   Because I was going to say we could see a return of BBS.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.760]   [HONKING]
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.320]   You want to hear--
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.680]   Oh, this is Scott calling from 1997.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.600]   No, I think that--
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.040]   You're going to see that a lot in municipal Wi-Fi.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.000]   That's a way of kind of appeasing all of the competing forces.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.800]   Well, we'll give you enough bandwidth.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.440]   A capping that.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.960]   A capping that way we don't let you get.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.720]   Anyway, that's what I'd heard.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.400]   But that's a while ago.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.920]   I don't know what the actual implementation is going to be.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.520]   You want to hear the leaked Apple Super Bowl commercial?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.280]   That never ran.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.640]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.640]   70% of all feature films are headed up to that.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   60% of all recording studios using Apple Super Bowl.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.240]   This is Apple.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.040]   This is the worst ahead.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.480]   Apple would never do this.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.960]   I think it's a fake.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.000]   99% of all accountants use a PC.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.720]   Of course, it's a fake.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.000]   But this came out before the Super Bowl.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.760]   Like a day before.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.320]   Think different.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.600]   And it has the old Apple logo.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.840]   It has to be hideous to blame.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.320]   Lame.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.360]   Come on, guys.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.480]   Lame, I say.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.680]   It's like that did you see the invitation to the Apple event
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.160]   that went out?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.880]   It was Apple event February 1st.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.640]   First of all, they were using the wrong font.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.920]   What Apple uses, "Mereate" or--
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.280]   I can't remember.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.560]   "Mereate," yeah.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.600]   They beveled the Apple logo.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.200]   It was like some cheesy Photoshop thing.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.640]   And everybody believed it.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.240]   Well, if none of us got the invitation,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.400]   we know it's not real.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.520]   That's what I said.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.360]   I guess if Leo hasn't got the invitation.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.000]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.200]   Whoa, hope, hope.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.080]   We just wait.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.760]   I always just wait.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.440]   I know if it's real when they say the best event.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   I'll tell you about it.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.400]   I'm like, has Leo gotten an invitation?
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.680]   I get a lot more fake invitations.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.360]   I only get to go to the Apple events
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.840]   when Leo gets an invitation.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.240]   I should get an invitation.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.120]   I showed three amax on the Regis and Kelly.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.880]   That I deserve an invitation now.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.160]   Can we talk about your white lab coat?
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.760]   It wasn't my idea.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.640]   And also, it was 54.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.840]   I'm a 46.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.960]   So I felt like a sausage in a lab coat.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.760]   He looked a little beggars in there, Leo.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.200]   It wasn't a good look.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.920]   They said, we got you the big one.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   But remember, I brought worst.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   This is Regis and Kelly.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.000]   These people are size zeros.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.760]   I mean, the big one is for Merlin.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.680]   I'm sure Regis was like, hey, I get it.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   Well, Regis can swim.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.520]   I could swim in that.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   They'd end up being Pat Sejak, who
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   looks uncannily like Regis.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.600]   It's kind of a weird--
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.400]   I think it's the same height.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.720]   I think that's why they use him,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   because they don't have to redo the lights.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.280]   He's the same height.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.000]   So those spotlights are right where they're supposed to be.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.240]   And I mean, my gosh, they had three,
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.200]   count them three commercial breaks during your TV segment.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.640]   And you were talking about six TVs.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.800]   Oh, I had more than that.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.240]   I had to--
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.560]   Well, I mean, I'm just saying, it felt like about every two TVs.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.280]   We got a commercial.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.200]   That's always what it is.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   I mean, that's just the way it is.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.640]   That's normal.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.840]   But you were great.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.320]   You were great.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.600]   Thank you.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.920]   Even with the lab coat.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.080]   Wasn't even my idea.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.960]   Other than you looked a little beggars, you were fine.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.320]   I liked the lab coat, because I thought, well,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.240]   I don't at least don't have to wear a wardrobe.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.920]   I don't wear whatever I'm wearing.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.320]   What is this "wisher" thing?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.200]   Have you looked at this on the--
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.280]   people sent us links, by the way, and you can too,
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.520]   by tagging on delicious MBW ideas.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:44.000]   And T8's 817 has tagged something free Wi-Fi anywhere
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   from wisher.com.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.800]   You guys obviously didn't see it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.680]   That's why I'm stalling.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.240]   So you saw it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320]   Is this little dongle that you plug in?
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.440]   No hardware to purchase.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.400]   It works with any Wi-Fi device.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.960]   Because there was a thing buzzing around.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.120]   It looks like a little bit of it.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   It's a result of a project that I love.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.600]   I think the idea is it's a mesh kind of a--
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.680]   Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.600]   The phone device.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.160]   Or then there's another group doing another mesh.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.000]   What is the name of it?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.800]   I just read about it in the times of all places.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.680]   It's kind of a good idea.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.480]   People are pointing out that municipal Wi-Fi--
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.400]   is expecting municipal Wi-Fi to give people internet access
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.040]   in their homes.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.880]   It's like expecting to put a street light on the street
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.360]   and having them be able to read books in their easy chair
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.860]   with it.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.560]   It doesn't work very well, which is a good point.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.960]   It doesn't penetrate the walls.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.040]   Yeah, I would think all this hope
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.160]   that we hang on the Google Wi-Fi in San Francisco,
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.840]   I think of a little bit like public transit,
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.360]   where I'm very glad to know it's there.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.160]   But if my eyeball is bleeding, I'm definitely
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.680]   going to call a cab.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.320]   I wouldn't want to count.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.920]   I mean, it's going to be good for being able to move around
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.080]   and have a contiguous connection.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.360]   If you're in the park, it'll be great.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.200]   But I don't know if it's going to work in your house.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.320]   I'm not planning to watch movies on it.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.760]   I just want to go check my email.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.280]   I mean, for me, that's all I need out of the municipal Wi-Fi
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.000]   is just to be able to check my email
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.640]   without having to find a Starbucks, which
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.680]   is pretty easy in San Francisco, so it's not that big of a deal
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.880]   as it is for me.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.760]   I just walk in.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.800]   I got a couple Starbucks here, two or three.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   A few.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.400]   I was wandering around Menlo Park earlier today.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.080]   There's a place up by a Starbucks.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.200]   Where you can stand and see.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.760]   You can turn in a circle and see three Starbucks.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.880]   Manhattan's like that.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.720]   There was a Starbucks with a Starbucks in the bathroom.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.360]   I thought that was kind of weird.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.160]   Yes.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.000]   There's Gate Garber.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.320]   There are four on one corner near my house.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.120]   One corner?
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.040]   Well, he lives near the epicenter, though.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.760]   You live near the epicenter.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.200]   Well, actually, let me take that back.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.720]   There are four on the corner, and then about 100 yards
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.400]   from one of them is a fifth one.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.360]   Well, you should have to go a couple hundred feet
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.560]   without a Dolce frappuccine.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.640]   There's 12 within-- there's 12 Starbucks
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   within three blocks of our office.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.360]   And what's crazy is, is there's still
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   another five or six other coffee shops within the same rate.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   And then more than that, I think eight now.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.360]   Eight coffee shops.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.720]   We did a survey one time because we just
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.480]   thought it was the most insane thing we've ever seen.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.600]   I know you talked about Norway not wanting to do iTunes.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.720]   Because of Apple's anti-competitive stance
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.640]   on the iPod and the DRM, this is a little anti-competitive.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.920]   Apple says, if you want to use iTunes,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.800]   better not switch to Vista.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.760]   Well, if I were having compatibility problems--
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.520]   Yeah, but I think they said don't.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.760]   I think they just said they're not ready yet for it.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.120]   They're just saying wait a couple of weeks.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.800]   Don't you think that's a little anti-competitive?
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.160]   I mean, I think you can make a pretty good case
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.600]   that that's Apple trying to sabotage the new operating
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   system.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.240]   It's just two weeks, Leo.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.200]   I also think it's going to be hard for--
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.760]   I think it would be hard to call it
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.160]   anti-competitive against Microsoft number one.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.120]   And number two is, I think Apple could probably safely
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.320]   argue that the vast majority of Windows users
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.880]   don't use iTunes.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   No, what?
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.400]   No.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.520]   It's one of the vast majority of Windows users.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.440]   Don't use iTunes.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.560]   It's one of the most popular applications on Windows,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.920]   according to somebody, a gadget or somebody.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.520]   Maybe on home PCs.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.800]   But not on business.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.440]   Not on business, but there's hundreds of millions
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.960]   of home users.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.080]   And every new computer sold now runs Vista.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   So apparently--
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.440]   Apparently, it's going to be fixed.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.240]   But still, I think you could say, look, what--
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.040]   So who dropped the ball there, Leo?
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.840]   Was that Apple's job to have that ready for it?
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.960]   They had three months.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.800]   Vista's been out in its ready-to-ship form since November.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.440]   So here's what Apple said.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.040]   Apple spokesman Derek Mains.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.440]   Although iTunes 702 may work with Windows Vista
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.120]   on many typical PCs, Apple's aware
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.080]   of some known compatibility issues
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.480]   and recommends that iTunes customers wait
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.080]   to upgrade to Windows Vista until after the next release
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.320]   of iTunes, which will be available in the next few weeks.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.600]   Has the next release come out?
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.100]   No.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.840]   I'd like to say for the record that my iTunes on my Mac
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   works just fine.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.880]   I have to say for the record, iTunes on Windows has never
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.360]   worked well.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.240]   I get more complaints from Windows users about iTunes.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.080]   It is somewhat relevant to us, too,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.280]   because iTunes is really how you listen to podcasts.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.600]   It's the gateway drug.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.640]   It is.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.400]   The gateway drug to Apple, to Mac?
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.480]   Well, you have to wonder--
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.600]   I think it's a gateway drug to the Apple experience.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.320]   I mean, Alex, and I have to talk about this a million times.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.800]   To my mind, I can't guess because I
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.920]   haven't been a new Mac user for 20 years.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   But I can only imagine that somebody coming into that
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   and having the iPod experience and being able to go by the cost.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.440]   If it worked, my mom couldn't get it to install.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.080]   It's too fun for your iPod, and she
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.360]   couldn't get it to install.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   Let's talk about anti-competitiveness.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.800]   How do we know it isn't Microsoft being anti-competitive?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   I had a good point.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.480]   They used to say--
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   there's an old saying that Windows
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.200]   ain't done till Lotus won't run.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.640]   Could be--
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.320]   I remember that.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.360]   --Windows ain't done till iTunes won't run.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.080]   How could it be Windows doing that?
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   How could it be Microsoft?
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.760]   Well, it's unlikely.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.160]   I mean--
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   Well, Apple has to rely on the SDK, and Microsoft can say,
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.280]   yeah, yeah, this is the one.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.600]   My experience has been it's often
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.280]   QuickTime 7 that's the issue with Windows.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.200]   Yes or no, anybody?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.960]   Well, you guys, none of you guys use Windows.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   Who uses Windows?
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.600]   I'm talking to a rocker.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.160]   Mac show.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.560]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.280]   I thought this was Windows Weekly.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.080]   I'll ask Paul Therat.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.200]   People get mad at us on Windows Weekly for being Mac fanboys.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Can you believe that?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.600]   So let's get the mad at us for being Vista fanboys.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.200]   Don't you love Vista, guys?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   I've seen it.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   That's why I've seen it.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.840]   It's like being a gravity fanboy.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.880]   What are my options?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.080]   No, I'm going to go out and buy a Dell.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.160]   That's going to happen.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.760]   I'm a big fanboy.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.960]   I did speak at the Windows 2000 lunch.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.840]   Did you?
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   What did you speak about?
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.200]   I'm talking about buy a Mac.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.120]   I'm talking about Visual Effects on computers.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.840]   And they sent us some machines.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.080]   I have to say that--
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.680]   And I remember talking with Steve Jobs when he was still
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.480]   at Pixar, he was looking from a distance
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.360]   at how Apple was running its business.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.640]   And he said at the time that Apple missed the boat,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.920]   that they had this 10-year lead.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.120]   And they let Microsoft catch up, catch up, catch up.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.080]   And finally, by '95, with Windows 95,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.280]   Microsoft had caught up.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.680]   And remember, this was when OS--
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.280]   it was OS 9, probably was at--
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.320]   or OS 7, System 7.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.200]   And he said, you know, we blew it.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.880]   And I have to say, something similar is--
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.760]   might have occurred here.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.320]   Vista is in many ways.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.920]   It's going to be as secure as OS 10.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.000]   I'm convinced of it now, having used it for a while.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.520]   It's as reliable.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.240]   It has a lot to be said for it.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.000]   I mean, it's in many ways.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.520]   Now, I'm not saying it's as good as a Mac.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.640]   Any more than Windows 95 was as good as OS 9 or whatever.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.520]   But it's close enough, I guess, that it might slow down
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.080]   that switching, we'll see.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.800]   And so you feel like if you had an opportunity
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.120]   to see, based on your experience previously,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.000]   that it's you see a slowdown in the amount of weird virus and--
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.480]   Oh, gosh.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.240]   Well, we don't know.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.760]   I mean, it's only been a couple of weeks.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.720]   But not even that long, one week.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.000]   But everybody's been waiting for this week is some--
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.920]   oh, my god, there's a zero-day exploit.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.160]   And there hasn't been.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.040]   And I have to say, knowing what's going on--
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.840]   I didn't go on the cruise, but I prepared a couple
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.920]   of lectures on security.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   And it's quite impressive.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.320]   Much of what they've done looks very similar to what Apple did
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.400]   with it.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.280]   Hello.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.040]   Sorry.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.280]   Ironically, my phone doesn't ring when--
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.920]   Alex's toast is ready.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   Yeah, it only rings with my toast.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.280]   You've got toast.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.800]   Anyway, Apple touted at Macworld,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.560]   and I think has been saying in many different venues
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.120]   that there's a lot of switching going on.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.680]   There is.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.880]   Have you seen the growing?
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.000]   I mean, there's a handful of research
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.720]   that's showing that Apple at least usage through a site that's
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.520]   kind of crossing a vast majority--
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.600]   a large number of websites all at the same time,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.760]   and has seen the Apple percentage grow profoundly
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.720]   over the last year.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.200]   I mean, it was 2% or 3% or 3% end of last year.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.440]   Now it's cresting 6%, according to that.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   And as far as computer sales, I don't think yet.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.880]   But as far as web usage.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.600]   And so I think that we are seeing a large jump in that.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.320]   I don't think-- I think it's going to continue to accelerate.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.800]   I think that Vista's cute and everything.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:16.040]   But I think people choosing to--
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.280]   what Vista's going to do is going to force a whole lot of people
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.880]   to decide on what kind of computer they want next.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.760]   In Newsweek this week--
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.440]   And that's going to give them an open.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.000]   In Newsweek this week, Stephen Levy talks to Bill Gates
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.600]   and suggests--
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.800]   I have to give him credit for this--
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.360]   that Microsoft might have borrowed some OS 10 features.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.560]   Gates says, you can go through and look
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.080]   at who showed any of these things first
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.120]   if you care about the facts.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.080]   If you just want to say Steve Jobs invented the world
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.840]   and the rest of us came along, that's fine.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.120]   Just a tad defensive in there.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.680]   He doesn't say it directly according to a Macworld magazine.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.200]   Peter Cohen's writing in Macworld.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.080]   But Gates intimates-- actually, this is Macworld online.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.280]   There is no more Macworld magazine.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.480]   Macworld online.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.160]   Is there a Macworld magazine?
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.960]   Yeah, there's no longer a Mac user.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.520]   There's no on Macworld.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.200]   OK, I'm confused.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.480]   That user magazine anyway.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.080]   Anyway, so--
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   Aes and Snell is not going to be happy with you.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.560]   Oh, you're right.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.160]   It's called Macworld.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.840]   I'm just confused.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.240]   I'm just a porn guy.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.080]   Just ignore me.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.440]   Anyway, he doesn't say it directly.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.080]   But Gates intimates that Microsoft showed off features
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.160]   that Apple ended up copying and shipping in its products
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.240]   before Microsoft could because Microsoft spent so much time
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.320]   working on Vista security.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   Like, we wasn't all that secure if they gave us
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.240]   you how to Apple.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.160]   We knew about it.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.960]   He also says, this is Gates again talking,
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.600]   "Security guys break the Mac every single day,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.640]   every single day.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.920]   They come out with a total exploit.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.480]   Your machine can be taken over totally."
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.520]   He's talking about the month of Apple bugs, right?
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.440]   Well, I'm still waiting to see any evidence of that.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.000]   None of the exploits seem particularly good.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.080]   Apple has been patching those that have any clout.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.000]   And he potency.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.400]   Let's see what he says here.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Here we go.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.560]   Bill Gates.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.280]   By the way, Peter's pretty set with Bill.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.400]   He says, "Gates is wrong, poorly informed."
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.120]   But this is an interesting article in this week.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   And Stephen Levy took some heat for not holding
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.640]   Gates's feet to the fire, so to speak,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.600]   to make some amount of force on the fact
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.240]   that that was untrue.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.560]   And on a daring fireball, John Gruber
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.400]   was linking to Lee's response to that,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.520]   where he said, "I think the Newsweek's online readers
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.800]   are smart enough to understand that Bill Gates is
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.760]   the passionate partisan of Microsoft
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.240]   and to assess his comments on the competition in that spirit."
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.000]   Is he saying that when I've got time with Bill Gates,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.760]   I'm not going to sit there and argue technology with him.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.720]   I'm going to give him the chance to say whatever it is he's
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.880]   got to say.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.600]   Speaking of somebody who's often accused of not pitching
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.760]   the hardballs, I completely understand.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.840]   For one thing, Gates has-- and will walk out on you.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.640]   And he has in the pack.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.800]   He walked out on Connie Chung.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.040]   This interview is over.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.920]   I'm not talking to you.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   You're mean.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.720]   Get out of my base.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.200]   You did a really good Bill Gates, Earl.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.440]   But also, I don't know if this has changed,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.640]   but it used to be you had to submit questions ahead of time.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   And you couldn't change them.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.160]   So I don't know if that's still the case,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.600]   but it used to be you could not interview Bill
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.520]   without submitting your questions ahead of time.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.600]   I doubt Newsden would submit to that, though.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.800]   That's pretty--
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.080]   I never would, which is why I've never
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.720]   had an interview with Bill.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.320]   He came off sounding very defensive.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.200]   And frankly, it surprised me because if you're
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.240]   like the world's second, third, first, whatever, richest guy,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.120]   you don't need to be defensive.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.000]   Yeah, he did.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.240]   He did, didn't he?
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.160]   Yeah, he came off really.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.240]   I would have just cruised up there at the high altitude
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.200]   and not worried about it.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.360]   But you can tell that it's obviously stinging him.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.240]   And it probably has something to do with the fact
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.640]   that every time he goes to Best Buy,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   there's 2.3 million zoons sitting there on the shelves.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.480]   That worked.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.320]   That went in.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   Ow.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.920]   And by the way, I want you to know I'm just really nervous
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.120]   about the Zoom phone.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.160]   How are you scared?
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.640]   Because that's clearly going to be the difference right there
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.840]   of the Zoom phone.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.280]   I-- I-- for a long time, I've--
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:04.920]   don't use it anymore.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.640]   But for a long time, I was using a Windows Mobile 5 phone.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.440]   And I finally gave it.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.840]   I was a T-Mobile dash.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.760]   I finally gave it up about two weeks ago.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.240]   Fortunately, Inokia came into my life thanks to Vox.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.000]   But I-- but I was glad to get rid of it
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.920]   because the day before, it crashed in the middle of a phone
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.640]   call.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.200]   I do not want a phone operating system that will blue screen
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.440]   in the middle of a phone call.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.360]   That's just not acceptable.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.320]   It was a notification or something?
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.360]   What would cost that?
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.800]   It happens all the time.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.160]   I talked to other Windows Mobile 5 users who've had the same thing
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.520]   happen.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.240]   It's Windows.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.120]   And sometimes it freezes up.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.880]   And I mean, it's not-- I mean, you shouldn't have that complicated
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.120]   in OS and a cell phone, I think.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.560]   And by the way, there might be something to watch out for if--
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.320]   Don't say that too loud.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   It's always 10 in the iPhone.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.520]   You don't-- you want a simpler OS.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.480]   It's like your toaster.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.640]   You don't want your toaster to crash.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.080]   You don't want your TV to crash.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.800]   Yeah, but how often does your mat crash, Leo?
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.160]   Rarely.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.560]   OK, so there you go.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:00.960]   Although--
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.120]   My biggest source of crashes is whenever I do anything,
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.680]   I get-- sometimes I get kernel panics when I--
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.360]   for some random reason when I'm plugging or unplugging devices.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.520]   Yes, occasionally.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   I will get those.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.760]   There's almost always a hardware issue, isn't it?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.560]   And now I've picked up this new Pixel Core habit.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.560]   And at Pixel Core, if you're going to hang out and be really cool,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.480]   you've got to never unmount your devices.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.000]   It's considered very unmanly to your device.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.920]   Is that true?
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.400]   Oh, yeah, you just got to rip it out.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.160]   And then take the warning like a man and just--
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.360]   It's like that ad with it.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   It's like data loss.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.640]   It's like the ad on the Super Bowl where they--
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.000]   or even the Snickers and they kiss.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.440]   And they say, let's do something manly.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.080]   And instead of ripping off their chest hairs,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.480]   they should just pull out in the USB key.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.920]   Take your thumb drive out.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.360]   Oh, ow.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   You're right.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.680]   Take it like a man.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   I mean, really.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   Does anything bad ever happen?
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.560]   No.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.600]   Only if you've got stuff actually really open.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.440]   If you've got files open that are reading and writing,
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.240]   you could get corruption.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   Yeah, if it's writing.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.760]   And you know wisdom at Pixel Core is, as long as there is
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.360]   nothing actively going across.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:00.920]   It's fine.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.600]   It's been sitting there for a while.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:02.800]   It's OK.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.440]   We should say, by the way, that this is not recommended
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.200]   procedure.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.560]   You can lose data if you do that because of the max.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.960]   The max is journaled off a file system.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.040]   And as a result, rights don't always happen right away.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.160]   And so that's the whole point of that,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.520]   is it the laid right could kill you.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.160]   Yeah, that's what I wanted to mention.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.600]   But in four years, I've had two kernel panics,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.560]   and they were related to bad nodes,
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.440]   not to anything like pulling out a piece of hardware.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.200]   Mine generally get promoted to general panic.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.520]   Speaking of bad nodes, we've lost Alex.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.320]   Shall I try him again?
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.360]   Let me get back to you.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.920]   Yeah, we might want to call banana here.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.120]   He's having an unknown error.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.480]   Hey, banana.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.320]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.120]   I hear you, banana.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.620]   I hear you.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.120]   Sorry about that.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   I'm a banana.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   I'm a banana.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.720]   You guys, OK.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.640]   What happened?
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.840]   You guys sound like you're all on helium and--
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.440]   We do right now?
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.560]   You got a bad connection, sir.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.840]   I had the connection I had before.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.320]   It's just OK.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.080]   What part will you excise of that, Leo?
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.080]   None of it.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.040]   I like it when you say it.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   We're going straight through.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.760]   It makes me happy when you say banana.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.400]   You-- oh, I get it, Merlin.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.600]   You were under the impression that when you said banana,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.240]   I would like edit that part out.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.360]   I was under the impression that when I yelled banana,
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.880]   we would understand that there's a basically just
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.280]   a problem that needed to be addressed.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.400]   In my capacity as Sergeant Panic.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.080]   So my response is, I know banana.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.520]   Shut up.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.880]   Shut up, Merlin.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   I know.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.480]   I can see that.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.880]   You just get a sample of that.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.840]   So Alex, you're still getting crackling?
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.720]   That's fine.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.040]   I can listen to him.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.280]   Can you go in--
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.120]   Merlin's like next room, right?
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   No, he's right in front of me.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.280]   Should we share a mic like Bill Monroe?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.320]   Yeah, go sit next to each other.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.280]   Like Bill Monroe.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.920]   A little bluegrass reference, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.000]   Who does Bill Monroe share on Mike Witt?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.920]   Bill Monroe's day, if you were playing at the Opry
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.320]   and you wanted to add to Bluedo a solo,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.200]   you'd walk up there and hold your damn mandolin right up
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.120]   to the mic.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   That's right.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.640]   Man.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.480]   I've been to the Opry.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   This is the kind of thing I'm here about.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.880]   I sat on the stage of the grand old Opry.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.560]   It was a moment I will never forget.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.000]   Really?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.520]   What were you doing there?
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.280]   We were doing an appearance for Tech TV in--
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.000]   probably was ZD TV in those days in Nashville.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.040]   And I don't know how, but somehow we got on the Opry's list.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.800]   We went over to the Opry got tour.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.640]   It wasn't the-- what was it?
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.720]   I must say Ryership.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.000]   The old theater was a new theater.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.840]   But you know what they do?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.000]   The opera used to be in a very famous theater.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.840]   I'm going to look it up right now on Wikipedia while I talk.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   But they cut a little circle of the old theater's stage out
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.760]   and they embedded it in the new modern theater
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.400]   so that you can feel like you're still there.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.120]   It's pretty cool.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.880]   I mean, the people who stood on that circle of wood
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.920]   are legendary.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.160]   So I covered-- I covered an award show there.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   And it's a pretty cool play.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.000]   It's really cool.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.760]   And then what was the name of the old theater?
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   I'm trying to find it.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.720]   I'm on grandolopry.com.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.480]   But it was cool because somehow we got VIP treatment.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.960]   And you can sit on the stage.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.640]   And it's a live show.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.000]   And they're very casual.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.080]   It's really fun.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.040]   The curtain's down.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.200]   It's a lot like that movie at Prairie Home Companion.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.240]   The curtain's down.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   They're sitting around.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.960]   They're smoking whatever they're doing.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.760]   And then they go, and we're on in 5, 4.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   And they jump up and they start--
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.360]   [SINGING]
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.840]   And the curtain goes up in there.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.640]   It's amazing.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.120]   It's very fun.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.520]   Is it Hillsborough Theater?
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.920]   No.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.560]   It's Ry--
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.400]   Ryman.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:33.920]   Ryman.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.440]   The Ryman.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:34.960]   The Ryman.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.400]   The Ryman Auditorium.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.000]   It was in the Ryman originally.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.800]   And so they cut out a piece of the Ryman stage.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.680]   And when they moved it to the new theater, which
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.720]   is a big modern theater, they brought the circle with them.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.440]   I've seen both.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.120]   And both are beautiful.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.560]   You've been the Ryman?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.480]   I'm old Leo.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.760]   You're older than wood.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.080]   That's pretty good.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.200]   I was around before Volkswagen's.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.960]   Really?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.000]   No, you weren't.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.720]   I'm just kidding.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.080]   Hitler invented the Volkswagen.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.560]   You know that.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.640]   That's true he did.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.720]   It was called the People's Car.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.600]   And we've really gone down the road.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.240]   Oh, here, haven't we?
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.080]   So anything that happened to do with the Mac,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.720]   in any of the things we said in the last 15 minutes?
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.680]   I ran a Volkswagen that had a Mac in the trunk once.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.720]   Did you really?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.280]   All right, so--
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.000]   I bought some bluegrass off the iTunes store recently.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.480]   Bill Gates said Apple lies in its ads, too.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.720]   Oh, yeah, that was funny.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.880]   What did he mean by that?
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.360]   Oh, he doesn't like the I'm a Mac, I'm a PC.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.760]   Yeah, he doesn't get it.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.040]   He doesn't even get it.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.240]   He says, I just don't get it.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.440]   That's not funny.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.080]   I don't know.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.840]   I'm funny at all.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.080]   Sorry.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   We worked really hard on Vista.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   I don't think it's funny.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.120]   It's good to make fun of it.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.520]   I think he should stick to giving away
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   zillions of dollars in African, let somebody else
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.760]   speak on behalf of his company.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.680]   Well, he will next year.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.040]   That's it.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.520]   He's over.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.440]   He's done.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.000]   Is he really?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.920]   Stick a fork in him.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.440]   He's cooked.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.840]   Yeah?
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.680]   We'll see how that goes.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.880]   OK, are you bugged by the Apple commercial where John
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.520]   Hodgman is the PC and he has to undergo surgery to get Vista?
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.960]   I've never seen it.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.400]   OK, right.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.240]   I don't think the over 90% of the people who use Windows PCs
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.840]   think of themselves as dullards or the kind of whatts
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.480]   is that somebody is trying to that somebody is trying to say
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.560]   they are.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.760]   Well, how about I think Stephen Levy was pretty tough on him,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.080]   actually.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.920]   Well, how about the implication that you need surgery to upgrade?
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.560]   Wow.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.240]   Certainly we've done a better job letting you upgrade on the hardware
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.400]   than our competitors have done.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   You can choose to buy a new machine or you could choose to do
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:31.880]   an upgrade.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.480]   And I don't know why Apple is liking like it's superior.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.680]   I don't even get it.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   What are they trying to say?
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   Does honesty matter in these things?
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.320]   Or if you're really cool, that means you get to be a lying person
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.480]   whenever you feel like it.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.000]   Whoa.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.720]   You know, I think if he would have had a shotgun,
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.960]   he would have shot this guy in the face and pretended to be dick
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.280]   chain.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.760]   See, when people say that Stephen was was soft on Bill,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.560]   you got to understand this guy's foaming at the mouth at this point.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.960]   You should go OK.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.800]   OK.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.280]   And frankly, Stephen does not give up even then.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.120]   He's Bill says there's not even the single slightest shred of truth to it.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.320]   Well, Bill, does the entire tenor of that campaign bother you
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.040]   that Mac is the cool guy and PC.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.440]   That's for my customer to decide.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.920]   Wow.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.040]   This is really more fun listening to you.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.120]   Mostly in the voice of Wallace Sean.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.560]   That's just inconceivable.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.200]   You're confusing that word, but not the convenience.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.120]   I don't even understand the metaphor.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.760]   It's inconceivable.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.640]   Hey, let's do a podcast where we completely like each play the parts of all
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.400]   these people involved and like make that a whole show.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.480]   Oh, you know, we could say today on Mac break weekly,
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:41.600]   big gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Merlin, man.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.040]   Oh, man, the kids would love that.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.080]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.440]   Yes.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.720]   But you have to stay in character.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.120]   I mean, you have to really get upset and, you know, like really care about
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   this stuff like that.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.880]   I'm intrigued, though.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.240]   I know it's not appropriate for this show, Leo, but I'm going to go
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.920]   listen to one of your little Windows podcasts because I'm interested to hear
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.120]   more about your experience because it sounds like you feel like you've had
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.800]   a pretty good experience.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.040]   Yeah, Vista Vista is great.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.760]   I mean, it's the best.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.760]   Is anybody running it under parallels or bootcamp?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   Yes, both.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:11.120]   It's, and as on a standalone Dell, which Merlin would never buy, but I did.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.760]   No, I, you know, I if you're going to buy a PC, Merlin, buy a Dell.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.640]   It's not no, no, no, and that's not a reflection of any particular model.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.960]   It's no, it's just funny.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.040]   The whole, the whole kind of fanboy issue is interesting to me because I don't
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.240]   know.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   I feel a little bit landlocked.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.040]   I mean, I'm a Mac user and that's where I am.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.840]   And I think people, I think the people who call other people, fanboys tend to be
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.600]   people who are critical, more critical than me, but also are people who are on
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.680]   two platforms, people, you know, like yourself who are, who have an honest, Vista,
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.320]   if you will, and to what it's like to use both platforms for work.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.440]   And so, I mean, I don't know.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.520]   I don't have that point of view.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.760]   I haven't, I'm grateful to not have had that point of view for four years, but
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.560]   trying on parallels if you know, I'd like to.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.600]   And I mean, there's stuff about, I mean, there's still stuff about the
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:53.880]   Windows.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.800]   This would be a good episode, actually, is the stuff that we wish we had from
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.240]   Windows.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.640]   I still wish I had Rhapsody.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.480]   I still think it's kind of crazy that I can't given that I, I, you know,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.160]   sit around most of the day at home.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.360]   I'd love to have Rhapsody.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.520]   And that's kind of you're talking about the music service with a
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:07.760]   subscription.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   Yeah, the music service you subscribe and you basically get access to these
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.520]   bazillion.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.560]   We should lab.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.880]   Do you think Apple can't change its relationship with the music companies to
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.240]   do that?
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.000]   You think that they're kind of stuck with this music companies want it?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.800]   Yeah, because they get it.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.240]   It's an interview.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.000]   I mean, it's, I mean, gosh, for users, it just seems like.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.400]   So do we were established that so the Rhapsody doesn't work with zoom, right?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.920]   You can't, you can't go in there and you have to use a zoom marketplace.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.440]   I have tried, they have the same subscription feature on the zoom.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.320]   In fact, that's the only time I've ever experienced it.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.080]   And I agree with you.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   It kind of, I had poo pooed the idea of, oh, you pay 15 bucks a month, you know,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.320]   and then you stop paying all your music dies.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.040]   But you know, as long as you're willing to pay that 15 bucks a month, which,
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.640]   you know, I probably spend twice or three times that every month on CDs or music
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.240]   from iTunes.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.000]   If you're willing to pay 15 bucks a month, you can listen to anything.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.120]   And I, and I still think we've talked about this in the past is that what I'd
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   really like to see is a hybrid where I can get a lower quality version for a
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.960]   subscription and I can get as much as I want of it and I can buy higher quality
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.320]   versions.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.560]   I'd rather buy something that I considered CD quality, you know, not the 128s.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.960]   And I happily pay for those and then have the subscription service that I listen
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.600]   to all day.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.200]   And I really want that one or I want to have more rights to make my own
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.800]   mixed CDs or whatever.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.120]   I pay extra for it.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.720]   You know, and that's something that, you know, I'd end up being a customer of
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.240]   both services at that point.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.160]   But what happens when you get into plays for sure, except when it doesn't.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.960]   Right.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.120]   Here's, here's, here's Merlin's, this can be a Merlin's baseless rumor of the week.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.040]   I think it would be really interesting for some Maverick major label to come in
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.480]   and say, okay, we're going to give you access to this huge amount of our
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   back catalog on that basis.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.720]   It'd be really interesting for them to come in and want to cut a deal like that
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.240]   with iTunes.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.800]   I love that.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.280]   If they came in, I don't know who it would be, but somebody who's got a really
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.640]   deep back catalog, maybe somebody like Warner forward thinking kind of company
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.680]   come in and say, okay, we're going to give you access.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.440]   What are you laughing about?
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.800]   I'm just the record labels and forward thinking just don't really.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   Well, it doesn't cross it.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.360]   Doesn't, I used to work for one of them.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.880]   And I just, I can understand the guys on the ground.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.360]   There are pockets of innovation inside of all these companies.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.160]   So you can know there are.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.600]   Yeah, the pockets are mostly on the ground.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.200]   I have a friend who's a pocket of innovation at one of these companies.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.040]   Well, I think more and more that you're seeing that.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.160]   I mean, I think that the music company, the old, they understand the clock is
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.360]   ticking and they understand that.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.000]   And so anyway, the crazy rumor would be it'd be great if somebody came in and
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.440]   said here, you can have access to our back catalog.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.880]   You can basically rent, if you will, this music, you come in and you pay a certain
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.080]   amount, you know, it's like the opposite of the universal deal.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.920]   Or you actually get money for it or you actually get music in exchange for the money.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.000]   You would have access to like get that stuff and listen to it on your device.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.320]   And for, I don't know, 20, 15, 20 bucks a month.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.880]   Great.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.960]   I do find that the problem is is that for 15 or $20 a month, you really need
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.720]   everyone to play.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.800]   Well, and that's, yeah, you get that with Rhapsody.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.520]   You get a million songs or zoom, you get a million songs.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.400]   I mean, that's nice.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.680]   I mean, when I was when I first got the zoom, I just was dragging artists on onto it.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.920]   Just I didn't have to think about it.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.200]   I'm looking at the up.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.160]   I'm happy.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.800]   I would be happy doing the same thing in video.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.920]   I, I, one thing I'm noticing is that right now I'm going through, see, I've
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.320]   missed season five of 24.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.160]   And so my wife and I are downloading, downloading from iTunes one of the time.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   Well, actually three and a time.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.680]   You can't do it with TV because you don't listen to TV show, watch TV shows over and
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.160]   over again.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.680]   It doesn't, you can't, you have to buy it.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.520]   You could, but I, but I didn't say all the TV shows you want for 15 bucks a month.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.120]   That's called cable.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.680]   And a 15 bucks a month either.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.240]   But think that catalog though.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.680]   That's the other idea is like ABC's put a bunch of these really.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.480]   Oh, I'm like, I'm just saying, like we're already got a CBS's download site and see
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.520]   all these shows for free as long as you're willing to stream them.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.360]   But isn't there already a kind of a premium in place for newer movies,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.600]   over older movies on iTunes?
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.240]   Yes.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.840]   That's right.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.600]   It's, it's 10 months.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   So if it was a sensible rumor, I wouldn't make it.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.200]   If it was a sensible prediction, I wouldn't put it on the same source as the guy who
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.400]   brought you the Beatles iPod.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's a new room.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.400]   I got another rumor that actually I've been hearing around probably also
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   from the same source that at least when the Beatles come out, they're going to be
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.760]   sampled at a higher bit rate.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.720]   You think that we'll see higher bit rate music for my tunes?
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.440]   I hope so.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.360]   I would like to know how I can talk about that.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:12.960]   I think about that.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.440]   It's like, you don't like the one you think 128 bit AAC is not a very high quality.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.600]   Yeah, I can hear it.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.080]   You can.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.920]   You really, you can.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:20.920]   You could hear it.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.080]   You hear is where you hear is where you'll hear it.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.200]   You hear it when the song's ending.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.680]   You'll hear if you listen to anything classical, you'll hear it when the strings are running.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.160]   You'll hear it.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.680]   There's a whole bunch of places where you can hear it getting it's beating up the
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.280]   areas that start running on the outer edges of what you're listening to.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.280]   What would you like to see?
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:40.840]   Um, you know, I'd be satisfied probably with something like, you know, one, any two, I'd be
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.520]   reasonably satisfied with.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.200]   I mean, I, when I rip everything, I mean, Leo makes fun of me.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.560]   This is another one of the things where Leo thinks I'm.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.640]   I mock you right and left, actually.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.160]   I.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.360]   I, I, I rip myself at one at three, twenty.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.600]   He's Alex.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.680]   I rip everything at three, twenty.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.800]   Well, I just because I'm never going to use my CDs again.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.160]   So when I rip it, I want to know.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.480]   He drips at the highest quality.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.160]   And if you're going to do that, why don't you use Apple lossless?
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.200]   Um, because then I don't know where I'll be.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.640]   I mean, by doing an MP3 that's that's three, twenty, I can play it anywhere.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.480]   You know, I can put it on any, any device that plays MP3.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.800]   If I do Apple lossless, I'm not sure.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.480]   We'll use flak then.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.160]   FLAC.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:15.920]   Oh, this, I don't know.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.040]   Maybe iTunes doesn't play flak, but I don't like it.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.960]   You can get, I think.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.160]   But MP3 players, the question is, is whether if I wanted to put it on some kind of other MP3, or I wanted to do something else, it played MP3, I just want to put it in a general format that works with everything.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.720]   And so then then I know that it'll play on anything I want.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.000]   And it's a quality that that I can safely declare that I can't hear the difference in.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.320]   What do you rip at, Leo?
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.600]   Um, I will sometimes do 160 or 192, but 160.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.560]   I agree that 128.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.600]   Well, see, I rip MP3s and 120 and MP3s really aren't very good.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.440]   I didn't used to notice the difference.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.000]   My friend John Vanner Slice gave me his settings and he's a bit of an audio file.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.680]   And I use his and 192.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.520]   I go pull up my actual settings.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.280]   I want to, if you played in a rock band and then had an amp near your ears, 192 is more than enough.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.720]   I agree.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720]   I agree.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:03.760]   I agree.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.720]   Or we were a DJ Scott wearing headphones for decades.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.240]   Well, I add to that the standing in front of Marshall stacks.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.760]   You know, I teenager.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.080]   Well, I can hear something if you really scream into my right ear, but that's about it.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.040]   So what is the res?
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.000]   Where is the resolution?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.200]   If you buy something from the iTunes store, I was 28.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.960]   That's 128.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.360]   But it's a C is the success.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.360]   Sound better than an MP3.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.960]   Not much, though.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.240]   I mean, I think it's not, you know, you don't think?
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.160]   Well, I think it sounds a lot better than an MP3.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   128.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:40.920]   You know what?
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.640]   I've told the store before, but please indulge me for those who haven't heard it.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.400]   I was walking by Dolby Labs in San Francisco one day and there was a guy standing in the door.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.240]   He said, Hey, come here.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.600]   And I said, come here.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   And we went into their acoustic reference chamber.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.960]   They have an anechoic chamber with rebel speaker, really good speakers the best you can get.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.320]   And he said, I want you to listen to this.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.240]   And now, by the way, Dolby was worked on a AC and they have their own formats.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   They're not MP3 fans, but he played me an MP3 128 kilobit MP3 and then a 160 and a 192.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.400]   I could tell it and then did an AB comparison with that.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.800]   You know, I mean, this was a really good way to test it in a very good system and a very good chamber.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.200]   And I could not tell the difference at 160, definitely not at 192.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.520]   I could tell it if it's 128.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.320]   And I think AAC is pretty similar.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.480]   But if you get to, I think even 160, if space is an issue, but sometimes you're so big now, why not?
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.040]   320 is nuts.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.120]   I don't think you get anything more after 192.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.440]   And the people who are hearing the 128 AAC, can you tell the difference?
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.720]   That's where he was saying he could hear the difference around the A's, like the strings.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.360]   What? You won't hear it.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.000]   If you're listening to rock and roll, you're not going to hear it.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.760]   But if you're listening to things that have a lot of...
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.640]   If you're listening like in your WK, you're probably fine.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.120]   And here's the other thing is, if you do any kind of equalization to it after it's been ripped,
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.200]   that's when you're also going to appear.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.840]   So if you want to bump the bass or you want to bump certain areas of it up,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.960]   it was not designed that way.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.240]   The way it was compressed is to cut off the areas where it didn't think you were listening.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.960]   And so you start bringing it back up.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.760]   That is exactly how...
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.160]   And you start hearing it.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.320]   So sure, it's fine when you play it exactly the way you play it.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.080]   But if I want to do anything to it or...
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.920]   And I do like to do things to it.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:22.080]   But I think the damage is done as soon as you go to MP3, no matter what the bit rate.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.920]   So even a 320, the damage is done.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   Well, there's damage done.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.720]   But I mean, the truth of the matter, of course, that we have to get into.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.880]   And I know we're getting a little... This is audiophile, but...
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.800]   This is a twin.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.640]   But the truth is, it's ruined the moment it hits the CD.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.600]   It's been quantified into these little samples away from an analog waveform.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.000]   And so it's always a downhill slope once you go from the CD.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.240]   You know, the CD... I've had people sit down and play me a CD and then play the analog version.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   And the analog version is significantly warmer and it sounds...
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   It's got an out-of-the-sound.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.320]   I'm just glad we're so deaf.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.800]   It all sounds great to us.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.680]   Well, and see, now we're back to everybody remembers when I got made fun of,
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.600]   because I talked about my LP collection.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.120]   Now we know why.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.600]   Yeah, the problem with the LP, of course, was that it sounded great for the first three plays.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.120]   And then after that, it was just Dean's grant.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   We could do a new show, Macintosh Weekly, with an MC-I-N-T-O-S-H.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.680]   We'll talk about two bams.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.800]   Oh, that.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.560]   That'd be a great show.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.000]   In fact, I think we're doing it right now.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.200]   This is a pretty...
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:28.840]   For all the audiophiles among us, any other stories we should cover before we get our picks of the week?
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.120]   Hey, I got some follow-ups from the stories we already talked about,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.920]   but we didn't really cover completely.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.480]   The Milo does do Skype and Yahoo Messenger.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   Wow.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.280]   I think I had one other one.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.040]   I'm actually...
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.280]   After I looked at it, I was like, "Okay, I'm going over to the Sony Store.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   I'm going to buy one just to test it."
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   It does.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.120]   And then I'll tell you guys.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.320]   Yeah, I'd love to hear how it works.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   I'm going to go buy one.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.040]   How did you do the next show from a Milo?
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.720]   Maybe the Skype would actually work.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.320]   Yeah, I can't be out of the Skype.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.960]   So, next time we do the show, I'll do it from a Milo.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.720]   And we'll see how that turns out.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   And it can't be any worse than what I already have.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.760]   And then the other thing is that when we're talking about this mesh technology, the washer,
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.680]   it is in fact you know, you sharing all your bandwidth,
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.560]   which is really, really cool, except that it's against your agreement.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   It might be.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.640]   In the United States.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.280]   Well, I mean, you can't technically most of them.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.240]   I mean, speak easy.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.000]   Yeah, I think some can.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.360]   I'm not sure that that's...
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.800]   No, speak easy, it's fine.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.000]   But the agreement's for most of the major ones.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   If you're doing Comcast or AT&T or something,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.200]   they're pretty strict about not opening your Wi-Fi up to everyone.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.520]   You know, that's kind of like if it goes outside your house,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.440]   technically you're not supposed to, you know, make it freely available.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.120]   Yeah, that's a pretty common agreement.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.040]   That's been...
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.760]   That's come up and down in different areas in the Bay Area.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.800]   Quite a few times where people are setting up whole blocks with each one of them,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.920]   just turning all their stuff on and leaving it wide open.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.360]   And people still do it and act kind of, you know,
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.760]   because like in my apartment alone, I can get, I don't know, 14 or 15...
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:04.120]   There's 14 or 15 Wi-Fi hotspots that show up and, you know,
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.560]   sitting in my apartment.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.080]   And most of them are closed down, but not all of them.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.320]   Either 17 at my new condo.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:10.920]   Yep.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.320]   Yep.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.680]   Welcome to San Francisco.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.520]   Pretty amazing.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.360]   So, any other follow-ups?
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.880]   No, that was...
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   By the way, just posted on the Mercury News website for the first time...
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.520]   I'm sorry, for the third time in nearly three decades,
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.240]   iPod Maker Apple has resolved a bitter trademark to speed with the Beatles,
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   Guardian Apple Corps over the use of the iconic Apple logo and name.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.760]   The truth's announced Monday appears to finally bury the long-simmering animosity.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.320]   However, the announcement was silent on whether the catalog of Beatles songs
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.600]   will become available for download anytime.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.920]   One of the things that's interesting about that announcement is that it appears that Apple now
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.360]   is basically taking over ownership of the Apple brand and then leasing it back.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.240]   Isn't that wild?
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   But that makes sense.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.320]   Apple is using it, I don't know, is Apple Corps really vital and alive?
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.960]   Do you look for the Apple Corps brand?
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.120]   Well, I think that's the argument.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.560]   But it's interesting that I just thought it was...
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.440]   That's about the ultimate turnaround for Apple to name their band...
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.520]   For Apple to name their band, their computer company after the Beatles, Apple Corps,
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.040]   and then eventually take over the logo.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.160]   According to a research analyst at Piper Jeffrey, he says the Apple paid the Beatles
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.440]   $50 to $100 million for the rights to the Apple name.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.640]   That's on top of the more than 26.5 million Apple paid to settle past disputes with
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.440]   Apple Corps, the Beatles company.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   So it's what we're talking about as it might be a $100 million.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   I would have changed the name of the company to Peach.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.640]   It's a chunk of change.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   That's a lot of money, but it's probably worth it to keep your brand name, right?
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.240]   Because then we can have fuzzy cuters.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.480]   It's finally got a lot of the way, so now that they could do anything they want,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.680]   which opens the door, by the way, is now that they've gotten that out of the way,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.880]   Apple could go the final step, which is to start publishing artists directly,
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.600]   if they wanted to.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.720]   Oh, good point.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.200]   Cool.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.040]   I would have been a complete mess without the Beatles agreement,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.960]   but with the Beatles agreement and having that completely cleared up once and for all,
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.560]   what it means is that Apple, if they wanted to, could become a publisher.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.720]   That's a very good... Well, that's worth $100 million.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.160]   That's definitely worth it.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.880]   Neil Aspen on manager of Apple Corps said,
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.000]   "The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.800]   We wish Apple incorporated every success and look forward to many years of peaceful cooperation
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   with them." That's a big...
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.160]   At least two or three, anyway.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.360]   Well, but it's over, right?
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.720]   I mean, they've got a deal.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.040]   Allegedly.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.160]   You're such a skeptic.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.360]   Well, when it comes to all these...
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.320]   It's not too late, Leo.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.680]   This could still happen.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.120]   I think it's all these...
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:46.600]   With all these...
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.800]   February 14th.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.680]   To celebrate...
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.720]   To celebrate...
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.080]   Celebrate...
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.960]   Good times.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.680]   You know...
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.760]   It's going to be an oversized tablet iPod.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.400]   I'm just going to have a USB port in the minute.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.520]   I'm thinking, "Wait a minute.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.240]   Now, they were obviously working fast and hard.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.320]   They managed to miss the deadline.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.760]   The Super Bowl was yesterday.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.160]   I bet you anything they were working towards that announcement."
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.760]   And they just didn't make it.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.240]   They finally...
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.880]   That's right, Leo.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.360]   They're still really heavily into the QA portion of this.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   This is going to be completely ready by February 14th.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.400]   We need a new tag.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.520]   We have a new tag on delicious...
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.800]   Can we have a new tag called "Mac Break Weekly Butt Ideas"?
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.280]   Butt.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.200]   [Laughing]
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.440]   You got out of the box we've now got from the butt.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.080]   I'm just thinking, I'm checking to see if Apple sent me any invitations today.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:29.880]   No, not yet.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.080]   But I'm thinking any minute now,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.640]   I'm going to get that Valentine's Day invitation from Apple.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.320]   Big event coming up.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:42.680]   [Laughing]
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.000]   Mikhail Gorbachev has asked Bill Gates to interview
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.920]   intervene in a software piracy case.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.520]   Inconceivable!
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.680]   [Laughing]
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.960]   It's inconceivable.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.680]   Against the headmaster of a Russian middle school,
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.880]   he was accused of using...
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.560]   Why is Gorbachev involved with this?
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.720]   I don't know, but did you see that?
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.760]   I have to say, did you cover on Windows Week that I hadn't heard it?
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.360]   I wasn't listening, whether you covered...
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.920]   Did you cover what the Romanian president said about Windows?
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.160]   No.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   Well, he said the piracy of Windows helped build his country.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.120]   Ooh.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.840]   I mean, it was pretty point blank.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.320]   Wow.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.000]   He's like, we couldn't have done what we're doing without pirating Windows.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.040]   I mean, it was...
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:29.240]   Which is a fairly common third world comment that usually isn't made publicly.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:34.680]   No one buys software in Africa and Eastern Europe and everything else.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.640]   No one buys software there.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.040]   Companies need to...
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.840]   I mean, this gets into a lot of what the Creative Commons is...
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:48.440]   What they've been talking about is providing different tiers of how you sell or give away...
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   Your software costs a certain amount in the West and it's free in other areas and so on and so forth.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.840]   Find a way to legalize what's already going on is going to be important.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.280]   But I just think it was hilarious that the president of Romania said in their...
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:58.680]   Just going...
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.520]   "Pyrity...
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.000]   "Pyrity...
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.080]   "Windows has built our country."
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:03.880]   So what?
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.920]   It's a little stealing.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.720]   No big deal.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:07.720]   No big deal.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.240]   So instead of doing software picks, I thought we'd do our Super Bowl commercial pick.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.800]   I wish I hadn't seen the Super Bowl.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.760]   You know, actually, there's a couple you're going to really want to see
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.640]   that was some amazing CGI.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.480]   My favorite was the Coke commercial.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.640]   What happens when you drop a quarter into a Coke machine?
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.160]   Yeah, totally.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.880]   Wasn't that amazing?
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.760]   Just beautiful.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.840]   All of the Coke commercials were outstanding and partly because they weren't full of incredibly
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.160]   unnecessary cruelty and violence.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.840]   I'm not even like a big wuss about this stuff,
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.960]   but there were so many disgusting violent commercials.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.600]   My daughter and I are watching and after about the fifth time,
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.800]   somebody get in need in the groin.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.160]   I said, "Abby, let's start counting.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:48.120]   How many of these commercials play off the humor of somebody hurting somebody else?"
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.640]   Yeah, I can tell I'm ready to become a father because it's all about,
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.080]   you know, these like, what do they call it?
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.520]   Imitative behavior.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.000]   Like the guys slap each other as the new greeting.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.920]   Like, anyway, but the Coke ones were great.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.720]   They were very well done and they were all different also.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.360]   But they were all had this kind of nice positive feel to them.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:08.600]   Another neat thing was some of the best commercials were user-generated commercials.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:13.320]   Those two Doritos commercials were done as part of a contest by, in fact,
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.600]   I read a quote from an ad agency guy saying, "This is scary.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.520]   These guys are very, very good."
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.440]   You should.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.080]   I think that's what's coming.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.800]   I mean, the tools are really eating out quickly.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.640]   And it's going to be really, it really is going to be a matter of the true talent.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.120]   I think a lot of people who think that they can just keep on doing
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.160]   really the crud that they've been doing for a lot of these ads.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.440]   It's time to let somebody else make the damn car commercials.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.840]   Because it's like watching people paint a wall.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.800]   They're awful.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Awful.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.840]   The truck commercials?
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.240]   Awful.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.840]   The one with the truck.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.400]   Oh my gosh.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:45.880]   Yes.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.120]   Because we used to watch the truck being built while the guy drones on.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.040]   I didn't even know.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.280]   I mean, does this make you want to drive this thing?
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.040]   Maybe we're not the right audience.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.680]   I don't know, Merlin.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.560]   I've always heard people were talking about this yesterday.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.720]   My friend Michael was saying that, you know, he's always heard that
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.240]   those are the hardest kinds of ads to make.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.320]   Because how do you humanize a vehicle, you know, without the saying?
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.040]   Well, they're feeling well in the pot.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.120]   You know, like a rock and, you know, anyway.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.680]   Well, you want to evoke you want to, the thing is you want to evoke
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.800]   some kind of a feeling, right?
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.680]   When you watch old, old car ads, they want to evoke some kind of feeling of,
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.160]   you know, freedom and these seem more about like, you know.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:17.880]   What about those Chevy ads?
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.280]   Did that work for you where they're old Chevy's and they're singing the old Chevy songs?
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.000]   I didn't see that one.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   I was playing weed during that one problem.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.600]   Did you just get a weed?
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.000]   This is one thing I know about you from Twitter.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.480]   Um, I, you know, I don't, I don't like to do my own horn Leo as you know,
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.960]   but I have just reached pro status in tennis.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.200]   So it's been a pretty good week for me.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.040]   I just finally broke a thousand.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:40.760]   Thanks.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.320]   It's been good.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:41.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.320]   I'm getting dialed down here.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:43.800]   Hold on.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.280]   Hold on.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.760]   Do you play weed?
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.960]   Do you play the weed, Leo?
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.280]   But I am now twittering that Merlin admits he's wasting time on his weed.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.080]   What is he dialed?
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:55.400]   God.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.840]   So I know I've reached the Nadiro productivity when I'm on Twitter
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.120]   responding to a remark about how I'm productive by using a weed.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:02.760]   Again.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.600]   And now the singularity is near.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.560]   I own you.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:10.520]   So since Alex doesn't have a TV, by the way, that's your new nickname,
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.280]   Alex, I don't have a TV, Lindsey.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.960]   We can't do the Super Bowl ad picks.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.280]   So let's go back to our old standard.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.880]   Alex, do you have a...
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.240]   I was thinking going to Super Bowl and then I instead went to see smoking as ACES.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:23.720]   How was that?
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.440]   Better.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.720]   It was, it was actually pretty good.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.440]   It wasn't great.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.240]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.120]   It got terrible reviews.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.240]   I thought it might be a good...
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.200]   You know what's interesting is that I thought that it was going to be
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.800]   much more slapstick violent.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.520]   You know, just like goofy pulp fiction kind of violent.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.560]   And it was actually reasonably well put together moving
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.760]   with an enormous amount of chainsaws and guns and stuff like that.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.000]   Hey, we should mention that...
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.760]   I don't know if they're going to do this again this year.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.200]   I'm sure they will, but there was a podcast last year with all the Super Bowl commercials on iTunes.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.560]   And I imagine they'll do that again.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.520]   If you go up to youtube.com/superbowl.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.320]   I meant to watch it before the show and they're all there.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.800]   All 50...
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.400]   USA Today has them too.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.520]   Yeah, but I'm just trying to make this an Apple thing.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.720]   So I just wanted to bring up that.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.600]   Okay, okay.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.640]   iTunes, get it.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.680]   You know, anyway.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.640]   Well, we subscribed to that.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.000]   It was kind of cool last year.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.840]   And it's really the best part.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.560]   More than...
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.840]   I read a study.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.480]   This is more than half of the people who watch the Super Bowl watch it for the ads.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:17.880]   Not the game.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.040]   Well, what's the question?
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.400]   What happens to the ratings of the Super Bowl
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.920]   when everyone can always get the ads?
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.640]   Right.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.080]   Well, the ads weren't that good this year.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:27.640]   I think they were not.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.480]   You were really disappointing.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.320]   Kevin Rose was in the GoDaddy ad.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.840]   I thought that was Kevin Rose.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.320]   There's an extended version of that ad, by the way.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:35.960]   I think it's a point...
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.800]   Yeah, Kelly Lewis is in the extended version,
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.080]   but she got cut out of the...
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.440]   One of them added on the Super Bowl.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.840]   But yeah, and Kevin's pretty visible.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.560]   If you really have fast eyes, you'll see Alex...
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.240]   Yeah, Alex is there too.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.000]   I said then background there, but you have to look quick.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.040]   Oh, Alex, yeah.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.160]   Alex Albrecht.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.720]   Not Alex.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.040]   That's two.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.320]   I was actually inserted in there as well, but I'm not...
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.440]   You know, hey, is it really an honor to be an extra
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.160]   in a Super Bowl ad?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:58:59.960]   I guess it is.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.920]   With a gyrating...
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.400]   Sound rates.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.200]   With a gyrating busty one.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.320]   Sound rate, not for me.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:03.640]   It's ours.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.080]   Nobody asked me that question.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.240]   I get the feeling, I get the feeling, Scott,
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.480]   that there would be kind of an apogee for you to appear in a GoDaddy TV.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.760]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.160]   Paragee apogee, which one is the high one?
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.120]   Wasn't that the high one?
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.800]   Is Paragee the high one or the apogee?
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.280]   Apogee is the high one.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.800]   Okay, I just had a check.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.120]   I was looking at my NASA dictionary.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.320]   Space walks.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.720]   All right, come on.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.520]   Software.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.440]   Alex Lingzi, you're the pick of the week.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.240]   Okay, my pick for the week, because I'm just starting to play with it.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.760]   So I don't have anything that I've been using for a lot.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.880]   Because I used up...
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.480]   You missed it Leo last week.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.520]   I had one for $699.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.000]   Oh, that's two Alex units, right?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.360]   No, it's one.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.400]   It's one Alex unit.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.240]   It's just a dollar under an Alex.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.280]   A penny.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:52.840]   Oh, a penny.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.960]   It's $699.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.000]   Nice.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.520]   This week, way to bring it in under price.
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:58.840]   No, no.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.200]   That's like the ultimate price is right.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   You know, I mean, I just hit it right on the money.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.320]   And if anyone's out there listening to me thinking about how much you should charge to your software,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.480]   $700.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.640]   So anyway, so this one unfortunately falls way short of that.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.960]   I know it's going to be disappointing from any of our listeners.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.320]   This one is not $700.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.200]   It's not even close.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.800]   So this product I haven't started to play with is called you a Jimbo.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.240]   I love you Jimbo.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.440]   Love you Jimbo.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.800]   So and you can.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.840]   But you know, there's a battle.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.800]   Let's see your Jimbo.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.640]   Yeah, it's kind of a it's it's a way to and we're going to probably tell me more about it
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.080]   than I know already, but it's it's the ability to you're able to organize a lot of just this
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.840]   random data that you're I know it's just something I find that I'm dealing with a lot,
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.720]   where I have all this stuff from web pages and stuff that I'm writing.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.760]   It's a notebook app.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.280]   And it's and it's so far and it's got it is, you know, I found it to be
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.520]   fairly useful.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.400]   I mean, and I know that my my my wife got it too.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.560]   And she she's found it extremely useful.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.920]   Like she's just using it all the time.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.520]   So I bought it almost immediately.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.160]   It's from bare-bound software that people do and maybe at it.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.040]   And so it's $39.99 for I think a single one is one one one 20th of an Alex unit.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.320]   It's yeah, it's very small.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.680]   It's a very it's a very it's a bit of hit with the kids in the productivity area.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.720]   It's very easy to use.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.560]   It interacts very nicely through services.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.680]   So there's all kinds of ways if you enjoy things like wait for it.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.760]   You know, it's very easy to use.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.200]   It syncs with your .Mac.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.000]   And if you're actually just we'll just plug for the our our big brother.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.120]   Others, a Mac break segment I did interviewing one of the folks from their bones talking about
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:32.600]   this.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.320]   It's a terrific app.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.960]   And it's a I do you use it right now, Leo?
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.760]   Two features to look for when you print to PDF once you've installed your jimbo,
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.920]   you can print a PDF to your jimbo, which makes it very quick to get stuff in there.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.200]   And then there is an excellent mail script for Apple Mail that I use act on with
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.120]   so that I can in one keystroke just take an email and send it to your jimbo.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.440]   And that's the kind of thing you do.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.240]   Now here's the bad the battle that goes on over your jimbo is.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.520]   Folders.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:08.120]   It there is something almost religious in bare bones software unwillingness to add.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:08.760]   Adam it.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.560]   They're adamant.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.240]   They won't add hierarchical folders.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.240]   There's there's one layer level of folders.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.280]   You can't nest folders.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.840]   And if you look at the mailing list, which I subscribe to pretty much every day,
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   somebody says, hey, I got an idea.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.200]   What about hierarchical folders?
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:27.320]   And they say, no, no, we won't do it.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.720]   And I asked him when I went over there, I said, how come?
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.960]   And they was like, I almost threw something at me.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.240]   They just so sick of hearing that, but it's about some sort of purity thing.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.040]   I don't understand.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.440]   If your life is so complicated that you need high hierarchy folders, you should simplify.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.640]   I think that I think they would say I suspect that they would say that the latest release,
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.880]   which very handily adds tagging functionality would help take care of some of that.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.840]   And it has a smart group functionality that's pretty easy to use as a result.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.440]   And they added that.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:52.600]   Right.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.640]   So it's crazy making.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.520]   If you're used to thinking about like, okay, here's an area called work.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.440]   And inside of work, there are projects that I'm working on.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.640]   And inside of those projects are, I mean, that's kind of the way you start to think
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.760]   when you organize stuff.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.040]   They don't want you to think that way.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.720]   And there is, I mean, there's global search.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.240]   And because of tagging global searches of work, I guess you don't have to have folders.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.520]   It's a great repository.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.560]   And so I still use it despite the lack of it's just funny that
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.320]   it's rare that you'll see a developer.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.200]   Most of the time developers cave to users eventually.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.320]   I think every developer has got something that you eventually discover they're really attached to.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.640]   And sometimes it's something that's really sensible.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.400]   And other times it's something that's just almost like a superstition.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.280]   Something and not necessarily what's happening here,
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.680]   but almost every developer, like the developer or scrivener is very adamant about certain things.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.760]   Developer of textmate that I love, he's like, Alan is like, we're never going to have a full screen mode.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.640]   That is all really.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.600]   And yeah, and everybody's like the Ethan who made Kingclas is like, we are going to do GTD this way.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.560]   That is all right.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.000]   And in a way, that's kind of what you do.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.120]   When you make a good app, you say to people, I'm going to present you with a set of opportunities
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.080]   and constraints.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.920]   I present it in a really usable way.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.440]   And so if you can learn to think like within us, you know, we're not going to let you do this
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.400]   in a conceivable way.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.920]   And that's part of what gives this structure.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.400]   Nobody tells Picasso, can you put the nose on the right?
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:12.360]   So I guess if you think of yourself as an artist, and in many ways, you know, creating a degree,
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.240]   is a work of art.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.280]   I mean, I'm that way.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.480]   I mean, people have.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.440]   You're like that, Alex.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.000]   You really are.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.280]   That way, Alex.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.040]   Alex is the, what can we call him?
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:27.720]   The Alex is like a crazy old man who has a hamburger stand and he'll make you a hamburger,
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.280]   but you're going to have with the egg on it and he's going to toast the bun.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.880]   God damn it.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.080]   This is how it's going to be.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.040]   There is a hamburger stand, the original hamburger stand in the world where hamburgers were invented
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.800]   in New Haven called Louise lunch, and you, you know, that you can't get it with a ketchup.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.000]   There's no ketchup.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.680]   You have to have it with tomato.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.880]   You can't have it with ketchup.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.960]   And it's on toast, not a bun.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.600]   And that's it.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.720]   You know, no choice.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.120]   You know what?
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.560]   It's the best hamburger I've ever had.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:53.720]   So.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.640]   Well, see, there you go.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.600]   There you go.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.840]   Now I had to meet you with someone who asked what you were.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.960]   You're the quick time, Nancy.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.960]   Someone, I was in a meeting today or someone asked me if I could pour the Mac break to
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.800]   Windows New Player.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.520]   Oh, no.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.560]   Did you hurt me?
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.360]   I was no soup for you.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.000]   No soup for you.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.480]   I didn't hurt him.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.440]   I just said.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.600]   Mr. Lindsey, it sounds like you just made a buzzing noise.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.240]   I feel like that.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:21.640]   No, I just kind of stared and said, no.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   Next issue.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.600]   All right.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.240]   So your pick of the weekend, I agree and I'm Merlin agrees that we're all,
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.360]   it's wonderful program.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.840]   It's the only notebook program I use now and I own them all.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.960]   I bought every one of them is Yo Jimbo from Bearbone Software.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.480]   Scott Borden.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.120]   My pick is Yo Bimbo.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.800]   Does that make any do with hooters?
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.160]   Something.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.600]   Anyway, no, my pick is surprisingly inexpensive given some of them.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.840]   I tend to pick things along the Alex Lindsey price range as well,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.920]   but I found the most incredible thing for 18 buckaroos.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.040]   It's called Guitar Shed.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.320]   Save it.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:03.800]   And it's from a.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   It's from a company called Astounded, A-S-T-O-U-N-D-I-T.com.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.400]   I said that carefully as well.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.280]   And I'm telling you, if you play guitar and you have a Mac or you know somebody who does,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.680]   just go get this program because it is a guitar tool suite.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.720]   It's got everything in it.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.680]   What does it do?
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.320]   Is it for tuning?
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.200]   Is it for learning?
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.560]   I'm just getting ready to tell you.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.600]   It's got everything.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:30.120]   It's got a tuner, a chord library where you can actually hear the chords and see them.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   400 chords in the library, by the way.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   It's got a tableture, which is the way you do guitar music.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   If you don't know how to read real music, it does a search and an organize.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   So you can type in, you know.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.120]   Yeah, you can type in some name of a song you want.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.120]   It'll go get your tab for it so you can play it.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   It's got a metronome.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   It's got a thing you can jam with.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.120]   And in 2042 years ago when I was in college, I minored in guitar performance.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.120]   So I was in a guitar, and I was in a guitar.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.120]   I was in a college.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   I minored in guitar performance.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.120]   So I am...
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   Do you still play?
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.120]   How?
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   I didn't know.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]   I'm a fairly serious player.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Oh, well, we got to whip it out.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   Let's hear it.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   Well, I don't have it right here.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   But when you come down to the condo...
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   We got to record this.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   We're totally going to play.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   We're going to be partying in Scotts all the time.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   I'll bring my play.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   Yes.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   I have my Ovation guitar with Babinga Wood on it.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   Babinga?
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   Oh, you got the Babinga Wood on it.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   I'm a bingga.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.200]   Anyway, this thing, I got this thing and I looked at it and I said 18 bucks for all this.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.920]   You got to be kidding me.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.280]   It's got a little drum machine you can play along with.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.640]   You can play along with any MP3 file.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.480]   I mean, I can't...
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.040]   You can't buy a set of strings for 18 dollars anymore.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.120]   So anyway, check it out.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.520]   It's at A-S-T-O-U-N-D-I-T dot com.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.720]   It's called Guitar Shed.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.120]   Looks like they have another program for kids called KidWidget, which is a safe computing
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.000]   environment for your kids with a lot of kid-friendly tools, writing, drawing, painting, flashcards,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.200]   games, music, pianos and more.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   So that's kind of...
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Sounds like a good company.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.240]   It's a neat little company.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   Mine comes from...
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:10.880]   It actually was started by Kevin Rose, who dug a program for the Mac.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.040]   And I noticed that John Foster added it to our tags called IRecord, which was a very
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.200]   simple one button record from your eyesight camera.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.040]   And the comments said, "Well, you know, there's other programs that do this maybe even better
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.560]   and one of the comments mentioned something called Gocker.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.600]   It's a free program from SourceForgeGocker.sourceforge.net.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:36.480]   It is a free stop motion program that works with any camera, including your eyesight camera.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.440]   But it also has a very slick network interface.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:46.720]   So you could put Gocker on your laptop down the hall and then log into it from the other
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.920]   room or even across the internet and watch what's going on in that camera.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.040]   You can get stop action, time lapse.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.640]   It's a very cool, free program.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.960]   And you can even create time lapses from four locations side by side.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.600]   So if you go to the gocker.sourceForge.net site, you can see some sample time lapses created
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   with Gocker.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   And it's...
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.040]   You know, we've talked about IStop motion, which is a commercial program.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.600]   This is probably not as fancy, but it is free and a very cool program.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.680]   Gocker.sourceForge.net.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.000]   So we've gone from 30 bucks to 18 bucks to free.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.960]   Merlin, man, I think you're going to have to pay us to...
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960]   Pressure's on.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   Use your program.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.720]   Well, I've got...
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   I don't have one program.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   I've got two half programs.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   I got...
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.720]   First of all, I got an update.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   These are both messaging programs.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.880]   Let's get the one on the way.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.680]   I think you might have done this one already, Leo, but now that I'm officially blowing my
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.480]   days on Twitter, I'm using Twitterific.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   Twitterific.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.200]   Have we talked about Twitterific?
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   I don't know.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   I don't care.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.960]   Twitterific is a beautiful little application.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.480]   First of all, we must make it clear that what Twitter is like...
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.280]   Just as Jaws was a perfect killing machine, Twitterific is like a perfect time destroying...
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.000]   Twitter is a perfect time destroying machine.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   On both ends.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Wow.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.600]   Destroys time at 8th ends.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   39.95.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:14.200]   Twitterific is by the wonderfully talented folks at Icon Factory.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.440]   It's just a very simple little OS X interface to updating your Twitter and to make it very
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.360]   easy to go in and say things like "explaining Twitterific."
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.760]   You do it in that voice.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:36.160]   And there's my little ding.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   That's a great little app.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.920]   If you're going to do the Twitter, and I don't know how long I can stand this.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.240]   Updated to 1.1, by the way.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   Recently updated.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.360]   It's a very handy little app and you can use it at little window pops up and you can close
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.520]   it and it'll bug you again when there's a new update of your other...
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.240]   What is the appeal you think of Twitter?
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.560]   It's something that I have started to call personality spamming, which is that you have
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.120]   this ability to go out and kind of spread your interests and your things and your activities
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   among many people.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.600]   That way it's disgusting.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.800]   I mean, yes it is.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.280]   But no, the truth of the matter is that it's for people who are in a wired environment.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.640]   There is actually something kind of warm about seeing what your friends are doing.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   That's what it is.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.200]   I think it's actually really oddly human.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.440]   And for people like me who are already using their away message to say like what song they're
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.880]   listening to or whatever, this isn't really so different.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.800]   Which gets me to number two, which is that my favorite IM program, Adium, has officially
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.560]   gone to 1.0.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.400]   So if you go to adiumx.com.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.760]   Now if you need the full on video chat capability, you're still going to want to stick with iChat.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.320]   But Adium is an open source application that has tons of great plugins.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.120]   I haven't updated any lately.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.760]   But it's a great IM program.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.160]   It's got to use this.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   Anybody?
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   Anybody use this?
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160]   I do.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.160]   So it's got the tabs.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.160]   It's got the tabs.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   It's really, really pretty.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.160]   And that's ademex.com.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.160]   It's open source.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.880]   So it's free as in beer.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.560]   Twitterific from iconfactory.com is also free.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.440]   And it's a great way to tell the world what you're doing.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   Excellent.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.600]   Gentlemen, I think we've done another fantastic episode with only 14 rat holes this week.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.600]   I was counting.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.040]   But that's okay.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.480]   That's okay because people love the rat holes.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480]   Right?
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480]   That's our story.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.480]   We're sticking to it.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480]   That's what we're still doing.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480]   That's what we're still doing.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.240]   I just need some reassurance.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.720]   Alright, we're going to wrap it up.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.680]   We'll be back next week with another Mac Break Weekly.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   I hope you will too.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.840]   On behalf of Alex Lindsey, Merlin Mann and Scott Born.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.640]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   So you play classical?
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:47.000]   Do you play like with your little foot elevated and all that stuff?
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.200]   Yeah, I do that.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.040]   But I actually prefer everything.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   There we go.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.800]   Walk on a ticket, you can walk on a ticket.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.000]   I like, you know, I kind of like Neil Young and stuff like that.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.640]   Why don't you favor us with the song, Leo?
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   That sounds like a little ukulele there.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.880]   Hey, can we do the new Mac Break Weekly theme with that?
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.920]   Yeah, I love the uk.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.520]   The reason I got the uk is because they actually said, I went to the music store and they said
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.680]   I said, you give ukulele lessons and said no because it's no point.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.320]   It's nobody needs to actually study the ukulele.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.440]   You give ukulele lessons.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.840]   That might be the only time that question's ever been asked in the history of the universe.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   No, sir.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840]   We like to get laid.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.520]   (laughs)
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.920]   - The guys of them did not laugh at me.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.020]   (upbeat music)
