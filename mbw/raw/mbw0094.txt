[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.520]   the show where we discuss, dissect, and analyze every last tidbit
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.560]   of morsel of information or non-information about Apple
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.720]   and Macintosh we can ever get our hands on.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.600]   And we've got a great team of people to do that for you this week,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.120]   starting with Andy and not co from Boston.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   Hello, Andy.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   >> Hello, Leo.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.720]   Please ignore the pounding.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   It's that telltale heart, you know.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.040]   Just ignore it.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.400]   It'll go away on its own.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.520]   >> Yeah, break it up.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.480]   Y'all just cement it in.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.000]   It just keeps on ticking, doesn't it?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.920]   >> I'm serious.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.320]   I mean, that FedEx driver, even cut up into nine pieces.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.520]   He's twice as annoying as he was in life.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.760]   >> Let me out.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.680]   Let me out of here.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.480]   >> You know why you're down there.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.680]   You know why you're down there.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.080]   Shut up.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.800]   I can't only apologize.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.400]   >> To prevent any police action, we might mention this is actually
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.600]   a roofer on Andy's roof.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.400]   Also, just because I don't want them coming to get you.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.840]   Because I've learned now you can't joke in a podcast because
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   people take you seriously.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.760]   >> Yes, we were only joking.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.640]   >> There's always one person who says, Andy and I come as a
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800]   modding seller.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.880]   I heard it in minute now.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.240]   >> Once again, I'm broadcasting to you live from the glorious
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.880]   Moms Resort and Casino in downtown Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.680]   And we're having a roof put this week.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   >> So raid Moms, if you've got a problem.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.840]   Also here.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.480]   >> Also here, I'm really glad to have them here.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   We should get them on more often.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.920]   The buffet of all Mac knowledge, Mr. Mac 911 from Mac World
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040]   Magazine and the Apple Phone Show, Chris Breen.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440]   Hello, Chris.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.240]   >> Hello, Leo.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   I've got nothing but live bodies around me.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.840]   So I've got one up on Andy.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.720]   Although having a reanimated body in your seller is pretty
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   impressive.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.320]   I think there's some question about whether it's dead or
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.520]   alive, to be honest with you.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.080]   It sounds pretty lively.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.160]   >> Yeah, but in nine pieces, I'm thinking zombie.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> Breens, I want breeds.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   Also with Scott Borne from the Apple Phone Show and the
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.960]   iLifeZone and Girls Gone Geek and about 18 other.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.120]   You're doing a new Girls podcast, aren't you?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Somebody tell me.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.960]   >> Mom's gone geek.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> Mom's gone geek.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.040]   That's the new one, starting Sunday.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.760]   >> Moms, I like the idea.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.000]   Who did you get to do that?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.320]   >> We've got two moms that are very high tech and Leana is
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   going to interview them style sort of.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.040]   So the two moms are remote and Leana is not a mom, but
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.560]   she's going to interact with the moms.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.440]   >> I love that.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.320]   >> It's kind of cool.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.160]   And by the way, instead of saying on my shows, I've found a
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.720]   way to just truncate that for you, Leo.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.400]   Just say from scottbourn.com.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.520]   I've opened up a tumbler account where I list everything
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.160]   I'm involved with.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's just much easier.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.200]   >> That really is a way to go.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560]   Scott, B-O-U-R-N-E, like the born identity.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.280]   >> And I want to point out that I pass a strip club every day
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.240]   on the way to work that has a sign that says hundreds of
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.600]   beautiful live nude girls.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.800]   So there are fortunately no dead ones there.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.080]   >> Thank you for making sure of that.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.440]   You're right.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.880]   What are they?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.680]   >> That's what they want you to think.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.760]   >> And that is Daniel Aaron, who is the author of
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   Roughly Drafted Magazine, roughly drafted.com.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.480]   It's good to have you back, Daniel.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.200]   >> Great, thanks.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   If there's any pounding on my end, I think it's PD&E looking
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.120]   for Jimmy Hoff under the street outside.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.960]   >> Are you in the Meadowlands?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.600]   >> No, I'm in San Francisco and they're doing the,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.320]   bearing the power lines.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> Aha. >> Project all over the city.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.880]   >> Oh, that's great.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.720]   >> 2008.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.480]   >> This is Gavin Newsom's plan to beautify San Francisco.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.520]   First the gay marriage is then the power lines.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.400]   It's going to be a pretty San Francisco.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.160]   Did you see Mr. Sulu?
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.440]   He was one of the first.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.600]   >> It was so cute.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.120]   >> He said, what did he say?
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.360]   It was really- >> Decay.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.120]   >> Huh?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.680]   Decay. >> George Decay, please.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.400]   >> Oh, sorry.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.720]   >> And please, because Andy does the perfect George Decay,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.480]   I thought maybe Andy could do George's wedding vows.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   So maybe a little later on, I'll ask you to do a dramatic
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   recreation.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.120]   >> He got married?
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.040]   >> Oh, I didn't really- >> He's getting married.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   >> No, he got married.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   >> I got married.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   >> Con is going to be giving one of the people away and
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.280]   his best man is a check-off.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.120]   >> Is that true?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.560]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   >> That is true.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.520]   >> That is so cute.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.840]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.480]   >> That is so cute.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.600]   So the Starship Enterprise really was a much more hot and
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.560]   happen in place than we really realized.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.320]   >> It was actually the model for Studio 54.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.600]   >> It's a really real party on there.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.120]   All right, Mac News, the reason Daniel,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.080]   one of the many reasons I love having Daniel on,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.040]   one of the reasons Daniel's on though, is he wrote a very
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.880]   good article in roughly drafted magazine this week about
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.640]   something that happened last minute Friday at WWDC.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.720]   It was like Apple was keeping it kind of under wraps until
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.120]   the end of the show.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.360]   And I think in some ways, not only the most important
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.200]   announcement of the show, but could be Apple's most important
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.600]   announcement of the year.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.840]   In my opinion, eclipsing 3G iPhone.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.240]   It was all about Sproutcore.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.720]   Sproutcore, can you tell us what, in a nutshell,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.440]   what Sproutcore is Daniel?
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   >> Well, Sproutcore is a framework for
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.800]   building applications on the web.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.360]   It makes it easier for developers to do all the kind of
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   underlying heavy lifting stuff that they need to do to make
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   applications that work more like desktop applications,
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   but run in your browser.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.680]   And so in doing that, it's kind of an alternative to some of
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.840]   the new technologies that have been getting a lot of Play
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.000]   Microsoft Silverlight.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.600]   Adobe Flash has a platform called Air, Adobe Integrated
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.400]   Run Time, I think.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.120]   They're all trying to repurpose these kind of animation
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.600]   things to create full fledged applications that run in your
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.480]   browser.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.800]   And what Google and Apple are doing is kind of delivering
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   the same premise, but using web standards as opposed to using
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.880]   and kind of having to install a plugin and running it within
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.400]   kind of a proprietary environment.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.040]   >> Even Java, which is, your son's, but you know, son is
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.800]   open did, is still a little more proprietary than some people
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.200]   would like.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.240]   I mean, the beauty of this is it's completely open.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.840]   So, in fact, Sproutcore wasn't made at Apple, was it?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.640]   >> Sproutcore was designed by a company called Sproutit for
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.800]   one of their own applications.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.480]   And Apple, this isn't actually brand new stuff.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.920]   They announced last fall when they came out with the web
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.360]   gallery in .Mac that it was kind of quietly announced on
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   the Sproutit blog that Apple had been working with the
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   developer of this mailroom application to develop a new
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   application for .Mac within Sproutcore.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.520]   And so they just kind of presented what gallery as a, I
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.200]   think jobs kind of presented it as being an alternative to
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   using IDVD.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.240]   You can now publish your videos to the web.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.440]   And there wasn't a lot of information on how they
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   actually did it.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.040]   But that was, what, six, seven months ago.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.880]   And just recently, of course, at WWDC, there was a big
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   announcement that .Mac was turning into Mobile Me.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.160]   So there's all these different applications and a number of
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.320]   them were built using Sproutcore.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   And it's a newer version of Sproutcore.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.240]   So they have expanded features.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.480]   >> So let me tell you why.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.880]   I think this is really an important announcement for Apple.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.840]   You're seeing Microsoft kind of acknowledge with Microsoft
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   Live Mesh and Silverlight that desktop applications and even
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.000]   desktop operating systems are going to be less important
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.600]   going forward.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.640]   Microsoft, by hiring Ray Aussie and focusing on Mesh, is
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.360]   really saying we think rich internet applications of the
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.560]   future, things like Gmail and rightly and, well, even Hotmail.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.760]   And of course, some of the applications that Microsoft
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.000]   has at Microsoft Live are the future.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.640]   Adobe's doing the same thing, taking Flash and making it
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.080]   better and better for application programming.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.120]   In fact, one of my picks a couple of weeks ago was a
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.600]   Flash-based word processor.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.760]   People are using more of these online all the time.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.680]   And everybody else, Google especially, is saying, look,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.600]   this is the future, is online applications.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.000]   But the thing that Apple's been doing, I think, is very
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.080]   interesting because quietly, while everybody's making a lot
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.320]   of noise about this, they hired this guy.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.760]   They took Sproutcore in-house.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.040]   They have been enhancing it.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.400]   And it essentially is bringing Coco, and here's why it's
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.720]   really interesting, Coco programming, Model View
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.880]   controller, standard framework, Rails-style framework
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.920]   programming, to the internet.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.160]   And it explains why, for instance, they've been so
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.800]   anxious to get Windows users to adopt Safari.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.240]   It explains why Apple has said no to Flash on the iPhone.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.360]   They don't want a closed world.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.720]   Daniel, you point this out in your article.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.080]   They don't want that closed world of anybody like Adobe
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.800]   or Microsoft dominating again.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.200]   They'd like it to be open.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.600]   And I have to say, I think this is a very smart strategy
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.240]   on Apple's part.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.120]   And it really puts Apple applications squarely on
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.520]   Windows, as well as everywhere else.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.680]   Does that seem overstated to you, Daniel?
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.520]   No, I mean, I think as time goes on, a number of you will
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.000]   have pointed out kind of the obvious next step for Apple
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   is to create more applications within .Mac.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.720]   And I suggested, you know, why wouldn't they use the same
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.080]   kind of strategy that they did with the iPhone?
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.120]   You know, making applications available in a central source
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.600]   and doing the same thing for .Mac where they bring in
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   third party applications to either make .Mac or mobile
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.640]   meet more attractive to subscribers or add applications
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.200]   that you could alternatively subscribe to.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.960]   And that's kind of that services software as a service model
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.440]   is something that a lot of people have tried.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.800]   And there are companies that are built all around that,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   like Salesforce.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.840]   But on the consumer side, it's almost unheard of.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.360]   I mean, there's free applications, you know, Gmail
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.800]   and things like that that people can use that are ad supported.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   But very few people have been able to convince subscribers
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.280]   to actually pay for their services.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.480]   There's a few examples like Flickr where they have,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.160]   but Apple is really kind of leading that regard of being
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.040]   able to make something that's attractive enough for people
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.600]   to actually want to pay for.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.440]   Does this--
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   Can I take the role of Alex Lindsey if he were here?
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   Yes, Mr. Skeptic.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.640]   This is a flash killer.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.720]   I hope it's a flash.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.640]   I mean, as much as I like flash, I don't want Adobe
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.240]   to be dominant as dominant as they are.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.480]   I don't want Apple to be dominant,
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.560]   but this is not an Apple specific project.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.760]   It's open source.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.720]   I think Alex tries to see pretty much everything
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.560]   as a flash killer.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.040]   He doesn't like it does it.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.280]   And he's progressed, though.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.520]   He used to say text edit was a flash killer.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.040]   Would this eliminate the need for quick time as well,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.160]   or you would use quick time in conjunction with this?
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.880]   In other words, it's just this exposed kind of the core video,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.960]   core animation, and all that stuff.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   Well, flash is a number of different things.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.520]   The three main things that does animate little ads on the web,
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.400]   since it's used for-- that's kind of what
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.000]   its original intent was.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.640]   And then it became-- there was such a problem
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.720]   trying to figure out how to install quick time plugins,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.920]   or Windows Media plugins.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.800]   And as things went back and forth, Adobe kind of came out
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.400]   with his framework for playing video within Flash.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   And that really took off.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.080]   And it's the basis of YouTube and a lot of the sites
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.360]   on the internet are using a Flash-based video player
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.560]   client because it runs on every platform.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.520]   So it's very easy to deploy video,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.920]   because it was really hard to do it before.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.280]   So that's one other application of Flash that's really popular.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.840]   And then the final thing is creating whole applications.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.280]   So Sprout Core is really aimed at the creating whole applications
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.400]   part of what Flash does.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.480]   There's a lot of toolkits already that
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.960]   allow you to do kind of animated--
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.840]   spruce up your website with kind of interactivity
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.200]   on a simpler level, things like prototype or script
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.280]   delicious.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.240]   Those already exist.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.360]   In fact, Apple uses a prototype in ScriptEckers,
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.960]   I think, on its site.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.440]   On their own site.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.560]   And then there's Yahoo user interface elements,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.880]   which is a pretty cool thing as well.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   All of these are using JavaScript, though, right?
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.560]   Yeah, the Yahoo YUI.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.880]   And there's a Dojo toolkit that does kind of similar things
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.000]   for creating application type things that
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.920]   are done entirely in JavaScript.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.080]   And there's also the 280 North that
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.200]   are doing kind of a similar thing.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.280]   I was going to bring this up.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.520]   Yeah, because we talked to Francisco Tomoski of 280 North
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.320]   yesterday, and 280 Slides was my pick of the week last week.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.400]   And they're trying to do the same thing, which is basically
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.280]   bring objective C to the web.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.520]   Right.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.080]   I mean, that's a different model for doing kind of the same--
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   Cocoa script.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:33.800]   --same thing.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200]   I think they call it objective JavaScript,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.080]   where it's kind of the cocoa model for developing
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.400]   entirely in JavaScript.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.080]   They say that the problem with Sprout Core
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.880]   is you still have to do a lot in JavaScript.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.960]   And believe me, nobody wants to write in JavaScript.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.840]   That's a nightmare.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.680]   Apple's doing some of the stuff in the development
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.000]   of applications in Ruby.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.680]   And then it--
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.560]   --creates the JavaScript for you.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.120]   Yeah, because Ruby uses a lot of--
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.920]   In fact, any Ajax framework uses a lot of JavaScript.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.160]   That's really how you do it.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.560]   So it's kind of--
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.480]   It's kind of interesting that with .mac,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.360]   the kind of started .mac as being a server-side service,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.760]   and it really showed off the power of Web objects.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.360]   They were creating a lot of kind of thin applications.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.880]   I remember when iTools first came out,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.840]   and the first few versions of iWeb,
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.040]   they were creating a bunch of applications like iCards
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.320]   and the online create a website thing.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.920]   It didn't go over terribly well because the applications
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.120]   were somewhat limited, and people didn't quite get--
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.840]   It wasn't obvious how to use all those applications.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.800]   And then it's kind of turned into kind of a syncing system.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.240]   So the .mac has various web services.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.160]   It has some Web objects-based programs.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.760]   But now it's getting deeper in the client end.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.840]   So Apple's pairing the Web objects back end,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.280]   and I believe they use sun servers for their email
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.320]   messaging and Web dev servers for iDISC file sharing.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.720]   And they're putting a nice interface on all those various
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.640]   different server back end things with the Sproutcore apps.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.680]   So what consumers see is this really kind of sharp, nice,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.280]   online app suite that feels kind of like Microsoft Office.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.120]   I mean, you have all these different components of it
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.240]   that all work together and are all kind of obvious, easy to find.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.960]   You don't have to navigate to find the features.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   It's just right there.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.000]   So it looks like it will be an interesting to see
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.520]   how the market responds to that.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.360]   What was there come on to developers when at the--
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.400]   I know you weren't there, but if you were--
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   I guess you can't really talk about it, can you?
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.960]   Apple's come on to developers.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.120]   Yeah, I mean, what was their pitch?
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.840]   Did they say, look, we're going to make this easier for you
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.120]   to write applications not just for the iPhone and for Mac,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   but for everything?
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.960]   I mean, I guess that's the promise of this, isn't it?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.560]   Well, of course, Sproutcore was developed across platforms.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.160]   So the company that created it, Charles Jolly
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.600]   is the main developer there.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   He built it to create the apps that they're working on,
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.640]   Mailroom, and it's a mail sorting application.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.120]   And I thought it was interesting.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.040]   One of the things I pointed out was that the Obama campaign
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.680]   started using it.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.360]   Never were excited about it when the campaign was just
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.080]   starting to get off.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.520]   And then also, apparently, the McCain campaign is also using it.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   I've heard from other sources.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.520]   Oh, it's right.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   So everybody has been using this Sproutcore application
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.240]   that was kind of a secret in the presidential race.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.880]   But that kind of just goes to show that this
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.000]   is an experimental technology.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.880]   This is something that's being used in production
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   in kind of serious situations.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.080]   Andy, Andy, did you read the article?
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.520]   Any thoughts on this and its importance?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.680]   Yeah, I mean, it was interesting in that it made me realize
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.400]   that I was totally wrong about at least one piece of speculation
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.200]   because lately, I've been trying to figure out exactly,
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.240]   what, two, three years later, why Apple was bothering
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.800]   supporting a version of Safari for Windows,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.040]   given that there's really-- I can really comfortably
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.520]   say that there's really no advantage to using Safari
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   compared to, obviously, to Firefox,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.840]   but even compared to Explorer.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.720]   It's just not as good a browser.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.000]   And one of the things that was sort of in the back of my mind
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.880]   is that maybe they're trying to sort of have a sneak API,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.800]   sort of like a sneak development platform,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   so that if in the future they wanted
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.160]   to deploy a local version of iPhoto or a local version of iCal,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.680]   they wouldn't have to start from the ground up
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.280]   because they have all the gears and all the mechanisms
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.520]   for supporting like Coco-based apps already in Windows
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.160]   based in QuickTime and based in the Safari engine.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.040]   And so my antenna I twitched a little bit
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.120]   when I first read about this thinking, oh, there it is.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.080]   It's come to fruition.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.560]   This is actually now starting to deploy all these stuff
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.120]   as OS-independent.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.640]   Then I read further and realized that, no, you don't need
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.480]   a special browser.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.840]   It runs on anything.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.280]   Obviously, I was just making noises with my mouth
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.200]   and I was speculating about that.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.680]   But it does look great.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.840]   When you look at the demo apps here on sproutcore.com,
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.000]   you see what looks like a quick and dirty version of iPhoto
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.840]   that's running right here in Firefox.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   And you almost want to see somebody really try
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.400]   to break Sproutcore just to see how far they can push it
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.160]   before it starts to fail because if someone's,
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.680]   if a teenage friend of mine said, hey,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.080]   I just started learning Coco, here's something
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.240]   that I did over the weekend, I wouldn't question
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.000]   it for a second as a regular responsive desktop Coco app.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.520]   Right.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.880]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.200]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.480]   Chris, Brian, have you been following this
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.880]   at all the sproutcore revelations?
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.560]   See, to me, this is like Apple buried the lead.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:46.920]   This is--
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.400]   Yeah, I really am impressed by this.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.200]   And it is sort of the answer to Larry Ellison's challenge
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.040]   many, many, many years ago is how are we going to put all
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.360]   our apps on the web and make them accessible to everybody?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.000]   And clearly, the response is not to give one company
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.760]   the responsibility for doing all of this,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.280]   but rather do something like this where you've built
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.200]   the better mouse for evidence available to a lot of people.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.360]   My one concern about this is knowing the reliability
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.800]   of .Mac.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   I would hate to see this undercut because Apple
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.520]   can't deliver the infrastructure to keep this live
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.320]   all the time.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.000]   Those of us who've had .Mac in the past understand that their
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.520]   time just goes down and it's gone for a long time.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.120]   And Apple doesn't explain very well what happened.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.480]   It just happens to be gone.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.200]   And now they're going to open this up to Windows as well.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.000]   And I would think they're going to be having to absorb a lot
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.440]   more bandwidth because of it.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.280]   And you want to make sure this thing is rock solid instead
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.680]   of sort of .Mac-ish.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.520]   Here's the thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.720]   Unlike the thin clients of web objects, it's a thick client,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:48.840]   right?
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.240]   Daniel, so in a way, like Google Gears, in fact, you're
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.280]   seeing this now already in Firefox 3, the ability--
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.680]   and Fluid app, which we talked about last week,
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.200]   was Andy's pick last week.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.400]   We're more and more able to see these things work off
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.920]   offline as well.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.160]   Does SproutCore do well if you can't get onto the server?
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.520]   Well, one of the things that SproutCore has kind of aimed
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.880]   at doing is delivering that.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.240]   What you're talking about, the offline work, which is one
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.880]   of the main flaws of a web application is if you lose
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.000]   your connectivity, you're web--
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.880]   You can't do it on the air so far.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.200]   --working.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.440]   So part of the HTML5 spec relates to how do you do
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   applications like this and how do you make them so that they
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.280]   can unplug and work kind of locally and then plug back
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.640]   into the server when it becomes available, just like a mail
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.480]   app or any kind of desktop app would do?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.000]   And that's one of the things that SproutCore addresses is how
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.240]   to accomplish that.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.080]   And it does things in kind of a standardized way.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:46.800]   So rather than this being like an entirely new platform that
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.560]   expects developers to do things the Apple way, this is kind
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.040]   of doing things in the JavaScript way.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.720]   So they can mix and match this with other open tools that
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   create JavaScript apps.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.840]   And SproutCore isn't the only way to do this.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.800]   This is kind of an interesting example that--
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.120]   because Apple's behind it for their own--
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   for the mobile Meet stuff.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.040]   But there's a number of different toolkits that people
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.600]   can use.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   And this should bring more competition into the space
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.200]   and create more attention around that.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.840]   And so the kind of the easy thing to do now is to say, let's
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.520]   do something in Flash because it's available now.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.320]   But there's certainly an opportunity
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.720]   to divert resources like you're talking about,
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.400]   putting this into an open framework so that anybody can
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   develop JavaScript apps.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.960]   Anyone can implement a JavaScript interpreter for the browser.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.880]   And by the way, if you want to install SproutCore and play
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   with it, it's literally a one-line terminal command using
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.480]   Gem.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   And since most Macs have Ruby installed,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.920]   but is there Ruby involved or is it they just use Gem,
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.280]   install it and make it easy?
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.000]   They use the-- yeah, Ruby is used to install it.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.440]   And it also has some--
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.680]   it also makes use of it in the development
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.760]   when you're developing a product.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.840]   You said it uses Rails a little bit, or--
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.240]   Well, yeah, it uses--
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.000]   it uses-- you use Ruby to do some things
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.840]   that you don't have to write all the JavaScript.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   And then when you set up the app,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.280]   then you end up with pure JavaScript.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.040]   So in some ways, it might be similar to the--
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.840]   what is it, the Google toolkit?
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.760]   Or in Google's case, you're actually doing a Java,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.920]   and then it creates Java script out of it, which
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.280]   is unrelated.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.360]   So if you have an administrator account,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.320]   I have access to one, just do pseudo-gem install SproutCore.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.200]   And there it is.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.000]   In fact, the Hello World application
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.840]   is pretty straightforward and looks pretty cool.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.880]   I have to say, I'm impressed.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   Daniel, are you a little bit of a developer yourself?
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   Do you write software?
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.800]   I've done some web objects work.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.600]   OK, so you're familiar with this, the whole concept here.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.680]   What's interesting about the SproutCore stuff,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.920]   one of the things I thought was interesting
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.520]   is the localization features, where you can quite easily
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.560]   set up localization just as you would in a Cocoa app,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.240]   where you just add the localized strings,
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   and then all of a sudden your web app is just
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.640]   available to run in other languages
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.920]   as clients hit your web server.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.320]   How does this compare to what 280 North is doing?
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.240]   When I asked Francisco, he said, well,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   you don't have to use JavaScript so much with ours.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.080]   You still have to know JavaScript for SproutCore.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   Is that your experience?
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.320]   I don't have a lot of experience with 280.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.200]   I was actually referring to them as 420.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.280]   It's the highway.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.360]   It's not their name.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.520]   It's the highway, 280.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.600]   But yeah, it sounds like what they're doing
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.000]   is kind of, they call it cappuccino, I believe.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.720]   Right.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.160]   Kind of wrapping JavaScript in this objective layer.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.320]   Well, their idea was JavaScript and Cocoa.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.400]   And somebody pointed out, that's not a cappuccino, dudes.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.640]   That's a mocha, but they don't drink coffee with her.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.240]   So they call it a cappuccino.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.280]   But yeah, the idea is it's all wrapped
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.080]   in this objective JavaScript, so you're kind of more
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.880]   like a desktop programming environment, I guess.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.240]   I played with the-- what are they called?
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.920]   Slides?
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   Yeah, 280 slides.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   It looks like caenote.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.520]   It's amazing.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.640]   It's amazing that this is happening in the web now.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.720]   And even-- well, even if you look at Flickr,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.200]   you see a lot of interactivity.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   But it's custom-rolled interactivity.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.440]   So it doesn't work like a desktop application.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   And it doesn't use the same kind of conventions
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.880]   that you expect with a desktop application.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.800]   So with things like 280 North or SproutCore,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   or some of these kind of richer frameworks,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.560]   you can actually build things that work just
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.800]   like a desktop application that have the same kind of scroll
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.120]   bars, instead of having-- they're being
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.080]   a way to select items and put them in groups
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.320]   and drag them into folders.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.720]   It works just like the desktop.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.520]   So it's extremely intuitive for users.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.560]   And it kind of draws people in.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.080]   When you make things so easy that you don't have to think about it,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.200]   it's much easier to get people to invest in it
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.040]   and actually use it.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.920]   Well, I just wanted to bring this up.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.560]   I just think this is really interesting.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.480]   It's in some ways you could say this shows a shift
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.880]   and strategy for Apple.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.200]   A recognition, as Microsoft has recognized
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.920]   that the future of applications and even--
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.320]   I hate to say it, operating systems
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.840]   may lie on the internet.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.000]   And Apple is-- all this time, these KG Fellows have
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.240]   got something up their sleeve.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.840]   And very, very impressive.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.400]   I'm excited about the future of SproutCore.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.880]   But enough of that, because I can tell it's
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.440]   putting everybody to sleep.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.160]   So let's-- I just think this was a big story.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.120]   I just think it's very interesting.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.240]   But let's talk about it.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.880]   Well, it's definitely like when you hear that they
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.040]   can be tearing up the streets for the next two months
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.640]   while they upgrade the clay pipes into modern PVC.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.760]   You don't notice until you realize that, hey, well,
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.600]   the web just got a little bit better.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.200]   So it's going to take a year or two
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.160]   for this to really filter in where it comes really reliable--
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   excuse me, really something tangible for the users.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.880]   But you're right.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.360]   I mean, potentially this could be Adam's splitting.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.960]   Do developers seem interested in this, Daniel?
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.480]   Yes.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.400]   Every developer that I've talked to about this
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.080]   has really been excited and really kind of
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.600]   responded with wow.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.120]   That kind of--
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.080]   It changes everything.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Yeah, they get it.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.080]   And so that's kind of a big part of what got me excited
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.320]   about it is I can look at technology and think,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.200]   this seems important.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.280]   But when you have people that are doing it for their job,
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.200]   when they say, yes, this is cool stuff,
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.800]   then let's me know what's going on.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.040]   Well, I go ahead--
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.080]   What I'm most curious about is though,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.720]   Apple had the option of just keeping this technology
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.280]   to itself and just using it to make it.max services
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   shine that much brighter than anything else that's out there.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.080]   Or alternatively, when we get into Mac OS 10.7,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.960]   Mac OS 10.8 really blur the lines between desktop applications,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   desktop OS services, and services
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.160]   that are projected to wherever you are.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.040]   It's the obvious answer is that they
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.720]   wanted to make sure that Adobe, Microsoft, don't
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.280]   get that toehold in the operating system
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.360]   to make sure that, hey, unless you have this proprietary
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.280]   technology that Apple doesn't own,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   you're not going to get the full web experience.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.720]   But I'm wondering how long the debate was inside Apple
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.480]   to figure out what they do with this.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.600]   Yeah, I mean, in a way, they're giving it away, aren't they?
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.120]   Yeah, I mean, that's the best way to give something critical
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.720]   mass is to give it away.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.520]   And there's really more valuable.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.040]   It's really more value to Apple to have everyone else using
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.080]   this than to have this as being their own proprietary way
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.680]   of doing things.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.720]   Because the more people using the software,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.480]   the better it gets.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   I mean, everybody refines it.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.640]   Well, there's a business here, too.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.000]   You look at what Google's doing with the Google App Engine.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.960]   Google's giving away server space and application space.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.400]   And if you have fewer than-- what it was,
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   it was a million views a month.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.760]   It's for free.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   I wonder if Apple plans to do the same thing with Mobile Me,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.200]   that it could be the Google App Engine for Apple.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.760]   And that is saying, let a million flowers bloom,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.720]   all running on Mobile Me.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.800]   Do you think that's the kind of thing they'll do
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.080]   where they open up Mobile Me and let developers, third party
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   developers, use these services?
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.520]   There certainly is a combination there.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.400]   Like I mentioned, between--
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.040]   I remember the state of mobile applications for phones
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.760]   has been just a mess forever because there hasn't
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.160]   been a central place to buy things.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.240]   Prices are kind of all over the place.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.920]   It's very similar to the state of music before iTunes.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.320]   The iTunes store came out.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.360]   It's easier to steal stuff than it is to buy it in some cases.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.560]   And so with the App Store, making it just really easy
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.760]   to publish for developers and market their work
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.200]   makes it very easy for consumers and makes
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.280]   the prices really lower because everyone's paying a little bit
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.440]   instead of a few people paying a lot and most people stealing it.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.600]   So this is an opportunity to do the same thing for web apps.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.360]   They could either--
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.840]   like I mentioned, either make it part of Mobile Me
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.080]   as something that makes it more valuable,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.960]   or have a menu that you could rent
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.080]   QuickBooks for the year for some annual fee.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.040]   And it's not only just the web app that you're getting,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   but the web services so it syncs with your phone
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.160]   and syncs across multiple computers.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.320]   And this is really a key thing that Apple's really
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.120]   in position to do, and that there aren't obvious competitors
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.680]   that have lined up all the pieces in the same way.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.600]   I think we could look back on last week at some point.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.520]   And five years from now, we may look back on last week
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.200]   and say that was when Apple suddenly veered to the left
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.520]   and brilliantly, I think.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.080]   Yeah, I would say to Andy's point,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.200]   that this was not a bad time to unveil this simply because there
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.320]   were a lot of Windows developers at WWDC last week.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.880]   Because of the iPhone.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.800]   So they can say, oh, by the way, while you're doing that,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.360]   we have this little thing over here.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   And then they're obviously excited about iPhone development.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.320]   They think, oh, I can do this too.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.640]   Well, this makes the Mac even more attractive to me,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.680]   or that Apple is no longer simply about the Mac.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:13.960]   Right.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   And you write-- I think we lost him again.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.480]   But you write once for-- let's say you're doing an iPhone app.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.160]   At the same time, you consider now, well,
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.560]   I can also run on Windows in Firefox
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.600]   or in Internet Explorer.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.200]   It can also run on the Mac and touch.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.320]   Suddenly, that's a very much more attractive business
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.120]   to go into.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.720]   I wonder how much this is costing Apple, though.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.120]   They bought the company.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.880]   They bought the technology.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.800]   Is there going to be an ongoing expense for them
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.160]   to support all these developers?
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.920]   Or is this just the sort of thing where there's
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.440]   a one-time expense and now we're just going to reap benefits?
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.120]   If I were Steve Jobs, I would get a little building off
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.840]   in one corner of the Cooper Keon campus.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.440]   I'd run up the pirate flag and get the best five developers
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.520]   he has on staff.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.480]   And I'd say, guys, this is the new Macintosh.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.320]   This is the future of the company.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.840]   Let's be the pirates and do it.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.720]   I think it's that important.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.440]   But can he find within Apple a jerk as big as he was in 1982
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.400]   to run this operation?
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.160]   That's the challenge.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.280]   I think that's another secret development project
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.400]   that they're working on.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.960]   I think Steve moves in with him.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.240]   He moved in with him last time.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.800]   I think he moves in with him.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.320]   I've seen there's--
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.280]   That's finally a reality show that I would actually watch.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.520]   Living with Steve.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.080]   I would watch that.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.120]   He got into the Pixar thing for a reason.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.800]   They're creating an animated character who will take this job.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.440]   Good idea, ship.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.040]   Good idea, ship.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.240]   Good idea, ship.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.520]   Well, I first filled version of Clippy, the paper Clippy.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.160]   This is your feature.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.400]   You need to think of a key line that's something other
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.920]   than you're fired or you're the weakest link.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.760]   There's a piece of crap.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.200]   You should be embarrassed for yourself.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.400]   That's good.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.440]   I invented the iPhone.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.160]   Heard of me.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.000]   Maybe that's it.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.800]   Maybe you have a--
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.720]   It's fake Steve Jobs run the whole thing.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   That might work.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.220]   All right.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.320]   We're going to take a break.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.520]   Come back a week later after the iPhone announcement.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.400]   We've had some time to think about it.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.440]   Some of the negatives as well as some of the positives
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.000]   on the iPhone.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.200]   We'll talk about that just a bit.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.280]   But of course, I want to mention our good friends at Drobo.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.960]   Data robotics, Drobo.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.920]   Feeling droovy.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.120]   We love Drobo.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.880]   Drobo is the--
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.440]   Drobo.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.480]   Hail Drobo.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.640]   Drobo is the--
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.880]   well, I mean, and it's simple.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.920]   Somebody call me.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.320]   Somebody sent me an email and said,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.000]   you guys really shouldn't recommend using the Drobo
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.600]   as your sole hard drive.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.040]   What if anything happens to it?
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   And we're not saying take the drive out of your Mac
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.760]   and use Drobo.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.400]   We're saying it's an external USB drive.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.120]   Or you can use it over the network with Drobo's share.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.840]   And it is huge, but it isn't your primary--
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.440]   it's not your-- but not booting from Drobo.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.400]   It's your backup drive.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.680]   It's where you store your music so that everybody can listen to it.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.480]   It's where you back up all your photos.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.640]   The beauty of Drobo is it's as big as you want it to be.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.240]   It has room for four drives.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.480]   You can mix and match.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.760]   It will add the total sum of all those drives.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.880]   Take about a quarter of it for data redundancy.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.680]   It's fast.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.280]   It's efficient.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.040]   It's easier to use than any other raid array,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.600]   because you don't have to worry about what
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.640]   drives you're putting in there.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.880]   As long as they're SATA drives, you just slot them in.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.240]   Drobo will tell you with a great lights on the front.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.440]   If you're running out of room, it'll
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.000]   show an orange light for the smallest drive
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and you pop a new drive in there.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.040]   You can go up-- what is it?
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.560]   What was the total, I think, 14 terabytes, something like that?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.320]   Of course, we don't have drives that big yet,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.080]   but you could put terabyte drives in there and get four terabytes.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.360]   And now, Drobo, the intelligent and automated data storage
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   device, is $50 less expensive because you're
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.920]   listening to Macbreak weekly.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.400]   An instant $50 off.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.680]   If you go to Drobo.com, d-r-o-b-o.com/Macbreak,
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.200]   I'm not saying you mail in something.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.400]   I mean, yeah, everybody else you can mail in your coupon.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:57.440]   We're talking instant $50 off when you go to Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.240]   This offers good through August 31.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.480]   Don't delay.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.040]   If you've wanted a Drobo all this time,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.560]   go to Drobo.com.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.240]   Watch Callie Lewis's great video.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.080]   I think, Scott, are you doing a video?
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.720]   Or is it Alex is doing a video?
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.880]   Well, we shot some video form.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.720]   I'm not in the video.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.920]   We actually had one of their engineers.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.880]   They hired us.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.520]   This is independent and separately
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.880]   of this particular spot you're reading.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   They hired us to do it.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.520]   And just the engineer is just showing you all this stuff.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.040]   And he's the same guy that demoed it for a minute Mac world.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.720]   And I said, that's the guy I think you should do on video.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.360]   Not the day I like looking at Callie, but I mean,
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.640]   this is a guy who he lives with this thing.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.680]   And he's the one that convinced me to try it.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.040]   And by the way, my entire retirement,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.880]   which is the equivalent of my 401k,
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.360]   which is my 450,000 image library sitting on a Drobo.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.040]   And nobody could pay me enough to say that or do that
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.200]   if it weren't true.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.800]   I'm relying on this thing.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.440]   So I'm banking on it.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.280]   Yep.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.080]   It's redundant.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.760]   It's safe.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.080]   It's best, the best backup device you can buy.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.960]   I love my little Drobo.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.680]   It's a little friend.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.480]   Your little friend in the car-- you stick it somewhere
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.000]   and it just backs up everything.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.080]   And it's just so great.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.120]   I love my Drobo.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.080]   Get it for $50 off right now and learn more about Drobo.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.680]   Drobo.com/MacBreak.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.480]   We thank you so much for their support.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.200]   Of Mac Break Weekly Drobo.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.600]   I love just saying the name Drobo.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.440]   I think I only want to have sponsors that have names
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.160]   that are fun to say.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.040]   Drobo.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.360]   Drobo.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.560]   Drobo.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.440]   It will be too drobo-tizing if you don't do it.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:32.800]   I know.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.960]   I'm almost to all the web.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.400]   It's like fun to say.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:35.920]   Drobo.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.640]   Me-bo.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.440]   Me-vial.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.880]   Drobo.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.000]   It sounds like-- it all sounds like baby talk.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.760]   That's the funny thing.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.080]   The problem is none of these companies,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.800]   with the exception of potentially Drobo,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.600]   none of these other companies will make it
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.640]   on the wheel of fortune because they don't have any vowels
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.320]   in their names.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.720]   Oh, that's true.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.320]   It could have been Drobo.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   Drobo.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.240]   Drobo.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   Drobo.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.440]   Drobo.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:58.960]   I don't know.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.800]   I don't even need Drobo.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.320]   I like vowels.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.600]   I'd like to buy an O.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.520]   Please.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.560]   Several.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.240]   Several O's.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.320]   All right, let's move on to the iPhone.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.280]   Now a week and a half later, we've
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.600]   kind of had some time to absorb it.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.200]   There's an article on--
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.240]   I guess it's newsvine saying what the total--
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.720]   the so-called total cost of ownership argument.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.960]   But we hear this every time.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.200]   All cell phones are expensive.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.600]   If you start talking about the monthly fees,
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.560]   they're going to add up.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.680]   Yeah, only $199 for your 8 gig iPhone.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.600]   But remember, when you get any cell phone,
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.880]   you're buying a two-year contract.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.200]   You're committing--
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.800]   and in this case, probably to something like $60 bucks a month.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.280]   So it's about $1,250 bucks, right?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.000]   So what?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.080]   And we did a--
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.680]   We did a study at Apple Phone Show,
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.560]   and it's cheaper than most of the Blackberries, for instance,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.360]   on most plans that people are going to have.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.960]   And it is more expensive, however.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.720]   This is kind of a cute trick.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.640]   And Steve announced that the phone is cheaper,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.720]   and it is cheaper buy-in.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.560]   But over the course of the contract,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.920]   it's like $40 more expensive.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.400]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   But because that's because--
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.040]   That's because an Apple's not getting that money.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.200]   AT&T's getting that money.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.240]   That's really interesting.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.520]   So they actually worked it out by adding $10 a month
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.320]   to the data plan.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   And it's a little bit more than that,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.520]   because the data plan is a little bit more expensive,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.720]   the 3G data plan.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.840]   But isn't there also no SMS included?
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.480]   No text messages.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   The original plan had some 200 text messages that even--
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.080]   That's a question another five bucks.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.160]   --you can look past that.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.480]   Let's stop the madness before it gets a little crazy.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.960]   I spoke with an AT&T official this morning.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.000]   Nobody knows the answer to that question publicly.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.920]   There may be the very same SMS plan included.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.040]   There may be a differentness as planned.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.080]   There may be no charge.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.880]   There may be a charge.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.600]   AT&T has not publicly agreed to anything you're hearing
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.680]   about the SMS plan.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.840]   So nobody really knows.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   So they haven't said what their new iPhone data plan will
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.720]   include.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   Just this morning, I interviewed somebody
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.080]   from AT&T and they said, we do not know the answer.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.400]   Well, one thing that will be interesting
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.600]   is that Apple has always included mail on the iPhone.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.200]   It's free as opposed to sending SMS.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.360]   And they've made all that--
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.680]   If you're sending a picture, you can't even
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.960]   do it over SMS on the iPhone, MMS.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.920]   You have to do it as an email attachment.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.800]   Which is also frustrating.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   Well, it's frustrating if you have somebody
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.960]   that's trying to send you a picture.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   AT&T sends you this crazy link that you have to type in.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.240]   It's really stupid how they do it.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.040]   But what Apple is doing is pushing you
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   towards the free solution.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.480]   And going forward, there's going to be a lot of third party
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.280]   apps, Twitter and various other IAM apps
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.520]   that will hopefully push us past SMS.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.280]   So obviously--
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.480]   Well, SMS is stupid.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.520]   SMS is a holdover from days when phones didn't even have data.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.440]   But now it's really insulting to be charged 10 cents
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.480]   for 140 bytes of data that's really insulting.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.760]   And if you happen to be--
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   I found out just recently how a couple of friends from overseas
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.280]   texting me, it's a quarter of it's outside the US.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.120]   And I think if you're in Europe, it's
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.240]   something like 50 cents to get an SMS.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.080]   But I don't know if I agree with you, Daniel,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.440]   that Apple is encouraging you to use mail
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.920]   or pushing you towards the free thing.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.240]   Because they make their SMS application look like iChat.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   And I think if you're not paying attention,
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.400]   you feel like you're chatting.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.480]   I think Apple, in that respect, is saying, come on, use SMS.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.280]   It's just like chat.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.080]   Well, but see, Apple's not getting paid for that.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.120]   Not anymore, but they were.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.160]   I know, but I'm just saying--
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.720]   Now there's no incentive.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.840]   Yeah, there's no incentive at all.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.360]   And the third-- and all these things are the kinds of things
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.760]   that we had those $5,000 in developers in town to take care of.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.240]   They can devote-- AOL's already, for instance,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.960]   said they've got a chat-like thing coming.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.520]   It'll be there on shipping day, they say.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.400]   There are several chat-type clients
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.200]   that might replace or completely obviate the need
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.240]   for any kind of SMS.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.320]   We don't know.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.240]   But there's a lot of conjecture about the AT&T side
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.720]   of this deal yet, because frankly, AT&T
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.000]   has not publicly proclaimed many answers.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.480]   I've seen a lot of articles written by people
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.560]   who claim to be in the know.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.440]   But every time I approach AT&T, they say, that's wrong.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.600]   Or we don't know the answer to that yet.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.560]   It hasn't even been decided.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.720]   I don't know how they can write it.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.440]   Well, that's good to know.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.680]   They haven't decided yet.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.120]   Let's put some pressure on them to at least include some SMS
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.600]   messages.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.520]   I know people say, oh, you'll use chat,
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.640]   or you can use email.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.160]   My kids use SMS.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.280]   Now, they're not using iPhones.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.360]   They're on Verizon and other services.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.120]   But they use SMS.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.680]   They don't use chat.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.840]   I think there's a division within the company,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.760]   sort of a battle between the people that say, look
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.720]   what people are paying for BlackBerry data.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.160]   It's consistently more expensive than the iPhone's
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.880]   data plans.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   And they think they should be able to get more revenue.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.080]   And there's other people like, no, we
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.520]   included 200 text messages.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.320]   And last year, we should do that much.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.560]   I suspect they're going to come down on the side of including
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.840]   200, as they did before.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.920]   And then you can pay $10 more a month from limited, which
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.880]   is what I'm doing now.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.400]   Chris Brindy, you use SMS at all?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:14.960]   Rarely.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.040]   And I use it only when I have to talk to somebody who
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   doesn't have an iPhone.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.600]   So I think we still need it, unfortunately.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.960]   My sister is on Verizon.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.560]   And I need to text message her every so often.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.360]   And you can't--
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.280]   you know, what are you going to do?
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.000]   I can't chat her for my phone because she can't do it on her
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.320]   phone.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   And I could push her and push her to get an iPhone.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   But she's locked in right now.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.920]   And she's not ready to do that.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.160]   I think there certainly needs to be SMS on the iPhone, of
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.280]   course.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.520]   And like you were saying, the chat in her face makes it very
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.760]   easy to send far more texts than you thought you were doing.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.920]   I don't think I ever have used 200 SMS messages because I was
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.360]   born after 1980 before that.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.480]   So I don't send in 1,000 text messages a day.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   But since I got the iPhone, I have been using so many SMS
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.120]   messages that I had to upgrade my plan.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.440]   But I think it's kind of a strategy, kind of like Apple's
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:12.560]   approach to flash, is that if you de-emphasize it in the case
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.680]   of SMS, or if you make it just unavailable, as it did with
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.400]   flash, that kind of is a market force.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.720]   It's pushing other users towards using something else.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.400]   So you can send some message, by the way, SMS data is $731 a
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.640]   megabyte.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.720]   Wow.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.920]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.200]   That's a ripoff.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.600]   It's even more expensive if you just send like a one-letter
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.480]   reply.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.200]   Because it's $0.10 per byte.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.120]   That's more expensive than buying a vowel on will of
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.520]   fortune.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.920]   Well, I mean, my--
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.000]   I checked you for the consonants, too.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.600]   It includes consonants.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.640]   My concerns always been what--
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.600]   from day one, when we started talking about the iPhone
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.720]   before, number one shipped, I always said I'm worried about
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.800]   AT&T in this deal.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.160]   That's the place I've always put my focus concern.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.200]   And we got to hope that they're going to do right-byes.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.520]   Now, I was presently surprised with the first package they
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.280]   offered on iPhone 1.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.920]   I'm not surprised at raising the price on iPhone 2.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.680]   First of all, it costs money to build out a 3G data network,
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   and it costs more to use and operate.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.680]   That makes sense to me.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.440]   If they raise the price on the SMS, though, I'm going to call
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.720]   Bufa on that one.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.520]   Because they kind of have us by the short hairs there.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.040]   I mean, there's--
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.360]   Well, I can say, though, they may not.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.680]   I mean, what if some developer just comes up with some super
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.880]   cool alternative that makes SMS unnecessary?
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.400]   Yeah, but there's a standard concept that you never just
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.640]   hand your enemies a weapon for no good reason.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.240]   And simply saying that, oh, by the way, the standard data
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.800]   plan includes no text messaging.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.040]   We're going to pretend that people just don't use it,
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   and they don't consider it to be important.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.640]   I mean, if it doesn't really cause a problem for them
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.960]   to include text messaging inside the regular data plan,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.240]   to keep that method of communication as elevated as
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   anything else you can do on the iPhone,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.680]   I mean, they really have to come up with a good reason of why
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.960]   they're cutting that out, or why they make it more expensive
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.440]   or more difficult.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.000]   And I can't figure out a reason, Andy.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.320]   I've talked to several experts.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.720]   Can you think of a reason why they would have to?
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.080]   No idea.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.800]   Well, you try to sniff out the color of the logic.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.120]   Whenever you're dealing with two different companies that
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.320]   have to work together, this really does smell like phone
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.280]   company logic as opposed to Apple logic.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.360]   So this sounds like something that AT&T is doing,
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.560]   where they have a free choice to charge whatever they want,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.160]   and they're simply choosing to create this plan.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.040]   They better watch out, because--
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.400]   Although it is a little bit in line with apples.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.760]   Oh, we don't use that anymore.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   You don't like it?
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.960]   We don't need-- I would be to talk to IDVD anymore,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.000]   because we don't burn disks anymore.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.640]   And you don't really need a media player on your air,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.440]   because who uses DVDs anymore?
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.760]   So I actually believe it is the phone company.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.960]   But Apple has been known to abandon technology
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.200]   so that it thinks are old and in the way.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   But oh, yeah, Apple doesn't benefit from SMS.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.160]   So the idea of AT&T trying to charge extra for it,
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.760]   I think it's kind of like a--
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.880]   when you buy a car and they try and put undercarriage
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.440]   anti-worship thing on it.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.080]   So I think it's a way to get signed people up, say,
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.520]   oh, here's a cheap phone, here's a cheap plan,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.160]   and oh, by the way, if you want to send text,
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.720]   it's just a little bit more for this, a little bit more for that.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.120]   And then by the end of the day, you're paying $9 a month.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:24.800]   That's classic.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.080]   That's exactly how the phone company operates.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.160]   They focus on the upfront cost.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.560]   And they've got a good one.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.640]   They've got a good upfront cost.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.480]   I think it's kind of interesting that the--
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.360]   remember when the iPhone came out and everybody said,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.960]   oh, whoa, this is a $2,000 phone,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.000]   because across two months or two years of service,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.360]   it's so expensive.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.680]   In addition to being $600, and nobody was saying,
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.840]   oh, by the way, the cost of a blackberry is actually more.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.520]   The cost of a Motorola Q is actually a couple hundred dollars
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.000]   more than the iPhone over two years,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.880]   because the service plan is more expensive.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.960]   But as soon as Apple lowered the price
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.560]   to where it looks immediately competitive in terms
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.400]   of the upfront price, now you have people saying, oh, look,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.360]   the whole price of the iPhone is this.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.040]   It's not what you buy into it for.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.680]   So I think that's kind of interesting,
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.880]   because that was one of the things that I was pointing out
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.520]   when it first came out, is the total cost of ownership
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.040]   on the iPhone is actually cheaper.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.560]   Everybody's kind of focusing on the fact
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.720]   that it was $600 originally, how that was so terribly expensive
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.960]   for a phone.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.560]   But when it did first amount, we ran a post on Apple Phone
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.240]   Show where I listed 17 phones that were available--
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.000]   I will yield the floor to cable sensor.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.880]   --to buy the car for more than $600 at that time.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.000]   Yeah, I never bought it.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.960]   That's a statistic that I just never got behind.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.280]   I don't think anybody who's walking to a store with money
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.440]   in their pocket is comparing $730 on this contract
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.960]   versus $520 in this other contract.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.800]   I think they're saying, this is $199.00 phone.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   I can afford that.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.600]   Here's a data plan that will cost me no more than $60 a month.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.480]   I can afford that.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.280]   Good, let's go.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.240]   Right, and I thought it was interesting
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.520]   that Apple never advertised that.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.920]   They never said, oh, look at the cost of the iPhone.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.680]   This is what--
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.280]   I think that would be a marketing kind of death wish
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.480]   is because people think, oh, $2,000 for a phone.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.640]   I can't afford that over a couple of years.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.080]   But I feel like--
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.280]   That's why airlines never say, we crash less often
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.360]   than our competition.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.360]   We only cost a whole lot instead of a whole heck of a lot.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   I'm pleased to see that United Airlines is adding
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.880]   connectivity for iPods in its planes.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.960]   This is kind of surprising.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.280]   I guess if you're paying $1,000 for flight,
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.280]   you ought to at least be able to watch your iPod
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.600]   or listen to your iPod.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.120]   The connectors in the planes--
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.400]   I don't know if they charge your iPod or not.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   I've seen a number of--
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   I think that I flew on something.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.280]   It was a 777.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.120]   And they have just have ports all over the place.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.760]   It's almost like first class.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.360]   And one of the things that they have was USB ports, which
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.400]   is great, because--
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.120]   Which Virgin has, but they don't do anything.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.280]   So do they-- Scott, you fly Virgin.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.120]   Do those Virgin--
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.360]   I fly Virgin often.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.560]   And yeah, they're powered.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.160]   Those USB ports?
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   But they're just power.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.040]   You can get power out of them, and you can hook things from--
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.600]   I mean, a demo I saw they did it.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.360]   I've never needed it, because I can't get past their--
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.600]   I'm always watching TV on the little thing to come through.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.320]   You can't stop playing doom with the other people
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.200]   on the plane.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.520]   Well, and I chat randomly.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.360]   Because you can chat with other people on the plane.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.040]   Hi, I noticed you sitting in full room.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.160]   Baby, hey, baby.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.880]   Y'all up here in the front.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.960]   So can you chat-- by the way, if you're
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.920]   in first class in Virginia, America,
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.640]   can you chat with the people in the steerage?
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.240]   You can chat with anybody in the whole plane.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   OK.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.160]   There's no virtual barrier to prevent the commoners
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.800]   from chatting with you.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.760]   So the--
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.520]   Well, keeping the common seats are pretty nice.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.720]   No, I'm from what I hear.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.280]   I know.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.320]   From what you hear.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.560]   Yeah, I was in jolty.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.520]   It was a joke.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.320]   It was a joke for all the people that hate me.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.600]   And the last time I flew to America,
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.640]   I went back for a moment just to see.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:13.040]   I counted the drum for a little bit, said, "RO-RO."
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.640]   So the 15.4 inch screen-- see, there you go.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.960]   There's the sign that this is a plane
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.840]   that you're not going to be flying on anytime soon.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.400]   In fact, you just announced that they're
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.000]   cutting salaries, they're cutting employees,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.040]   and they're cutting their fleet.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.280]   But there is a plane with a 15.4 inch screen at the seat.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.560]   And it has a connector so you can
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.880]   watch your iPod video or listen to your iPod music.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.200]   It doesn't say if it charges, though.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.920]   Do they charge you $10 to have to connect your cable?
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.480]   Yeah, $0.10, 150 bytes.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.440]   The Singapore Air is also doing this.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.720]   You can connect your iPod to the In-flight Entertainment
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.560]   System on Singapore Air.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.440]   Let me tell you, Singapore Air is so nice that's the last thing
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.880]   you're going to worry about.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.240]   Exactly.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.200]   LA to Singapore and Newark to Singapore.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.480]   They always do this, though.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.600]   There's always one plane.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.880]   Air Canada had one nice plane.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.160]   And you would always-- you know, as you're going--
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.960]   because I flew air cannon all the time to Toronto,
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.520]   as you're getting on the plane, you're going,
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.920]   please let it be the good plane.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.120]   Please.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.240]   You get on and the seats are kind of gray and you go,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.480]   oh, no, it's not the good plane.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.200]   Well, now don't you sort of expect that stuff.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.560]   I mean, I remember when that was really, truly newsworthy.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.080]   But don't you expect-- you know, my new car has an iPod
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.600]   connector and it goes right to the menu on the car.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.160]   It's not like it just makes it work.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.200]   It charges it.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.680]   It integrates the menu system with my audio system.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.520]   I mean, don't you just sort of expect that now.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.080]   When you get a new plane or a new car,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.480]   the problem is get a new plane or a new car.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   Well, you know what I mean.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.000]   It's starting to permeate the thing.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.960]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.440]   So I've been flying as much lately now
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.840]   that gas is so expensive.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.480]   And now they're charging $25 a bag.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.400]   Can you imagine what's going to be like?
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.840]   Airlines pay $1 a gallon for kerosene.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.720]   Do they really?
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.680]   Get a-- well, I mean, the smaller ones.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.600]   But if you're a pilot, it's terribly expensive.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.880]   If you're an airline, you know, you have long-term contracts.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.040]   I'm thinking of driving to Vegas for a podcast expo in August.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.760]   Anybody want to go?
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.080]   Road trip.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.960]   I'm driving.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.960]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.440]   It'd be fun.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.000]   The reason is I want to pack all the cameras.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.800]   I want to pack the Tri-Castor.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.520]   I'm going to pack the Tri-Castor.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.480]   And bring it all down.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.000]   I bring the whole studio down, basically.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.120]   How come-- yeah.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:23.680]   Will you?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   Let's all go down.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.560]   It'd be fun.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.720]   I'll help with the driving.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.520]   We can have a caravan.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.440]   Scott's got one of them new fangled cars
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.760]   where you can plug your iPod in.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.200]   I can't wait.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.280]   So excited.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.760]   I myself am finally breaking down
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.840]   and having a real iPod audio head installed in my car.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.760]   Because I actually skinned one of my knuckles,
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.440]   punching the auto-reverse button on my cassette deck
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.560]   once too often when I just randomly
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.200]   decided to flip over to the other side of the car adapter.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.240]   So just when I'm at the bit of the podcast,
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.080]   when they're going to give the punch line of a joke
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.240]   or something really important and I'm listening to nothing,
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.720]   I'll press it lightly once.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.840]   I'll tap it a little bit firmly the second time.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.920]   The third time onward, I'm just punching the hell
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.760]   on that dashboard.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.920]   It's not good.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   You have a cassette player in your car, Andy?
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.320]   It's-- again, I remind you that I'm a freelance journalist
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.200]   in a collapsing market.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.000]   I have a car that's very sensible for someone who walks
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.880]   30 feet to work every morning.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.320]   It's like the standard--
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.240]   it's always been like the standard cassette--
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.160]   like the stock cassette player.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   I'm actually buying--
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.800]   I'm actually buying an A-track.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.080]   It doesn't have those buttons where you're pushing the button
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.360]   and the clunking sound.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.320]   Hey, look, Andy's down.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.040]   Let's kick him.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.200]   Hey, I'm just wondering when the gray--
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.040]   I guess, Daniel, doesn't want his free t-shirt.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:44.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.520]   I'm talking about being a guest on the show, doesn't he, Leo?
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.000]   No.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I was going to share my A-track.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.960]   So I have some carpenters.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   Oh, that's different.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.240]   I might give him a Drobo for that.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.200]   Wouldn't that be cool if the Drobo had an eight--
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.360]   like at the top had a little eight-track slot?
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.760]   You could just punch your eight-track in there.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.360]   Because it almost looks like a eight-track.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.640]   Yeah, and then you're reading a file
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.000]   and will just randomly switch to the middle of another file
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.960]   with no warning.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.720]   Chunk is a complete track for it.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.560]   And they get chunks in.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.280]   Little wood paneling on it.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.120]   I'm ready.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.640]   I'm ready.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.160]   I'm ready to putty life knife to keep it working.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.120]   That's where it's going.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.680]   I'm wondering when the grayhound is going
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.840]   to have that iPod connector in the back of the seat.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.680]   Well, there's some nice bus service
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.120]   that maybe Andy's heard of.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.560]   Back on the Eastern corridor, they're sending ads out here
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.120]   for some reason on a why.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.080]   But they've got grayhound and other carriers
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.680]   that are doing New York to Boston
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.320]   and Boston and Washington DC, Philly, with like real nice buses.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.600]   I've actually been meaning to try it.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.520]   Normally, take A-track because it's just
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.680]   such a wonderful way to travel from Boston to New York.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.600]   But there are now luxury bus lines with like, not grayhound
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.080]   buses.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.720]   It's more like your P-Diddy motor coach
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.960]   with like, business class leather seats, free Wi-Fi,
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.200]   free Virgin Atlantic style, you know, direct TV
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.480]   and every seat back.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.200]   It's three and a half hours.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.960]   It costs like about a half as much as it costs to fly Amtrak.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.880]   It'll take you right down to Midtown Manhattan
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.760]   and to the port of 30 bus terminal, at which point
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.600]   you disembark and the luxury ends, I'm certain.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.120]   But it's interesting to see all these solutions.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.400]   Again, the idea of having that kind of an experience
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.080]   for three and a half hours and knowing that there probably
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.200]   won't be some like, you know, college grad student
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.080]   drooling and sleeping on your shoulder, you know,
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.680]   for the three and a half hours, that actually might
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.760]   make bus travel interesting again.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.000]   - Well, I believe they provide catheters as well.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.280]   - I could use one right now.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.080]   I'll tell you what, let's take a little,
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.000]   let's take a little mini break.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.080]   Anybody who wants to go to the bathroom can and--
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.160]   - Just a minute.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   - Go ahead, Scott Warren.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.840]   It's time for a visit with our friends at Audible,
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.720]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.480]   Audible is our source for audio books we love.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.440]   And if you're not yet an Audible member, my goodness,
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.280]   what's keeping you?
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.720]   Why don't you join Audible right now by going to audible.com/macbreak
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.280]   when you do, you could sign up to get a credit

[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.200]   that play of course on your iPod, so you could plug it in
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.680]   next time you fly Virgin Atlantic.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:13.240]   Or on any other, almost any other portable device,
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.720]   your iPhone too.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.840]   - Annie, do you have a recommendation this week
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.640]   or are you tapped out?
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.960]   - You know, I'll never tapped out.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.760]   I'm recommending one of my favorite books of all time.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.600]   - Wow.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.360]   - It's by Jack London, one of the great American authors
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.440]   of the 20th century or any other century.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.800]   It's called The Sea Wolf.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.840]   This might be a novel that you were assigned to read
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.160]   in high school, do not let that dissuade you.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.040]   This is a great, great book.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.320]   The basic thrust of the plot is that,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.640]   really all I have to do is tell you the two main character
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.040]   names, there is this dude named Humphrey Van Wyden.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.680]   Sounds like Scott.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.960]   Exactly, he's riding the ferry across San Francisco by
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.160]   when the ferry crashes and he's the only survivor.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.240]   But fortunately, there's a ship that comes to rescue him.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.800]   - It's Captain by Captain Wolf Larson.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.400]   (laughing)
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.840]   Headed north to slaughter seals.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.640]   - The Captain of one, he doesn't believe that there's
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.080]   an afterlife, he believes that you live for whatever's
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.920]   happening right in front of you right now.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   He beats his crew with iron and broken cuddles.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.000]   He is thrilled in his Wolf Larson way to be picking up
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.840]   this little milk toasted little guy.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.840]   Because the only, he sees himself as an intellectual,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.680]   who knows who life works.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.040]   And finally, he has a way that he gets someone that he
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.320]   can challenge not just physically, but also intellectually.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.040]   - Tell me how much you like.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.880]   - Poetry.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.040]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.480]   He would be the vote on Captain, only imagine he was
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.200]   like seven foot eight and he could like, you know,
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.480]   bend the car in half.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.720]   And so he says, no, hell no, I'm not taking you back
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.240]   to landfall, we've got this, we're headed to kill seals.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.320]   If you want, you can either go back in the harbor,
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.040]   or we can make you the ship's cook.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.200]   And so Humphrey Van Wyden has a little bit of an
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.760]   education in life.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.120]   And it's just a nothing but this physical and intellectual
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.200]   showdown with one of the most brutal jerks
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.360]   in American literature.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.440]   - It's like my first job actually.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   (laughing)
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.960]   - And then I said, Mr. Johansson, you know,
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.760]   you changed that fry meeting.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   You know, I'm saying, it's sanitary.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.800]   (laughing)
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.280]   I'll throw up, give me a peck this paper,
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.120]   how did I get on?
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.200]   I'm going to June, you're calm.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.240]   - How did you know, that was my first job.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.800]   - Hey, it's very nice that we have bathroom break.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.640]   (laughing)
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.480]   - He's feeling much better now.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.440]   - Astronaut diapers, next week's episode brought to you
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.640]   by Astronaut Diaper.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.440]   - We could work on that.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.160]   - So our audible pick, this sounds great.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.280]   And you know, it's funny, I've read the call of the wild
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.760]   and a bunch of other Jack London books,
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.840]   but I never read the sea wolf, I have to read this one.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.840]   - I mean, Jack London, he's one of those authors
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.000]   where later on you realize how profoundly
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.560]   almost every other writer after him has been ripping him off.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.840]   There are so many mediocre books that were created
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.080]   and someone read a Jack London novel and said,
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.480]   "God, I wish I could write half as good as that."
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.720]   And they wound up writing about one quarter as good as that.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.520]   - Well, and then now they've got the rep
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.480]   of being kind of kids books, which I'm sure they weren't
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.840]   when they came out.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   - Yeah, well, oh God, no, sea wolf is not a kids book.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.600]   I mean, his most famous book is of course,
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.440]   a call of the wild.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.320]   And when it's, you know, so easy,
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.200]   when you have a story that's so easily adapted
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.360]   to a Disney animation, you know,
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.720]   it might get that kind of reputation, but no.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.840]   The sea wolf is brutal, it is unflinching.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.840]   I think I read it when I was 17 or 18
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.520]   and it created word pictures and imagery
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.280]   that I still stay, stays with me to this day.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.200]   I can still see, you know, the scene that he wrote
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.000]   where Humphrey is getting used to like his work
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.920]   as the ship's cook and he knows that he has to know,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.120]   it's important that he keep a sharp filet knife
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.840]   at his side at all times, defend against the facts
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.920]   from everybody.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.440]   And so he's trying to manage these pots
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.000]   while keeping a hand free for the knife at all times.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.920]   - Oh, this is great.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.240]   Holy cow.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.800]   I don't want, I am not taking no ferry across,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.840]   no San Francisco Bay, I'm telling you that.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.400]   - Mm-mm, thank goodness they built the bridge.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.240]   Let me play a little bit of it.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.040]   This is from the audible.com's edition
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.160]   of the sea wolf by Jack London,
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.880]   Garak Hagen doing the reading
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.640]   and I'll play a little bit of it for you right now.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.200]   - Let's be ahead and from very near at hand,
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.160]   our paddle wheels.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   - There are a couple of different unabridged versions.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.600]   Brian Emerson also built a good one.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.440]   - Oh, do you like the right?
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.800]   Okay, yeah, this is, actually I should stop at the whistle.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.680]   This is, I think, the abridged edition.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.120]   So there's several different versions of it.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.960]   - Go for the unabridged.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.320]   I don't mean, what was I?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.160]   - Where's I thinking?
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.000]   - Where's I thinking?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.840]   - Yeah, I think I'm crazy.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.920]   Crazy.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.200]   All right, hey, great pick.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.480]   That could, any 45,000 books could be yours.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.600]   All you gotta do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.800]   We really, really love audible.com.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.200]   I know you'll love audible.com,
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.360]   so give it a try and make sure you use the special URL
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.720]   so we get the credit.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.240]   And we thank audible for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.200]   - Let's see, what else is going on
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.600]   in the world of Macintosh?
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.720]   We could do our picks here unless somebody has
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.600]   another story that they think is important.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.440]   Are we?
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.880]   - I might, I might come back to the stock price.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.840]   - What, is it rebounding?
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.320]   - It is and it's rebounding on very strong iPod and Mac sales.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.800]   So when are they announced new sales?
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.080]   - It's, I think it's a couple days old.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.680]   I got a thing from my broker,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.120]   even though I'm not a stockholder anymore in Apple,
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.120]   but they had some sort of analyst walk and walk through
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.440]   and they mentioned some analysis of the Mac sales
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.400]   and iPods it very strong.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.120]   And the call now is at $250.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.440]   They're putting the price at $250.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.800]   - Wow, wow.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   So that's a combination of people wanting to get in now
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.320]   that they know the profit takers took off after WWDC.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.200]   There's always a bounce up after the profit taking.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.280]   So some of it's from that,
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.760]   some of it's from strong sales
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.040]   and some of it's from anticipation over the new analyst
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.320]   numbers on the iPhone at something like
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.080]   9 million of the new ones alone.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.440]   - Well, it's currently at 179, something like that.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.320]   And you sold it, see you still, you sold at the peak.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   You sold it to 200.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.120]   - I sold at 199, 23.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.600]   So you're still ahead of the game.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.800]   - I could still buy back,
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.000]   I could still buy back in on the house money, but I won't.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.640]   - It's making you crazy, I'm sure.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.480]   (laughs)
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.320]   I'm sure.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.240]   - You know this hole,
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.480]   this hole not being able to own stock
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.720]   'cause your journalist thing does make me itch.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.080]   - Yeah, I bet it does.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.720]   But I kind of like it, you know?
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.480]   - Yeah, because now all the guys that you see.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.880]   - Well, you're the fanboy, you're just one of your stuff.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.720]   - Exactly.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.920]   - And I have this great line I give them now.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.080]   I have an owned Apple stock for more than six months.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.640]   I just emptied your clip, what do you got next?
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.240]   (laughs)
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.920]   - Well, that's good news, that's very good news.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.240]   - Yeah, that's kind of interesting to see that now
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.720]   there's still quite a bit of hubbub about Steve's health.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.920]   - Yeah, that hasn't died away, has it?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.560]   - I've seen posts every single day,
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.280]   mostly amongst the people that I watch a lot of blogs
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.320]   that deal with the financial side of Apple.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.920]   And there's just, it's approaching his dairy in a few places.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.640]   - You know, we talked about a little bit on Twitter as well,
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.000]   and it is the story that just won't die.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.800]   But I think we all, by the way, we said last week
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.080]   that if, because Apple's a publicly held company,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.240]   if there's something wrong with Steve,
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.720]   they would have to disclose it.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.240]   I asked Andrew Horowitz that of the discipline investor.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.520]   He said, "No, in fact, that's not the case.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   They are not obligated to, because while we may think
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.920]   that the company lives and breathes and dies by Steve Jobs,
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.360]   that isn't necessarily the case.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.520]   And so they're not, just because their CEO might be ill,
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.320]   they're not required to tell anybody.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.440]   - But wouldn't it expose them if, as they did,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.000]   they actually explicitly said, "No, Steve isn't really sick.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.760]   He just has a stomach flu or something?"
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.760]   - Yeah, see, that's the idea.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.120]   - Well, you can always be sued.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.280]   You can always be sued.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.880]   - Silence is always defensible, an actual out out of lie,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.720]   though, would that be a big deal?
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.200]   - Yeah, I think we actually said that.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.720]   I think we actually said that last week,
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.160]   or when we talked about this last Leo,
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.600]   was that it's not that they have to disclose it,
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.880]   but it's if they say he's cool when he's not,
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.000]   that that could create, certainly will create,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.160]   I can guarantee you're right.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.280]   I mean, it will create some investor lawsuits,
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.320]   if that were the case.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.520]   - We'd have to really parse.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.640]   - Why not so many?
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.640]   - We'd have to really parse what they said.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.480]   Did they say he's okay or just that,
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.840]   oh yeah, he's got a little stomach flu,
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.280]   he's on the box. - He's got a box.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.960]   - Yeah, they said the bug,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.360]   they weren't as easy as the bug.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.360]   - But they didn't say he doesn't have anything else.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.120]   - No, no, I think, you know, it's like you said,
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.000]   anybody can, I mean, Apple sued,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.320]   I think hundreds of times a day, so I mean, it's, yeah.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.360]   - They have a guy whose job it is to accept process.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.720]   - Yeah, come on, yeah, give it to me.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.720]   Yeah, next, nice to see you, Henry.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.560]   - They probably have a special door.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.920]   They have a special door out there,
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.000]   a one infinity, they just, you know,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.800]   one infinity loop, it's just that it's the service
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.280]   processor entrance.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.120]   - Just go on in there.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.640]   - They have their own cafeteria over there, too.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.480]   (laughing)
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.280]   - We'll just sit here and wait.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.400]   There'll be another one in a minute.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.560]   - It's not going to do without jobs, too.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.360]   I just did an article on, you know,
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.680]   the whole jobs health thing,
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.600]   particularly with the street was talking about it,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.200]   Jim Kramer. - Right.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.680]   - And I was kind of looking at, I mean,
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.040]   we all remember, you know, the Apple of the early 80s
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.720]   that as soon as jobs left, you know,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.440]   kind of sucked a lot of talent out of Apple
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.760]   to work it next.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.800]   And then there was a series of CEOs that were bad
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.760]   that made decisions that were not in the interest
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.600]   of the company.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.040]   All those things are not exactly the same thing
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.000]   that's going to happen this time.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.040]   This is not a kind of a fledgling company
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.960]   in a tech market that's kind of figuring things out
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.240]   as it was in the mid 80s, as Apple fell,
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.680]   and you know, and then over the next decade.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.320]   - But who would leave Apple if Steve were gone?
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.960]   I mean, who's next in line?
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.040]   - Tim Cook.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.560]   It depends on what you mean by lead.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.680]   I think as a CEO, very likely Tim Cook.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.520]   - Who is that?
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.520]   - He's not charismatic.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.520]   He's the CEO.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.360]   You see him very seriously looking.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.280]   He's usually sitting next to see your jobs,
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.360]   you know, in various times when they make public appearances.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.600]   - He's the guy who's running the joint.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.920]   - Yeah, he's from HP or Compaq, I believe.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.760]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.040]   - They hired him in 1987.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.240]   That's one of the first things jobs did
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.520]   is brought him into managed operations.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.200]   'Cause remember, Apple had this terrible problem
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.880]   with too many performers, not enough power books.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.200]   - Right.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   - He really does.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.480]   - He's done a good job, actually.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.240]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, he's, when you listen to Apple's,
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.200]   you know, the various, he's also in the stock,
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.520]   when they do an annual report, quarterly report,
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.680]   he's always talking about the numbers
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.360]   and talking about how much inventory they have
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.240]   and how they hit, you know, within the target
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.880]   of their inventory or had lean inventory or whatever.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.200]   He's likely the person that would kind of lead in that sense.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.000]   But, you know, Steve Jobs is a, you know, charisma
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.440]   and the kind of presenting that he does,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   that kind of portion, it will probably be taken over
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.720]   by Forestall, who's kind of...
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.320]   - Or maybe Phil.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.600]   - Yeah, I mean, Phil is a great kind of forward personality.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.440]   - Yeah, he's a front guy.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.760]   - He's funny and charming.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.880]   - He's just a senior vice president,
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.960]   so that'd be a big promotion, but, you know,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.120]   Schiller's been up there on stage with Jobs enough times
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.880]   that he knows the shtick.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.720]   And, you know, as for, as for Tim's being, you know,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.080]   you know, real gregarious out there personality,
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.520]   if you know any COOs like that, I'd be interested in meaning.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.920]   - Well, it's interesting because it sounds like,
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.360]   contrary to what people might be thinking,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.200]   that Steve has been given some thought
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.760]   to who might run Apple and has surrounded himself
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.840]   with people who could do the job.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.240]   - And that, that, in that many words.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.080]   I mean, that's what they...
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.360]   - He doesn't want to work there forever,
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.640]   whether or not he's sick has got nothing to do with it.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.280]   I mean, the guy's got enough money to do anything
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.520]   he wants when he wants, and he, you know,
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.800]   he may want to stop someday.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.040]   - When did he say that, Daniel?
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.480]   - The shareholder convention that was one of the,
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.320]   or shareholder meeting in the spring,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.680]   that was one of the concerns was about his health,
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.000]   and it typically, I think they brought it up before.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.720]   And he answered that, I think it was pretty well reported
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.520]   at the time too, but he answered that in,
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.920]   by saying, you know, we already have kind of a chain
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.040]   of command set up.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.800]   There's a lot of people that could take over
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.360]   various roles that he does.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.760]   So, you know, obviously they've given a lot of thought
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.480]   to that because, I mean, his, his,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.360]   the battle of cancer was in 2003,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.680]   and that was five years ago.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.800]   So, they've had a lot of time to think about
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.440]   what comes next.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.920]   - Right.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.080]   - I have a, I have a blog here that are actually
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.760]   blog posts by Apple Gazette that I remembered and pulled up.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.320]   They have a top five possible Steve Jobs successors,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.120]   Tony Stark, AKR Iron Man, Zeus,
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.880]   the WWE and McMahon guy,
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:23.280]   and the Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.640]   - And then-
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.080]   - Were you getting this from the chat room?
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.160]   - No, Apple Gazette.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.440]   I remembered seeing this the other day,
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.520]   so I pulled it up, there it is.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.360]   - Okay.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.040]   - It's from, it's from March, it's old, but,
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.960]   and then their number one choice would be a robo version
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.800]   of Steve.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.640]   - Yeah, so, I'm gonna-
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.480]   - Steve Clone.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.400]   - So you go ahead, Dad.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.600]   - How about a team, like a tag team presentation
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.160]   between Justin Long and
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.000]   - John Hodgman.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:47.840]   - Yeah.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.120]   - I don't think he would be the new co-CEOs
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.960]   of the company.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.080]   - They're like the 24 hour stick, yeah.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.640]   - The devil and the angel on Steve's shoulders going,
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.480]   - Right.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.320]   - I think you should make windows versions
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.600]   of the programs.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.080]   - No, you should, what are you crazy?
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.760]   So you're actually thinking that Jim Kramer
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.400]   is just kind of a
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.480]   flogging the market,
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.480]   trying to stir up some drama here.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.120]   - Well, I think, yeah, I think there's,
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.280]   he's putting so much attention upon,
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.440]   you know, Steve Jobs' health fears,
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.800]   because it's kind of an irrational thing.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.560]   It's not something that you can publicly deny
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.120]   or, you know, really clarify.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.000]   It's not like sales, you can't,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.840]   the street has been publishing a lot of information
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.920]   that's very kind of sketchy about,
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.880]   remember last year they said that Apple was,
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.080]   was trying to sell a million iPhones over the first two days,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.800]   and they failed to do that.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.400]   That was just, just, statistically impossible
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.440]   for Apple to do.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.760]   And, you know, it didn't line up with anything
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.520]   that was happening in reality.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.720]   And it was obviously to something that they put out there
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.560]   to make something really good look really bad.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.040]   And it was easy to deflate because you could,
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.480]   you could logically point out, you know,
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.120]   this is what, that would not have been possible.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.160]   Obviously Apple wasn't trying to do that.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.760]   But when it comes to Jobs' health,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.840]   what can anyone say to defend that because it's not known.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.680]   And, you know, Jobs is kind of a,
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.080]   - It's sort of out of the match.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.840]   - Out of the match approach is what I call it.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.120]   - Yeah.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:08.960]   - Well, thank you.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.240]   I'm glad, I'm glad Daniel that you're kind of,
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.920]   there's a, read Daniel's article, it's a great article.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.640]   And I think you do a good job of making your case.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.240]   - Well, yeah, I think he's wanting to install that
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.600]   as kind of a dial so that he can turn up the,
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.240]   what if Jobs, you know, can't run Apple anymore.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.840]   You should probably sell off all your stock.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.200]   And he's really given a lot of advice.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.080]   It's been pretty traumatic, you know,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.400]   dramatically bad over the last several years.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.640]   - He does have one point, he does have one point.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.880]   Regardless of how Apple would do without Steve Jobs,
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.800]   the stock price is gonna be, take a dive
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.080]   if Steve Jobs leaves or retires or falls in.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.640]   - And a major reason for that is because of all this hype
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.960]   saying this is the cause and effect, this has to happen.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.280]   When in reality, I don't, like one of the things
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.200]   that I point out in that article is there's a lot of things
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.960]   that are not gonna be impacted if Steve Jobs retired
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.280]   or, you know, if he became too sick to run the company
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.680]   in the immediate future, people are not gonna stop
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.400]   going to the Apple store, they're not gonna like
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.920]   start buying Vista, they're not gonna, you know,
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.080]   for a phone that is less capable than the iPhone.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.160]   - Zoot sales triple overnight.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.760]   - Right, you know, it's like, oh, no, there's no Steve Jobs,
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.120]   I'm gonna have to get, you know, a Motorola Q.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.520]   - Well, it's very, it's,
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.640]   - Well, the frame has been in trouble before too, you know.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.440]   - Oh, I know, and it's amazing that frankly,
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.120]   the guy's still working.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.000]   - Yeah.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.120]   - But he's funny, he's entertaining,
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.500]   and he certainly keeps the, keeps the volatile
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.880]   and happening and, you know, I think if, I mean,
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.760]   I'm not gonna scribe any monetary motives to him,
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.640]   you don't need to, it's a showbiz.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.560]   - I just say that he is to stock picking
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.960]   what wrestling is, what pro wrestling is.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.800]   - Yeah, showbiz.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.640]   - What pro wrestling is this for?
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.000]   - You know, he's hitting buttons and screaming
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.480]   and yelling and, you know, I mean, it's just showbiz.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.360]   I know a little bit about that.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.080]   I got some buttons here I can press.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   (laughing)
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.400]   - Let's get to our picks of the week
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.360]   'cause we're running out of time.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.320]   Yeah, I don't know if I didn't warn you about this, Daniel,
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.400]   but we like to pick a software product or something
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.680]   that we've been using a lot that we like to recommend
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.920]   to our friends, I'll give you a minute to compose yourself
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.120]   to think about it and I'll start with our good friend,
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.960]   Scott Borne, anything that's,
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.720]   Scott, actually, I'm gonna preface this
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.560]   and I apologize, I should have done this this week.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.600]   Alex Lindsey was circulated an email to us
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.560]   saying he'd been hanging out with some developers
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.880]   and he was kind of shocked to find out
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.760]   that they actually pay attention to this pick.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.120]   They hope that they will be picked.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.920]   It means a big deal.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.320]   It means a lot to them to get picked on this show.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.440]   And I think we've just been kind of training it as, you know,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.000]   hey, here's something cool that we like.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.200]   And I think Scott, you and Alex kind of said,
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.360]   maybe we should pay more attention to what we're picking here.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.920]   Yeah, it humbled me and humbled me.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.680]   I mean, I forget this.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.240]   I mean, you know, we do this show.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.640]   I mean, you know, people may not understand.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.480]   I mean, I come over to the studio and hang out.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.800]   We're off Mike, we're still talking about this stuff.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.880]   I mean, this is just what we do.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.560]   What we do, so, you know, for us,
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.280]   it's like we're a bunch of pals getting together
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.720]   to talk about stuff we're interested in.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.560]   And we forgot, oh, yeah,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.280]   there's hundreds of thousands of people listening,
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.000]   but it did humble me to think about it.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.840]   And I decided, you know, to be more careful about it.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.520]   And this week, you know, I was going to pick a cool camera strap.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.680]   And then I thought about the developer.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.600]   So I picked a site that's in beta.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.720]   And I think it's, it might still, it might be closed.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.800]   I'm going to give a code that might work here on the show,
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.720]   which might certainly close the beta.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.600]   Well, I'm really glad you put a lot of thought in this.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.400]   (laughing)
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.160]   It's bow trade is my pick of the week.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.200]   Bow trade, a PHO or FAUX?
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.200]   - H-O-T-R-A-D-E in Wheel of Fortune Missing Vow, Vane.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.800]   It's not photo trade, it's faux trade.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.960]   And this is a new site that, a new photography site,
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.040]   of course, that's got my interest immediately.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.720]   And I've posted some images there
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.120]   and have started a gallery there.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.080]   They're trying to kind of do a combination of flicker
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   and eye stock with some more stuff thrown in.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.560]   But those are the two most recognizable flares to it.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.040]   The difference being if you look at eye stock,
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.640]   eye stock's pretty much done from the photo buyer's perspective.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.080]   Everything that happens at eye stock
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.240]   is kind of done to benefit the buyer.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.160]   And faux trade's doing it to benefit the photographer.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.120]   So there's more money to photographers.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.520]   There are tools that are designed
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.760]   from a photographer's point of view,
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.320]   much better protection, for instance.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.840]   They have some algorithms built to make it harder
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.480]   for people to steal your photos.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.480]   It's really kind of, well, that,
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.120]   now it is in a beta product.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.440]   So, and I actually talked with them last week.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.480]   And they're like, by the way, we're really a beta.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.800]   And so we're gonna give you some invite codes,
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.000]   but we really want people to come help us make it better,
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.400]   not just slams 'cause it isn't perfect on day one.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.240]   - Cool.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.600]   - So should I give out that invite code?
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.120]   - Yeah, please do.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.440]   - Shash, put this down.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.680]   Put this in the show now.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.360]   - It's Twit, not to be confused with Twit
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.120]   because of Alex and I doing this week in photography show.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.280]   - Right, right.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.880]   - So it may still work.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.600]   It may not, I make no promises,
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.720]   but if you wanna try it as a photographer,
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.080]   you can use the code Twit
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.800]   and see if you can get in on the closed beta.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.400]   If not, just go browse it.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.160]   There's a lot of photographs up there.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.440]   And it's a very interesting model.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.800]   Unlike anything I've seen so far,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.000]   it's different from Zoomer,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.480]   it's different from, you know,
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.400]   P-base, it's different from Flickr,
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.440]   it's different from my stock,
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.040]   it kind of incorporates versions of all those things.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:34.880]   And it's free.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.760]   - It's kind of funny that you should pick that
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.120]   because my pick is a photo pick too.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.040]   - Is that funny? - Oh, what do you know?
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.680]   - Yeah, and similar in some ways.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.760]   You know that yesterday,
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.320]   the founders of Flickr joined the mass exodus from Yahoo.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.160]   - Yep. - A Caterina fake
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.360]   in Stuart Butterfield who created Flickr,
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.680]   sold it to Yahoo.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.280]   Now, I think Yahoo has been a good steward for Flickr
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.880]   and I'm not saying that Flickr is gonna suddenly go bad
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.240]   because Caterina and Stuart left.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.960]   But it did prompt a lot of articles about,
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.400]   well, if you didn't wanna use Flickr,
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.160]   Flickr did start going downhill
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.080]   or if Yahoo got sold to Microsoft,
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   what would you use instead?
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.800]   And I've been using a kind of a Flickr alternative,
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.400]   there are a number of other choices,
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.760]   there's Zoomer and Photo Buck and so forth.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.680]   But I've been using one that I just think is great
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.840]   from the Macaskills, it's called Smugmug.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.960]   And I'm sure you've seen Smugmug.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.880]   - Oh yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.760]   It's not free, this is the negative.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.240]   If you're a Flickr pro user,
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.440]   and I think anybody who's serious about Flickr,
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.280]   it's comparable in price to Flickr pro,
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.280]   there are several layers or stages or tiers of pricing,
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.400]   but it's 30, 40, 50, and 60 dollars.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.480]   I bought the top of the line
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.120]   because with it you can store high quality video on there
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.520]   and I don't mean flash video,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.440]   I mean high quality, quick time videos on there.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.080]   It is really nice to, if you pay for the slightly higher tier
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.040]   because you can integrate it into your site.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.440]   So Smugmug just like Flickr allows you to upload your photos,
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.160]   display them, tag them, pretty much all of the same,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.360]   create albums, same kinds of features,
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.840]   but it integrates right into my site so nicely
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.960]   with a little bit of CSS.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.880]   I have the same menu structure and so forth.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.440]   So if you go to leoloport.smugmug.com,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.360]   which is my Smugmug address,
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.400]   you'll see it actually looks like it's my website.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.160]   In fact, if you click any of the menus on there,
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.400]   it is exactly the same as my website.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.360]   It has the same background, it's the same everything.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.040]   It's integrated into my website.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.400]   So I really like it for that reason.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.440]   Instead of using something like copper mine
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.280]   to create a PHP based photo gallery on my website,
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.160]   I just use Smugmug.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.160]   Smugmug has spent all of their energy and time
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.960]   on making photo viewing easier.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.560]   So they have all sorts of sizes you can look at.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.520]   They have really great Ajax-y controls for it.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.400]   You can do a thumbs up, thumbs down in the photo rank.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.720]   The photo info is all there, all the XF information
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.440]   and even more and I think a much nicer, frankly, display
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.280]   than Flickr.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.240]   I think it's a little bit easier to use.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.440]   You could save the photos right from the site.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   And if you're a pro, you can sell photos there.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.480]   They do prints, they will do all the e-commerce back end.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.040]   So it's designed to, you know,
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.640]   a lot of pro photographers are starting to use Smugmug
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.920]   as kind of their back end for their e-commerce
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.320]   and their photo albums.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.840]   I'm really happy with Smugmug.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.800]   And so if you are, if you do feel like, well,
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.280]   with Katarina and Stuart leaving Yahoo with Yahoo's,
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.000]   leaving Flickr with Flickr being,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.160]   Yahoo being kind of struggling along,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.640]   this is something you might want to take a look at
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.840]   as an alternative.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.280]   There is a free trial version,
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.240]   but ultimately you have to pay for the pro version.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.320]   I kind of like that.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.760]   I feel like they've got a business model, you know?
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.560]   And you don't have to worry about a lot of ads on there.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.600]   What is missing is that Flickr community.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.680]   And there's nothing that can replace it.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   So you'll notice on my website under the photos menu,
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.400]   I do have both Smugmug and Flickr
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400]   and I continue to post to Flickr.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.400]   Smugmug also has a lot of nice interfaces over to,
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.200]   you know, other people's sites in ways
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.000]   to get lots of different ways to upload and so forth.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.400]   Some commenting, I don't think the commenting
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.040]   is quite as good as the Flickr commenting.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.280]   It's more album specific than it is photo specific.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.240]   So again, it doesn't support that community
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.880]   in the same way that Flickr does.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.520]   But if you just want a great photo album for your website
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.680]   or a way to store your photos
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.600]   and share them with family and friends,
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.160]   or even sell them at primsmugmug smugeemug.com.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.400]   I don't have a coupon code for you,
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.640]   but they do have a 30 day, I think, free tour.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.080]   - They're not in close beta.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.280]   - No, they are not there.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.360]   They've been around for a while.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.200]   And I just like these guys and they have a good
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.880]   solid response. - My coupon code isn't,
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.200]   my coupon code isn't a code to save your money
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.600]   or any of it, just get you into it.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.440]   - Get you in the door.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.280]   - Yeah.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.040]   So take a look at Smugmug and Ian Ocko.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.560]   We got a bunch of photographers here.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.200]   We're all photographers, isn't that funny?
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.040]   - That's right.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   We don't like to engage.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.360]   We simply like to document.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.400]   - That's probably why.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.560]   - That's probably why, yeah.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.880]   - A listener was sent me a link to something really, really cool.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   I'm not, like I said, I'm broadcasting from the mom,
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.600]   resorting casino in suburban Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.240]   Normally I'm out on the front porch
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.680]   where there's lots and lots of birds,
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.800]   like giving us their opinions of the new iPhone
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.280]   from the brushes and the trees.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.000]   And someone sent me a link to a library of bird sounds
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.960]   assembled by Cornell University,
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.440]   it's the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.880]   And boy, did I really, really enjoy this site.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.360]   It has, it's a group by regions of the United States.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.160]   It was such a great thing to play with
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:45.040]   because I've lived like in like the same two, three counties
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.120]   for most of my life.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.520]   I've been hearing most of the same bird songs
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.360]   and it's only recently only like 10 minutes
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.840]   after finding this being given this URL
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.120]   that I now know that it's the Black Cap Chickadee
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.720]   that makes the Phoebe B song,
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.520]   which is the Blue Jay, that does that,
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.680]   (imitates phoebe sound)
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.280]   sound, I've gotten them all wrong all my life.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.720]   Of course, I have not been terribly interested
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.600]   in the bird sounds, just, okay.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.280]   I believe that's some sort of bird, I believe.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.320]   - This is the Phoebe B sound, I believe,
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.160]   that you were referring to the Black Cap Chickadee.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.640]   - Yes, yes.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   - All my life.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.960]   - That is piercing.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.160]   - That is, well, you'll find them.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.080]   If you're interested in Chickadee for dinner tonight,
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.680]   you'll be able to track those down and shoot them.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.880]   They're very, very small.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.560]   Although it is cool in that, I believe,
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560]   according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.720]   it is the only Eastern United States bird species
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:40.880]   whose bird call is named after a Don Martin sound effect.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.720]   So.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.760]   - That is the sound of cockroaches
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.240]   underneath a board being stepped on.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.080]   - Phoebe B.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.160]   - Oh, an Abba song too.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.000]   - Phoebe B.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:50.840]   - Oh, don't.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.840]   - Phoebe B.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.560]   - Phoebe B.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.400]   I think that's just their English for something else.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.800]   They were Swedish.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.360]   - Phoebe B.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.400]   - Now, the sad news is that they also have,
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:08.400]   the URL is kind of long, it's like www.birds.cornel.edu/mccollylibrary/freesoundstup.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.600]   You'll have the link up on the Twitch site.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.960]   The sad thing is that they have,
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.880]   it's part of an even larger library
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.080]   at animalbehaviorarchive.org, all one word.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.000]   And you're really, you look at the front page
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.240]   and you're like, oh my God, best of the collections.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.920]   Organized under courtship, stalking, territory defense,
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.960]   communication, marine out animals.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.120]   There is a direct link to the popular harp seal pup sound,
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.440]   which would probably fit in very well
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.840]   with our pick of the, our audible pick of the week.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.120]   And so you're really, you know, cancel, cancel the dental appointment
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.320]   and then be spending the rest of the afternoon
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.880]   listening to these animal recordings and videos.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.240]   And then you realize that it's all in real player format.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.120]   And if I had two hours left to live,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.400]   it might be worth the trouble for the rest of my life
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.480]   to have real player on my computer.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.560]   They also have something called the Raven viewer.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.440]   So you click on that and it wants to install some other sort of plug-in.
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.080]   So you're more like, you know what,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:06.320]   I'm really not as interested in the false killer whale sounds as I once was.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.880]   So too bad there, but the free bird sounds are all in dot wave format.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.560]   So you can just click on them and play.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.440]   - That's great.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.320]   I do want to say about that site as an ornithologist,
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.960]   there's a lot of information there, not just sounds,
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.440]   but pictures and incredible information.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.880]   If you're into birds, that is, that's the place.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.720]   - Oh yeah, I forgot.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.640]   You're a big birder, aren't you, Scott?
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.600]   - I am. - Yeah.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.800]   - I have a lifeless Steven.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.280]   - Well, we, yeah, we, and we, and your lifeless is photos.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.360]   - My lifeless, yeah.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   - For a bird to make it on my lifeless, I have to have a full-frame photo.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.760]   - Yeah, and some beautiful pictures.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.920]   We did a little twit live thing with Scott and his bird pictures.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.760]   It just blew me away, blew me away.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.200]   Where are those online?
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.040]   - They're avianstock.com, A-V-I-A-N-S-T-O-C-K.com.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:53.680]   But I like, like Andy, I could spend many hours on this site.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.840]   - Yeah, now you have the scottborn.com site,
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.040]   so maybe we'll get some bird pictures there too.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.760]   - Very cool.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.800]   (whistling)
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.640]   - Fee bebe.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.520]   (chuckling)
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.600]   - Hey, I do, I do actually, it turns out I do have a smug mug coupon code.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.960]   Anybody who's on smug mug has a smug mug coupon code.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.800]   I didn't realize that, but the thing is, it's so long,
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.320]   it's kind of a lengthy thing.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.520]   You could just use my email, leo@leoville.com, and that would work.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.760]   And then you get, I think you have five bucks off, something like that.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.360]   - Yeah, the people from smug mug were listening to this show,
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.720]   and somebody yelled quickly, "Oh my God, did I go to Leo now?"
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.560]   (laughing)
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.120]   - Get my code!
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.520]   Get my code right now!
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.960]   Somebody said if you use a coupon code Flicker,
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.000]   you get 50% off.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.280]   So obviously, smug mug is, that's probably a better coupon code than mine.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.480]   Smug mug is attempting to capitalize on this Flicker flight.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.800]   Daniel, we gave you enough time to come up with a pick,
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.240]   something you'd like to tell people about that you think is really cool.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.280]   - Well, I think it's kind of a, earlier this week,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.160]   I kind of blew down the Sproutcar website.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.000]   (laughing)
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   They're hosted on Dreamhost.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:02.840]   - Yeah.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   - And I totally took it offline for the day.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.440]   So I thought now that they're back up, I could use that as my pick.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   - Great idea.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.440]   - The secret install code is pseudo-gymn install Sproutcar.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.120]   (laughing)
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.760]   Type that into your CLI and--
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.600]   - Secret password.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.280]   - Magicly appears on your computer.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.800]   - So it's not sproutcore.org, it's sproutcore.com.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.640]   - Yes.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.160]   - And there's demos, as you mentioned, there's that photo,
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.840]   iPhoto demo is very cool that Chris Breen was talking about,
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.720]   that you could download stuff.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.840]   But if you're on a Mac, as I know you all are,
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.280]   you've already got Ruby, so you just use Gem to install it,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.120]   and that's very cool.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.960]   And you can start writing Sproutcore code right now.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.720]   - Is there--
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.440]   - And for kind of more information about the company behind it
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.640]   and the developers behind it, it's sproutit.com.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.080]   They have another blog that kind of mentioned
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.960]   some of the interesting things about Sproutcore
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.320]   and some people that are using it,
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:06.000]   and how it works and how it interfaces with different browsers
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.840]   that kind of abstract the differences
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.320]   and say how IE and how Firefox and Safari present,
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.360]   JavaScript, the data models that they use internally,
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.360]   and how sproutcore just kind of acts as a layer above that,
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.560]   so developers can build on top of it
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.160]   in a way that doesn't break in different browsers.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.800]   And so it kind of explains a lot of interesting background
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.360]   on what's going on and what they're--
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.840]   - If you're continually updating about what's happening
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.680]   in the future too.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.880]   - Yeah.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.040]   Well, I think this is a first
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.120]   'cause everybody recommended a website.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.360]   I don't think that's ever happened before on this show.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:48.920]   - Well, we were appropriately chased because of--
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.360]   - Well, yeah, the developers are going,
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   "Wait a minute, didn't you wanna pick an app?"
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.600]   (laughing)
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.440]   - No!
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.360]   - The thing is though, the developers developed the website.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.000]   - That's right, hey, they're still a developer.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.160]   And I do wanna mention Roughly Drafted.com,
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.360]   the Roughly Drafted magazine,
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.400]   which is increasingly on my must read list,
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.120]   some great articles Daniel's writing on,
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.080]   is it just you, Daniel, you'd have some help on that?
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.720]   - I have people send in information that lets me in
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.160]   on what's happening in different areas.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.000]   Sometimes I've had people kind of co-write articles with me
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.840]   or do some fact checking and research
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.680]   that they've forwarded in.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.720]   - Well, you put a lot of effort into it,
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.560]   especially like all the links at the break,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.600]   which really make it easy to kind of do more
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.120]   and yet they don't interrupt the flow of it.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.840]   I think it's really a nice idea, very nicely done.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.400]   - Yeah, I try to prevent saying the same things
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.400]   over and over too many times,
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.720]   so I kind of referenced the article
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.280]   that I've already broached the subject in.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.000]   - Right, very good, roughly drafted.com.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.160]   Now, I'm sorry that we lost Chris Breen,
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.600]   he seemed to have fallen off the internet,
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.760]   so we can't get a pick from Mr. Breen.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.320]   Skype is being unruly.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.480]   We might try Uvoo, I was gonna make that
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.200]   a kind of a subsidiary pick
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.280]   because it is Mac, Windows, compatible.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.760]   The Mac version is in beta
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.600]   and not quite as capable as the Windows version.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.960]   And much to my annoyance, the Mac version,
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.760]   you can't buy the full feature set that you can,
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.560]   even though it's, even though the full feature set
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.640]   is available for the first 30 days,
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.760]   they for some reason don't sell it.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.240]   Well, while they do sell on Windows,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.360]   which I guess tells me it's just not finished yet,
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.640]   but we're gonna take a look at you starting to use Uvoo
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.480]   for shows like this,
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.520]   where we have multiple people,
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.440]   we wanna see everybody,
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.400]   because like IChat, you can have multiple video screens,
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.520]   up to six video screens, unlike IChat.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.160]   - And how do you spell that, you?
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.000]   - O-O-V-O-O.com.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.840]   And I'd like you guys to--
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.000]   - But I'm gonna go real, to balance it.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.560]   - It's a really good with Drobo.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.720]   - Yeah, Drobo and Uvoo.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.560]   - Drobo session.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.680]   - Ovoo Drobo.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.280]   O-O-V-O-O.com.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.120]   I'd like you to try it,
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.240]   and maybe we can do it as a test case and just see how it works.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.160]   The problem I've had with IChat is you don't,
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.200]   you have to have so much bandwidth.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.320]   It's really the multiple video thing,
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.760]   is really I think designed for a LAN,
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.960]   not designed for over the internet,
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.080]   'cause it requires such a huge amount of bandwidth.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:08.960]   Looks good, but I just don't have enough bandwidth to do it yet.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.600]   - Hey, thank you everybody for being here, Chris Breen.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.480]   I'm sorry, we lost you.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.840]   Chris Breen is the Mac Daddy.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.600]   You find him at Macworld Magazine.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.280]   He does the Mac 911 column,
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.600]   and of course, is it regular on the iLifeZone
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.320]   and many other great podcasts?
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.080]   This week at Photography's where you'll find
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.360]   Scott Borne among other places,
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.920]   but his new site, scottbourn.com
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.560]   is really a locus for them all.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.000]   That's his tumble log.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.760]   - It's very cool.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.120]   I like tumble log.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.520]   - Tumbler's great, isn't it?
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.560]   If you wanna add comments to that, you may not.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.280]   I mean, that's one of the things about tumbler that's cool.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.560]   - I do, how do I do that?
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.000]   - Yeah, discus, or discus, d-i-s-q-u-s.com.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.040]   - Discus. - Discus.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.960]   It's a blog, it's a blog commenting system
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   that I started using on leoville.com.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   At first, with some trepidation thinking,
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.400]   wait a minute, I wanna own these comments,
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.040]   but I really realized quickly that
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.000]   you don't own comments.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.520]   Comments are a very valuable part of the blog ecosystem,
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.960]   and a commenter is really as much a blogger by couple,
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.440]   but at least you wanna encourage intelligent comments
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.200]   in your blogs and discuss this very cool.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.520]   It has threading, it has karma, so you can vote up and down.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.760]   You can even bury people if they make a lot of stupid comments.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.680]   The other readers of your blog can
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.880]   be a great anti-spam filtering,
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.240]   and it works with tumbler.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.600]   A lot of people on tumbler are using it.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.560]   So d-i-s-q-u-s.com.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.440]   And twip, and scottborn.com.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.320]   And of course, Andy Inaco has the celestial waste
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.400]   of bandwidth, c-w-o-b.com,
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.960]   and you can see 'em in the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.800]   and also on the Apple phone show and many other places.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.960]   - Bill's. - Yes, on the ukulele.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.240]   As well.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.880]   Did you ever have a ukulele band?
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.960]   No, because I can never get one of those fake handlebar
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.040]   mustaches going.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.400]   (laughing)

[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.160]   Another Mac break is broke.
