[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120]   I took out my iPhone to snap how icy it was and ended up falling while I was snapping yikes

[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760]   Oh, I think I taught my son to break fall too. Well, he sent me a video yesterday of him
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.360]   Jumping off a roof. I don't know if I should oh
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.640]   Don't that's Andy and I co who has the sense the wisdom of age
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   Compared to my son who has the wisdom
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.320]   Jump off
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.760]   You could just tell I don't know
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.480]   Yeah, he's in college. That's apparently the stupid stuff they do in college
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Okay, that's the important thing
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   You see what the people the people you worry about are people our age who are like say
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   Oh wow that that boosted electric skateboard looks awesome. Yeah, that's true
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.720]   I used to hey, I used to skateboard when I was 17 20 years ago and then
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.640]   Yes, but you also had you also had a 17 year old's body that yeah
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.600]   Really is built for the stupid things you do when you're a teenager. Oh, yeah
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.560]   And he's with the Chicago Sun times. It's great to see you
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.000]   Both today. This is the slow time for Mac fans not much to talk about right now
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.640]   Right I can see you I can see you from behind your computer this time. Yeah, I don't have that horrible windows thing in front of me
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.960]   Or that luscious luscious giant touch screen
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.640]   That's what I really like I do love it
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   But I have to say when I do Mac break weekly
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.520]   It's a little bit of a disadvantage not to have a Macintosh
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   So if I wanted to show you in this case my app cap
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   I need to show you something on the Mac so
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.840]   App cap is what we call on iOS today on the on the more mature show our pick of the week
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.920]   Can you see?
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.120]   Huh?
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.360]   Can use VNC for oh, I guess I I guess I could wow
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.560]   Now you're getting my fancy remote to
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.300]   Remote desktop to a Mac somewhere out there isn't iPad Pro to remote desktop to a Mac then you have a touchscreen Mac
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.160]   What
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.920]   US appeals court revives anti trust lawsuit against Apple. Hey, I hate doing courts
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.600]   Can you believe this little apps are two apps are too?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.080]   Expensive, I mean if we just had some competition apps would be close to free or nothing now
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.920]   I mean I can't believe that developers have been completely price gouging people for so long
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.280]   Well, I'm not sure it has to do with that. I mean Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.720]   Yes, this is a suit that was filed in 2012
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.760]   You can have a class action lawsuit against Apple
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.280]   Because iPhones can only run apps purchased from Apple's app store
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.960]   The the group says that's anti competitive. I think it's classic. Well, I think that is fairly classic
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.680]   Monopolistic practice it's like saying you know, you can only if you if you're if you work in a coal mine
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.880]   You can only buy your goods from the company store, you know, I mean
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.160]   I was being facetious the illegal difference here is that
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.840]   Previous judgment said you can sue Apple that Apple was merely an intermediary for the developers
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   Yeah, yeah, you would have to go to the developers and this overturned that and said no in fact you can sue Apple
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.360]   Yeah for this is a little lower the issues right or wrong. They're just saying you can sue
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.520]   Yeah, lower court said that the the customers didn't have standing to sue. Yeah, because you're purchasing directly from the developers
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.840]   but I
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.880]   Think the I think the Ninth Circuit's correct because it's Apple that enforces this
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   You can only buy it from the app store rule not the developers in fact many developers would love to have a way not to go
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.120]   Through the app store. I would imagine
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.160]   But certainly I mean it'd be nice to have a sort of a
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.000]   Legal jailbreak like you have on certain other phones
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.920]   It's gonna be interesting to see if this is
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.160]   There there are a lot of these decisions that really define the fundamentals of the future of apps and technology and
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.040]   It would be interesting this went forward and the court basically said that if I've purchased a phone
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.120]   I have the right to put anything I want on it, which doesn't require Apple to allow everything
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.640]   But it but it would require a maker to say well
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.000]   There should be a switch buried somewhere in the menus. It says that okay
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.800]   If you flip the switch, we're not good. We're gonna let you sideload apps from anywhere
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.720]   And we're not going to give you free
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   We're not gonna give you system updates until you put that switch back in the position
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.920]   We want you to put it in we're not gonna necessarily support you if at the Apple Store if something breaks in a really really bad way
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.360]   But still we know that you own this phone and if you want to run
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.040]   Like Atari Linux on it. We will allow you to you have the right to put Atari Linux on this phone
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.880]   So it's a it's a basic thing that's I think really should be decided one way or the other apples argument against is probably
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   similar to the argument against the
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.080]   Librarian of Congress when he said that it wasn't illegal to jailbreak an iPhone
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.600]   Their argument is well that really impairs security and we're trying to protect our customers
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.400]   And so we make them go through our own store because we can vet every app in the store as you know
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.120]   Andy because you use an Android phone Android solves this by having a checkbox and kind of deep in the settings
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.240]   It's not amelia obvious the default is you could only buy from Google Play Store
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.600]   But you there is a checkbox the default behavior
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.120]   Which is kind of interesting is if you try to install an app from a third party
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.400]   You can download it obviously and APK is the file format and download it when you do that it says alright
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.320]   But this is from the third party do you want it disable our block and when they do so they disable it for one time only
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.480]   So it's that which I think this is a good way to handle it
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.720]   That's the that's for this install if you go in the settings you could turn it off permanently
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   But they then give you a big security warning saying you know you're you're on your own here
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.900]   Make sure you're downloading from reputable sources and stuff. That's not the Apple way, but but I
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.960]   I think they do gatekeeper on the Mac like that. I mean it's it's how they do it on the Mac, right?
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   Yeah, but on the on the Mac, but they don't do it on iOS, right?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   I mean, it's I respect the point of view that says that we are going to we we are going to give you the ability to
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.520]   Totally destroy your life if you feel as though that's a risk worth taking we are not your mom
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.840]   We are not your dad even if we were your mom or dad
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.740]   We would just simply try to tell you please don't get a tattoo
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.620]   Your first year of college, but you would be free to get that tattoo
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.240]   Apple is like gonna make sure that you were gonna laminate your entire body before we send you off to college
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.320]   Because we're gonna make it impossible for you to do something that you we think you might regret
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.280]   But you might think is the greatest thing ever the argument you made Renee
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.880]   Is the argument that the attorneys in this case pepper versus apple are making which
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.780]   Lower prices, but to me, I don't think that I agree with you. It's not
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:23.060]   How's that? Well, no, that's the thing is that this this lawsuit is not at all about the openness or the freedom to put applications
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.040]   Which is what it should be about this is about money they they and this is why it's targeted apple because apple has very big pockets
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.560]   And they're making the argument that because apple has the app store and you can't get apps for anywhere else Apple is artificially making
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.200]   Prices too high which worked gangbusters when they went after apple for the iBooks lawsuit, but here
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.920]   I think it'd be tough. I mean just ask any developer it'd be tough to say that the app store has artificially impressed in
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.120]   artificially inflated software prices in fact the app store is a huge contributor to
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.960]   Deflation the race to the bottom developers most developers would be really thrilled if apple word would
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.440]   Officially inflate. Yeah, so I think that point is very important
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.720]   Like the point about the free like what Google does with Android versus iOS
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.960]   But I don't think that's the motivation or the crux of this law
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.600]   Where's particular losses? Yeah, I don't want to impute this law firm
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.280]   But it sounds like they're really interesting collecting damages. They say the other alternative is
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.600]   For apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices. They've had to pay historically because apple was utilized
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.080]   You imagine but that's how they're making money prices people would owe apple money. It's a contingency
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.400]   Law fee lawsuit right so they want to get a big settlement
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.760]   They don't really want to open the store what they want is a big cash settlement
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.920]   So that they can take their percentage and walk away happy and usually when these in these cases, you know
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.520]   If we've probably all received postcards, I remember getting a postcard because pop chips
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.800]   Got cut sued and there was a class action settlement and I your 15 cent credit towards pop chips is is in the mail
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.040]   That's kind of how it works out that the users get nothing and the law firm gets most of it
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.320]   I don't I don't know if that's the arrangement and apples argument
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.120]   I mean you get ready to laugh
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.960]   But there are even always been that the web is their open app store like you can develop for iOS and a secure way with complete access to the system
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.200]   Or if you want we have this completely open developer environment back then called web 2.0 and alcohol
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.720]   HD and all five and you can do all sorts of fun things without having to worry about security requirements I
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.360]   Have mixed feelings about this because I
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:23.040]   Do you know I mean to me it's more about well, there's apps you can't put on the iPhone like let's say a simple Apple Wi-Fi?
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.160]   analytics program which you could put on an Android device and you could put on a Mac
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   But you can't put an iPhone because Apple seals off the Wi-Fi radio API
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.520]   anything low-level the audio low-level stuff like audio hijack does the i-stat menu stuff that Django does yeah
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.160]   That's you think
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.920]   go ahead you think about all the cool stuff that third-party software can do on the Mac that Apple never considered and
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.160]   You wonder what how much better could the iPad be how much better could the iPhone be if Apple allowed that kind of latitude
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:59.960]   To its own developers and I really I like the gatekeeper system on on Mac OS because like Renee said if you want to download
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.520]   An app use an app that Apple has not blessed it will let you do that if you want to protect yourself against inadvertently
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.440]   Downloading an app that may or may not be safe. You can also flip use that use the default setting it will not allow those things to run
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   But again ultimately it's up to you
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.360]   But I really can't think of I can think of so many apps that I'm running on the Mac
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.680]   from different winter resize managers to again audio stuff that basically lets me create a virtual
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.920]   Audio input device that can solve problems with a little piece of software that ordinarily would have taken me a
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.440]   $300 piece of hardware in order to fix
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:41.760]   These are the sort of things you really have to let your community do or else you're going to wind up with a very vanilla very boring thing
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   I was listening I've been researching
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.280]   the
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.240]   I don't I'm only speaking about Android as a point of comparison where if you really want to get insane about it
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.600]   You can change you can change the ROM of an excess phone. You can change everything about it
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   Like there's a features that are in the pixel
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.480]   The Google's house branded phone that aren't available to any other phone yet
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.720]   But you can download the source code run a special ROM that other people have compiled and essentially turn a two-year-old phone
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.000]   into a pixel phone with all the same features and
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.840]   Really, it's totally up to you and there's a good chance you're going to break your phone if you do that and it's not a simple linear
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.640]   Process, but if you're adventurous or if you've just got a two-year-old phone
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.960]   Then you don't have a hundred dollars for a new one, but you do like these features
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.200]   Okay, spend a weekend tearing your hair out and maybe by Monday you'll have something that works great
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:37.720]   This is I really do think that the overarching principle is that you should have ownership of the device that you paid money for and
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   Ownership is expressed not just by having a receipt and a bill of sale
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.960]   It means that if there's something I don't like about this if I'm willing to put in the what might be considerable amount of work
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.520]   And take a considerable amount of risk. I should be able to do that. That's what ownership means
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.640]   I mean, I'll ask you the other side
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:03.840]   Because one cannot deny that the iPhone gets better battery life because of this tight control of apps that Apple asserts is
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.160]   Not totally secure, but but I would say much more secure than other platforms because of it
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.760]   And as you say Renee, they've been able to pressure app developers to lower the price over time
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.000]   Well, it's it's like for me a super zig because I would love like I'm with you guys
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.160]   I'm like a power user
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.720]   I would love a Konami code that just unlocked developer mode and let me do things with it
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.120]   But I also recognize that I'm in the minority on this
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.680]   I would personally love Apple to do this
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.800]   But I think they would argue that their malware is like almost non-existent compared to some other more open platforms
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.280]   And also that almost every one of the truly significant apps that have come out over the last decade
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:45.960]   Whether it's Facebook or uber or snapchat or anything that we would hold up as a revolutionary software works great on an iPhone
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.320]   There's very the issues that people run into are things that are more fringe or more power users or specific niche user
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.440]   centric and there will be the sacrifice that 2% in order to have a better experience
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.520]   Yeah, I think that has more to do with when you're developing an iPhone app you're targeting three pieces of hardware and not a lot more
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.880]   I don't I really don't think it's a really malware is a
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   Much more serious problem on the Android platform than iOS certainly
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.960]   But when you talk about when you change the focus to how many Android users actually are affected by malware
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.900]   Who are running who who are comparable to an iPhone user meaning that they don't they're not running like a three or four-year-old
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.840]   Technology phone they're not running a three or four-year-old operating system
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.960]   They are buying apps directly from an app store where the content is controlled by Google
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   That's really not a big number
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.240]   So some I don't I don't think I don't think the user
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.520]   I don't think that users are giving up a whole lot by having this extra freedom and the things that they can do and I'm not
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.920]   I'm not talking about loading a bootloader or custom ROM
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.680]   I'm talking about saying what if the what if the home screen did something other than give me a static
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   Tile of icons what if it did this instead?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.880]   I don't think that users are I think users are getting a lot more than giving than they're giving up in that instance again its ownership
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.120]   Yeah, I just think it's when Apple balances it out that to them is a very very small part of their market
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.920]   now
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.560]   To me, I'm 100% of my market of as a consumer
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.440]   I'm not I really don't care what Apple thinks that Apple says that you're not important Andy what you want believe me
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   We spend way more time than you thinking about how you should be using your phone and just give us your money
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.640]   Yeah, I think it's absolutely true
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.720]   People who used to like develop like back in the days before the iPhone used to develop for Palm and they would have
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   19 different websites
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.880]   They had to go to to get their apps out of no good direction
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.640]   And then also like I look at just my family using using iPhones and they just could not use a previous generation of smartphones
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.600]   They do not know that they that they can't get apps from right
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.560]   They wouldn't even care because the app stores the easiest way for them to get those apps
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.040]   So again, I just don't think it hits the majority of customers
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.280]   Ignorance is bliss. We all we've already seen even with the real to freedom that you get that developers have on the Mac
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.680]   You have developers like rich seagull who said look I'm spending way too much time from my from our perspective at barebone software
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.880]   Dealing with BS that is helps Apple but doesn't help us
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.960]   We would like to spend more time improving our product instead
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.120]   We're spending all of our time making our app compatible with new operating systems
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.800]   And if that's a requirement for inclusion in the app store, we're out
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.720]   And so they were those it was it's a situation that's unique to barebones
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.440]   But they are able to make that decision as opposed to saying we're out
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.520]   We're no longer supporting the Mac at all because we have the ability to simply again flip a switch and
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:38.400]   And run and run an app that wasn't created wasn't wasn't sold by the app store
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   So I'm saying that I think on the iPhone
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Right, it's I know I you know as a user of both platforms and a regular user of both platforms. I
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.760]   I don't
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.720]   Really feel like it's a big deal that Apple should be forced to allow that that that's part of the choice of Apple
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.280]   I always when people people call me on the radio show all the time and say well
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.320]   How do I get an iPhone to do this?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:07.160]   And I say well you don't but that's you chose a platform for that reason and if you want to know more open platform
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.400]   There are other choices out there. They're like a shopping mall who controls their tenants
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   It's not you can't just come and open up us or in the big head. Yeah, don't get to choose and that's and that's the price you pay for using an iPhone
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.040]   Of course, you know, you can also make the argument a lot of people just buy an iPhone without really thinking about that and then
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.240]   Realize it well
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.680]   They might switch to an effort bothers and they might switch to Android and Apple loses that sale and you have to factor that into their overall
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.040]   decision. Yeah
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.200]   Yeah, I mean clearly it hasn't hurt Apple in fact the best thing that's a couple of Apple hasn't it really I mean the easiest way
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.600]   To change Apple's mind on this is to have an app land on Android
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:44.000]   They just absolutely could not be done on iOS and that to be such a popular app that it hurts them that it is not on their
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.520]   platform and they would change their mind. I can't think anything like that at this moment although there a lot of really useful apps that
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.880]   Well like Google Assistant and now on tap, you know when you're
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.820]   Using your Android device if it supports now on tap you can be on any page and then
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:07.240]   Hold the the voice button and it will look at the page and find contextual information related to that page
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.680]   That's something you could not do on Apple without Apple Apple have to do that
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:17.960]   And Apple doesn't do that and I think that that's it's there are things but an iPhone users never gonna know about
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.480]   Because they're busy. They're happy with uber
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:27.080]   Snapchat and with Pokemon go and most and we know this we know most people for instance don't install third-party apps
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.840]   HTC said most people don't use widgets and the ones that they do use are the ones that were there when they bought the phone
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.440]   I mean with all with great interest Megan Maroney using a Android phone for the first time
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.480]   She and Jason howl switched so Jason's using an iPhone for a month and Megan's using an Android pixel for a month
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.120]   And it's interesting to watch as she
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.960]   Kind of discovers these layer after layer of configuration options and it's it's a lot and
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:20:00.520]   Lateful it I like it you like we geeks like it. It's great show. Yeah, but I think normal people
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.280]   It's like well, that's too much. I don't it's just a
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.280]   Most people still think this is a phone with some internet capabilities some people love building gaming machines exactly the way they want
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.920]   Yeah, people just want to buy a box that turns on. Yeah, yeah
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.880]   This is but I don't think the two things are comparable
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.040]   I think that if you don't want to customize Android at all you don't have to it will operate just like I told you
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   I said you can make a grid on guns and just use it like a knife
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.060]   There's there's a there's a there comes a point like two months into your ownership of a new car when you're like
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.440]   Damn it. I really really wish there were a cup holder right there
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.760]   and
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.000]   Chrysler will tell you well look we've done so many surveys people don't want a cup holder on the left side of the driver's seat
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.720]   Say, okay, I don't care about all the people you talk to I want one there
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.040]   And but you can actually put a cup holder on the left side of the driver's seat
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.000]   If you if you actually want to as opposed to being told that we don't support that third-party stuff
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.960]   We're not gonna allow you to do that
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.360]   We're not gonna turn off warranty service
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.400]   You're gonna have to jailbreak your car to put a cup holder where you want it and again at the end of the day
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.360]   This is your car and a couple is such a simple thing to do
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.600]   so it's it goes back to something that I
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:12.840]   Consistently have to sort of evaluate my reactions to whenever I hear that the various articulations of the phrase well people don't use that feature
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.040]   Let's say that it's
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:22.600]   5% of people who use a certain given feature that that's being applied to the thing is it's never the same 5% for each feature
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:29.400]   It's a mobile 5% and by the time you you're having conversations about 50 features. You are eventually covering
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.080]   Maybe close to a hundred percent of the user base
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.940]   I would like to do something but camp and once you get into that situation you need to have a hard conversation with your
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:43.040]   with yourself and decide is it worth in conveniencing
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.840]   100% of our users 5% of the time to
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.440]   introduce this limitation that we think is important and
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:58.840]   I think oftentimes it's not that it's not a good trade. There's also the in the back of my mind a kind of a niggling
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.560]   Feeling that Apple does some of these things not for
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.000]   Security or reliability or consumers, but because for economic reasons and I'll give you an example
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.560]   This doesn't really relate to the app store, but locking down NFC on the iPhone
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.800]   on an Android phone every app has access to the NFC chip and so there's been a very there's all sorts of great uses of
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.880]   NFC on an Android phone including pairing with devices I can tap an Android phone to my camera and
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.600]   and set it up
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:36.440]   Automatically you can't do that with an iPhone because Apple says the only thing NFC can be used for is is Apple Pay and
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.360]   You know they make an argument
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.320]   I guess Renee you probably know the argument well that this has something to do with the security of Apple Pay, but oh
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:50.120]   It seems to me that controlling the NFC chip is an example of maybe doing it for economic reasons as well
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.280]   My understanding is that it was it was funnier than that
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.360]   It's like they've been thinking about doing NFC since Scott or stall was still running
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.200]   They were slow to go to NFC and well yeah, they were just like well
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.760]   We it's not really that you well
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.640]   There's stuff we can do with Bluetooth while we can use it and the only reason they put NFC in was to make Apple Pay work because Apple
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.480]   Pay just simply would not work with that NFC so right now the mentality is that we don't actually have NFC on the phone is just an under it's a
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.680]   It's an implementation like a what is it an implementation detail of having Apple Pay?
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.840]   Oh, it's not something that they're ready to so we don't do NFC and till we do and then we'll go all crazy about how great NFC
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.320]   Sure, but if they could have done over Bluetooth they would have right there would have been one less radio
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.040]   Well, and it would be interesting to see when Apple if Apple does in fact go to wireless charging in the next generation iPhone
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.280]   How they will trump it, you know, it's finally here
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:42.160]   No, so it is funny
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.560]   But if you go back to that Samsung wireless with they're saying we don't have a cord and you see that all the cords are plugged in to their little
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:53.680]   Dongle you still have to plug those dongles in but what Apple supposedly working on is is distance charging where you just walk in the room
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.480]   And it starts charging, but I still don't know what's on the other end of that there has to be some Apple device
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.240]   That's providing that charge and that to me is like the really interesting question
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.920]   Yeah, I know it's a tangent
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   But is it a new generation router? Is it a new generation Apple TV? Is it a new generation computer?
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   What is spewing that power into my room?
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:17.520]   Yeah, and I like there's such a thing as a tactile user interface the humans are very very strange organisms
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:25.080]   That if you tell us that don't worry if you walk into the if you walk into the your bedroom with this phone
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.920]   It doesn't matter where you put the phone. It's going to be charged by the time you wake up tomorrow
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:35.600]   I have a if I have a flight to catch at 8 a.m. Tomorrow with involving two airports
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:42.360]   I want to I want to go I won't be able to really fall asleep until I know that I have done something
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:50.500]   Memorable and tactile that will cause electrons to go into the device even if and I had a I'm sorry to that they
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.280]   That my Nexus 5x doesn't have wireless charging because when I had my Samsung I actually in my my Nexus 5
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.600]   I really enjoyed you just have this cheap little ten dollar pad
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.740]   Anywhere that you happen to leave your phone like there's there was one on my desk
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.440]   There is one on the on the sofa
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.800]   There is one on my nightstand and you just sort of drop it there anywhere
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.000]   And then when you see the light change from from green to blue or whatever, you know that okay
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.080]   That's all I needed to do and you didn't realize how inconvenient it is to
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:25.320]   Fish around for a charging plug and plug it into the bottom of something until you suddenly don't have to do that anymore
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.400]   And the phone winds up charge so there's actually a feature
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.080]   I think to saying you don't have to you don't it doesn't have to be this big console
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:39.000]   But there's going to be something with an X or a circle on it that as long as you can get it like like Canadian curling
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.800]   As long as you get it somewhere in that circle you will get points for having charged the phone when I had that problem
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.120]   Though like I don't know if you've had this but like with the inductive chargers
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.560]   I think was my palm pre I knocked it with my blanket one night
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.640]   And it went off enough that it didn't charge and the phone didn't work and twice this week
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.840]   I didn't perfectly put my Apple watch on the inductive charger and I woke up and it hadn't charged and
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.640]   When I'm really like and that it has no plug
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.880]   So I have to be really sure about that if I have to go to an airplane
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   But I still plug anything that I really depend on in now because I want to know that it's gonna work
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.920]   I think that's really more a failing of the design of wireless chargers frankly
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.560]   Yeah, well, yeah, there's this if you swap like that. I don't think that that's a well-designed charger
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.400]   I use a little I use a little
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.160]   Tosh a little Macintosh is what you need to you
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.360]   I had the problem with my first charger and then I bought then I bought one that was only a little bit more where such a brilliant
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.320]   Simple elegant solution. It was a pad that was like about
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.720]   Little larger than the size of the phone
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.120]   But it actually had like two three or like four separate charging pads on it
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.000]   So what so that if you got if you got it anywhere on the on the charging pad
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.880]   It would be close enough to something to charge up your phone
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.840]   Yeah, so sometimes you don't need a new standard. You just need to say what if we increase the cost by 38 cents
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.000]   And actually put multiple charging pads on this I use a little easel
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.320]   Charger and I just once the phone is in that easel it's gonna charge
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.800]   I you could knock it out of it
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   I guess but I mean once it's in there it's gonna charge and I just this is the tilt
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.320]   TYLT, but I just are I guess it's yeah, I just I feel like that's I
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.840]   Don't know it's just that's a design issue. That's not a fault with wireless charging
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.400]   Also, Renee being really tired when you stop sitting down on top of it issue and I also have to point out that
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.440]   Renee we're all adults go ahead and use the phrase energetic lovemaking. It's fine
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.760]   It's a point of pride in some cultures you turn the watch away. It doesn't have to see that
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.400]   Well the last thing I want to know is what time it is
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.080]   And I want to have to we actually took all the clocks out of the bedroom because that that you don't want to get distracted by
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   Oh, I'm late for work
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.720]   I'm a little TMI. I think so yeah
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:56.120]   Why did the numbers change that is by the way, okay as long as we're we're going there that is another issue
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.560]   Apple control apple decides what's
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.320]   Politically correct in the app store. What's adult and not adult in the app store?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   I mean, it's kind of a nanny about the content and they're really well mark of the app store
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:16.360]   Yeah, you really can't make an argument that that's for consumer. I don't know what that's for that Steve Jobs own bias carried on I guess I
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.460]   Know I'm again. That's a business decision. They believe that if they make the environment
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.800]   Yeah, fairly fairly safe that it'll encourage parents and children and everybody use it and if there were stuff in there
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.400]   That was not appropriate that they would have much more issues with trust
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.280]   But and with people feeling safe, but it's less the adult content to me and then the political content
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:43.160]   You know, they're just under signing what politics are okay, and what aren't I don't think it's it's hard absolutely
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.000]   They're right. I
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.040]   Don't deny they flip flop a lot on those because that is really hard to yeah, it's hard to me because
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:57.920]   We forget that apps are a form of communication after all that you can have an app that if you can have someone who is
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.280]   Creatively trying to spread the word or trying to solve a social issue by releasing an app that keeps you informed about headlines about
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.680]   Here's what's going on in this part of the country or here's what this regime is responsible for right now
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.600]   There are people who would like to create for instance
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:20.440]   A watch face that here is here is how many civilians have been killed by this regime as of eight o'clock this morning
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   I'm not depressing thing when you're trying to figure out if to make the train
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   But this is the sort of thing that gets people's minds focused on a problem
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.720]   And if you are saying that we will not allow political commentary of any kind
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.920]   I think that Apple absolutely has the right to do that just like any store has the right not to carry mine
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.160]   Comp if they feel like they don't want to have mine confident the store it is an itchy problem that
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.200]   Maybe there's no real solution to but it's something that everyone has to be aware of at least yeah
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.760]   This is the wireless charger that I I use oh, yeah
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.440]   It's nice to have that your bedside and you just put the phone
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   I'm actually more and more yeah, and I have you know
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.960]   I have the Apple little dock, but you've got it. You know you can kind of get the lightning right on there and
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:09.520]   The other great thing about those those wireless chargers is that while while I was using that phone I
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.680]   Never didn't know where my phone was in the morning. Yeah
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.640]   To be right there to be like oh wait I forgot I put it
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.620]   I put I connected it to this thing last night or a cup. Yeah, it's it's the view VU from
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.520]   It was such a river stone that I would just put it on the I forget what they call oh yeah
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.560]   I remember that but that was weird and I for some reason in the early days of Chi a lot of these chargers were
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.100]   Just almost designed to slip off of you know these devices. There was one that windows phone had that was a pillow
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.280]   Hello, remember
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   Nexus 4 would slip off of a giant table if you put it in the middle of the table on a flat side down
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   It was just enough time. It was crazy
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.040]   anyway, the funny thing is
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.440]   Google's eliminated wireless charging too. So maybe it's a bad idea. I don't know it was in if yeah, well there was
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:04.400]   Yeah, but I mean we're not talking. I mean the light bulbs inefficient too. I mean we're not talking a
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.120]   Huge amount of inefficiency
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.600]   Again, I'm so curious about if like Apple and I've heard apparently they are gonna be doing this wireless this
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.680]   Really wireless charging and I don't know what that I am so skeptical
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   I am so skeptical. I just find that the health issues alone
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.360]   Is it gonna cook you as you walk by do you are you gonna?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.160]   There's no to get to get power
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.040]   You know power is the inverse square to get power three feet away from something
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.720]   Requires so much power coming out of that thing
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.640]   Uh that I find it impossible to believe that that's not dangerous health hazard
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.120]   Yeah, all I can all I can say is that the last time I even curse in a cursory way
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:54.320]   Asked engineers about this they said that there are some ideas, but none of them are practical. Right. I mean there's an all to a sound and
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.360]   Yeah, I mean you can again if you want to win a bar bet or if you want to prove a technology works
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.920]   Right, you can make it happen. The best they could say is that they could commercially
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.800]   They're not saying apple. I'm sorry the technology
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:15.440]   Could create sort of a virtual charging station where so long as you put it on the table and it's sort of near
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.240]   This little pod that you've also put on the table. It will charge
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.000]   And even then they said that they'd be really really cons... they'd be
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.200]   They the one engineer talked to said that he feels as though most of his time would be spent
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   Making the FCC happy about this device
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.120]   Because but that doesn't mean that he was he was a
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.160]   Golden expert on wireless charging technology and this was like two or three years ago
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.600]   So there's always room for breakthroughs, but yeah, it's I will when when apple
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.280]   When apple releases true wireless be anywhere in the room charging
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.920]   I will learn something I did not know before about how is possibly charge a battery
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.200]   That's not a bad thing and you want to talk in efficiency
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.400]   I mean that's got to be massively inefficient. Why are we just gonna do pockets? I mean wouldn't that work
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.240]   Why is putting your pocket in sideways honey honey
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   I
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.760]   Is it a credible rumor? I mean or yeah, it really is huh? Yeah interesting
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.200]   Well, we'll find out in september. I mean what the rumor how that how much has been distorted over the what they're actually doing
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   It's hard to say but yeah
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.280]   All I know is when you climb suit to a tower the big radio tower in san francisco
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.160]   You have to wear a mesh wire a metal mesh bunny suit
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.600]   To go up there. I did it before that regulation and I had the RF burnt before it was cool
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.520]   I had little white spots on my hand. I asked the chief engineer what what are those? He said, oh, that's just our f burns nothing
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:43.200]   Okay, well you still have the hands leo so you know, uh, the cancer hasn't set in yet so
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:50.560]   And that was if you want to have children mr. Laport and I had children now admittedly they both came out a little whopper jud
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.440]   Maybe that was maybe that was could have been the sutra tower. Who knows
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.520]   Oh sure cookies cookies would levitate out of the cookie jar
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.280]   But that could be anything leo gets our f burn today that years ago then today is sun jumps off a building
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   They could you know, it really could be connected couldn't it
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.080]   Dad, I wouldn't have done that if you hadn't climbed suit to a tower back in 1985
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.920]   I don't want to I don't want to say anything negative about i'm not i'm just asking a question
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.840]   Did this happen before or after that viral video of that person?
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.160]   who who had a youtube channel about him jumping off of tall buildings and
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:33.280]   landing inside pool co-tell pools until the time he totally didn't and
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.040]   And that's the thing I dread, you know one successful thing and now it's gonna be we're gonna up the ante
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   I gotta really somehow watch this
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.160]   I try this you convince them that jumping off things isn't cool flying from the up from the ground up is cool
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.720]   Oh, yeah getting from the ground take off. Yeah, just keep practicing take off. No use gravity. That's a that's a chip
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   Yes, you got a fight gravity. Yes
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.560]   Superman jumps off. He doesn't jump off
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   I admit I did try in apple messages. I was very disappointed to find animated gifs of horrific injuries from falling
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.040]   But I couldn't find any
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.080]   I'm not kidding this morning. I was searching couldn't find any
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.680]   Thank you apple. You see this is why they got to open it up
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.080]   Our show today brought to you by a brand new sponsor want to welcome jam
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.360]   To mac break weekly. I think some of you already know jam if you are managing
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.960]   uh
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.320]   devices
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.440]   management managing mobile devices jamps mobile device management software empowers it to provide
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.960]   the experience the user friendly experience your employees want and expect and deserve
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.800]   If you've got a enterprise with a bunch of apple devices and god knows you probably do
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.640]   These days you can automate device management drive productivity with jam pro now
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   You may remember it under the name casper suite
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:59.760]   Now jamf. It's the it tool you need to quickly deploy devices manage daily updates
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:07.200]   accurately inventory device hardware and software and secure devices through patching and automated restrictions
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:14.240]   Jamf pro's self service feature allows users to do the same they can install apps update software and maintain the status of their device
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.400]   If you let them but but that's not you know, they let makes them feel good
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:26.000]   Without it assistance from its world class support to its professional services and training courses jamp has everything organizations need
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.800]   To ensure their apple implementation is a long lasting
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.600]   success
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.080]   Jamf now
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:43.120]   They've renamed the variety of tools. So i'll fill you in. This is bushel remember bushel jamp now is a cloud-based management solution
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.200]   That's simple accessible more affordable small businesses can afford it
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.400]   Which allows you to support your users without high t help
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.960]   It's everything a small business using an apple device or devices needs and nothing more no training
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.760]   No documentation required. It just does it jamf now can remotely configure device settings
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.000]   I wish we had that because when we moved to the new building we have all these people who
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   uh
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.280]   Were needed to have a Wi Wi-Fi calling turned on on their phones and I had to go from
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.480]   Person to person and turn on Wi-Fi calling. I would have loved this
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.280]   Oh, yeah, let's just turn it on distribute apps manage app licenses and force security measures like passcodes and lost mode
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   Oh, man
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:29.040]   Don't you hate it when you're your users say I lost my phone? Well, well, you have find my iPhone turned on right? No

[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.440]   J amf dot com slash mac break we thank jamf for their support of mac break weekly i didn't even think of that
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.440]   Thank you jamf. We're talking apple. We're talking mac
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.280]   We're talking
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.560]   All sorts of stuff with Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun times
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   Renee richie from i'more dot
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.120]   com
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   consumer reports backs down
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:54.480]   Now whoa, you know the funny thing is people i actually heard i saw tweets or whatever that said oh apple paid them off
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.360]   Come on i gave a sandwich give a quickie sam
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.560]   Come on
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:06.640]   Oh people are adorable. I love humanity. I i i hope we let you live another 800 years at the very least
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.400]   That's adorable. Well, i mean it would explain the 18.5 hour battery
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   This all because i want that macbook pro. Yeah, but that that's right
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.040]   So we we talked about this last week. Yeah, we said there was a red flag when consumer reports
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.760]   Said we are not going to recommend the macbook pro for battery life because in that recommendation
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.480]   They said but weirdly enough we got great battery life when we use chrome
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.800]   Which is with safari wasn't that weird and and even when we used safari sometimes it was really good sometimes really bad wasn't that weird
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:40.160]   But this is our recommendation anyway, and i think your your point uh, Renee was well taken that but this was just like rush
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.840]   Get those get those clicks get those those links
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.600]   Now of course we saw apple's response
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.080]   Hey johnny
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.880]   We saw apples elvis is in the building we saw we saw apple's response
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:02.160]   Uh, they said well they were doing it wrong because the reports test used safari they said and rightly so we're only going to use the
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.880]   The browser that comes with the computer when i can download a third party browser so we're in test
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:14.240]   It was safari but what we want our test to do is uh on wi-fi load pages load pages and download each time all the cash
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.200]   All the stuff so we could turn off the cash that's in the developer options
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.640]   Discovered at a little known bug which apples at all that's a bug and they apple patched the bug
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.960]   Uh a few days not so long ago like the bug was actually patched before consumer reports found it
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   But it was only released afterwards
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.640]   Well, that doesn't mean you don't patch a bug if you don't release it. Okay
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.960]   They so i just mean like they think that was their way for her to be patched
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.120]   Okay, it was it was coming in the in the update. Yeah, so it was able to they were able to quickly push it out
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.040]   I guess yeah, and uh and then consumer reports tests again and now
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.320]   It's better. It's all okay
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.480]   Yep
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.800]   Well, I mean it's not so it was a bunch of sarcastic tweets saying well my back my battery life is terrible
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.760]   And that was the whole problem with this is that consumer reports tests are completely separate from there being battery life issues
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.040]   And unless you know the tests are good it's really hard to comment on the battery life issues
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.280]   So the most important thing to me was square away those tests and we can have a whole conversation about the battery life
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.640]   Well, and and yeah, and that's I think I said I've said this a couple of times
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.520]   I still get weirdly inconsistent battery life. So what i'm doing now
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.800]   I should tell you on this show. I started with 98 battery. I'm only using safari
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   I have some other stuff running in the background normal stuff. Let's see if it gets me through the show
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.080]   The last time I did this it did not it got two hours exactly
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.120]   Where am I right now? I am at seven a since launch and it's I get about six hours
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.960]   Like consistently on just you know
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.000]   It just varies because I have I do have a bunch of background processes and sinking things and stuff. So I don't know
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.640]   You know that's the only thing I found that really like that really hurts me is google docs now because I don't have
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.200]   I deliberately didn't put chrome on it because I want to suffer
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.360]   I wanted to see whatever was happening with
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.840]   Superports initially, but I realized the other day the computer almost completely froze and was just draining
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.520]   I had like nine different windows open with three or four different google docs tabs in every window
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.720]   Uh, and those were all just just chewing away. So like it really does depend on what it's not just the browser now
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.760]   The browsers are super powerful. It's what you're doing with the browsers. Yeah
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.800]   Yeah, and I you know it's pretty clear everybody's battery life is is you know, it can be very uh your mileage
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.880]   You're like new york times. I'm gonna test a website. Let's go to the new york times
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.000]   But we do way more things with websites now than was at the new york times
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.680]   Uh, what's weird though is apple got really good battery. I mean them. It could some risk a really good battery life. Uh, they averaged
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.120]   Uh, so they tested the 13 inch model
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.760]   With the touch bar and without and the 15 inch model with the touch bar
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.000]   The new battery life results are 15 and 3/4 hours
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.560]   18 and 3/4 hours and 17s and a quarter is hours never seen that
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.760]   Uh, that's insane battery life
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.360]   Um
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.560]   That's a red flag results. Yeah more red flags
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.920]   Well, and and somebody on the john twit said I think it was uh, I can't remember who said on twit, but uh
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   Was mike elgan when have we ever tested trusted consumer reports technology reviews? Yes, they've never been very good
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.280]   I trust them for refrigerators in cars
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.640]   They're they're they're really good at things that are
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:25.040]   Easily quantifiable, but like anything that you can put on a form on a clipboard
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.760]   With somebody who is wearing proper lab attire. They're great at it or at least they're reliable at it
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:36.320]   But it really that's almost the it's by no means as uh, important a set of metrics as it was
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   Back when they were testing ibm the ibm pcxt. It's no longer what cpu is in there
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.920]   What's the clock speed of the cpu how much ram or ram is in rm?
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:55.680]   How much storage it really is? Yeah, I mean, I'm doing uh, when I I've had to totally change the way that I write camera reviews because
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.800]   There is it's really now a more about
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.000]   Sort of you know umami sort of features where how do you feel while you're using it?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.680]   Do you feel like you're using the features?
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.200]   Do you feel like you're getting the pictures that you were seeing in front of you or the pictures that you were hoping you could get with it?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.200]   You know, it's uh other you can certainly do the old fashioned
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.600]   Like 2005 style reviews where okay, and here is the picture from the the apple the apple iphone
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.800]   Uh at full resolution and here's a picture from the samson phone at full resolution and i'm gonna magnify it
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.320]   So you can see that there's more noise on this one as opposed to so that one
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.880]   Again, that's quantifiable stuff, but it doesn't tell the story of what it is
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.160]   Was it like to use each of these cameras there are cameras that can take
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.000]   Technically better photos than the iphone, but there is no
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.280]   uh camera phone better than the iphone nonetheless
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:52.480]   All right, yeah, there's nothing multiple sources checking an tech
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.040]   That cause technique i check you know the twit network see what see what a lot of people have to say
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.080]   Well, and I would also say that you can't really that
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.240]   The only thing you could do is to is to if you have an older macbook and you know what it was supposed to get
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.400]   Uh, then you can compare it to the new macbook and what it's supposed to get and maybe not just apples numbers
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:18.640]   But number you know look at an anz results for the previous the old one and then and the new one and you will get relatively
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:24.320]   You know because I never get anything any of those numbers certainly not 17 hours
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.480]   Like and it keeps saying you can take it back if it doesn't work for you. You can take it back
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.120]   Like how long do you have to do that?
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.400]   I think it's 14 days and most of us. Yeah, it's too late for me. I own it
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:40.720]   Uh, well one of the things that we like to do is like we do the one month later the two months later the six months later because there's a lot of stuff that
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.440]   You know changes over time where you learn better about like i'm gonna do my macbook pro two months later
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.720]   I think this week, uh, and you know there's a lot of things I love about the machine
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.960]   I don't use a touch bar anywhere nearly as much as I thought I would but I use touch id
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:59.920]   Continuously and I love it so like there's these things that after you've used it for a while the initial impressions both good or bad sort of stabilize
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.640]   Exactly. Yeah, which is why I have to keep this. I can't say oh two weeks and bring it back
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:11.120]   I gotta I gotta you know plus I got the custom one with the rainbow apple so I don't think they'll take it
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.760]   Somebody brought me some old rainbow stickers sexy. Oh, I love those
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.280]   Um, I do I agree with you by the way. I love touch id
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.040]   Um
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.600]   And I have yet to find a good use for the touch the touch bar of what the funniest thing now is
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.840]   I've keep editing the out features of the touch bar. You can't turn it off. Can you?
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.000]   No, I mean like you can you can do a lot to this. Yeah, but it's really weird
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.360]   Like I didn't think I'd notice this but instead of hitting escape now when I have a full screen video
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.720]   I look down and there's that little uh shrink button and it just makes sense
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.440]   I'm using them on screen and I get I get a smile every time and I hit it
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.240]   I don't need it the escape bar would be escape button be fine
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.920]   Which is having that key actually relate to what it means was enjoyable right?
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.640]   I've actually now kind of taken enough out that this moved this over because every time I hit the delete key
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.440]   I would hit the touch barn and so come on
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.240]   Everything over
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.080]   Put a smile on my face like the first time I was using it
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.520]   But then you get into things where I know where the escape key is. I don't have to look to see what is this button
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.280]   And what is it telling me this button is for?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.000]   I think it's a things a little bit of a mixed bag. I think it has to prove itself for the next year
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.240]   It's a little bit like 3d touch where
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.480]   I hope that
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.880]   I hope that developers supported in such a way to
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.720]   Make it essential important and delightful to all users
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:32.080]   But that's not going to happen until developers really figure out the best way to implement touch bar in their apps
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:37.120]   Well, and I have to admit force touch. What do they call it on the Mac? Is it force touch or 3d?
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:43.040]   Touch force touch on the Mac is still driving me crazy because I can't you know, I don't use it
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.200]   Well, I could disable it. I just don't use it. Yeah, I use it for previewing
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.280]   I got used to using it like I'll force press deep to preview a window before I promise
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.520]   You know like I'm trying to drag an icon and I'm accidentally pressed deep and no no now
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.920]   It doesn't do what I think it's gonna do and it's driving me nuts
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.240]   So I can just say I should just disable it
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.200]   The thing that's that I think is really interesting we talked about this a bit before the show is that the taptic engine on iphone
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.160]   I forget it's there sometimes and then I bring up like the accent characters and then with keyboard and I can actually feel the keys
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:16.000]   Or I can feel those little tumblers and the nintendo demo with the switch where they showed that you're holding the joy con
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.600]   I think it's called the joy con and you can feel marbles in running
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.280]   So you're like spinning around and it enough that you can count how many marbles where you can count how many ice cubes are
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.320]   So one guy said that I really want to well
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.800]   They did that in the demo and then they had a couple guys who went back and tried to use it and said like there's like there's a
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.840]   Mini game one of the new mini games. I think it's called one to go or something
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.000]   Is to count the marbles and you have to guess how many marbles when they were able to do it accurately
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   And I don't know what sort of witchcraft is going on and I can't wait till I fix it
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.040]   Because it's down
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:45.600]   But
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.440]   We've been spending so much time with physical interfaces with pixels on the screen and now voice interfaces all the sex rage
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.320]   You know, it's like elixir and syri and and quartana all those things
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.360]   But tactile interfaces are hugely interesting when you start to feel about like think about a touch bar
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.160]   That's completely tactile that has simulated texture
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.840]   Unless 20 year old technology, but it's taken until the last few years to make it real and how far they could push that
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.240]   It starts to get really usually not just for accessibility
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.520]   But just to make these devices like and these point with plugging things in just feel like objects again
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.240]   Yeah, it's super exciting. Yeah. Yeah, there's a there's a not to get off topic
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.880]   But there was a really good article in wired with the designers who are developing
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.080]   Google's version of VR and they're talking about how
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.280]   They basically are
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.120]   They have to really develop things are brand new they're bringing back skeu morphism because
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.480]   People you're in a world in which you're expected that things are real so they have to be correlate to real world objects
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.200]   And they have them so what if so what if a user has to type something and okay
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.640]   You're gonna bring up like a virtual keyboard like like in Tron or any other like, you know
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.560]   Or a minority report and have virtual hands like lighting things up
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.000]   They decided they found out that what people really like is they're gonna
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.840]   We're gonna present people with a huge keyboard like a xylophone keyboard and give them two virtual hammers
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.440]   And you just smash the keys other things you want to type and it works people like using it
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.680]   It's like, okay, it's silly
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   but it's like you're
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.560]   Fired
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.800]   We are shutting down it's like a lot of work
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:22.240]   Do you imagine how pouring a drink in VR and feeling like the ice cubes in the drink and the water
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.880]   Filling it up. I mean just feedbacks going to be very important in this touch controllers. Absolutely. That's the thing, you know, you
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.520]   You're really only getting one sense. You're getting
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.440]   site
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:39.040]   Well, not just not just that but imagine imagine this is that that VR and AR just doesn't go far enough
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.160]   I mean, I saw at the I think was at them someone who knows someone who's working at the media lab
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.840]   And he was talking to me about believe it or not haptic insoles for your shoes
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.360]   Not only for and not again, that's my that was my in it
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.800]   I I'm trained enough not to laugh at what seems like a funny idea
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.200]   But he was telling me he was telling me about how like first is if you're vision impaired
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:05.440]   How about that if we put insoles in your shoes that will cue you as to which way you need to go left or it will see that
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.760]   Because of another device that you're wearing it will see that
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.480]   The crossing light is now good and there's no traffic
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.840]   And it will just simply sort of give you a pulse from the heels to your toes saying okay
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:19.360]   So it's all right to go forward all the way to just again simple navigation for people who do not need this
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.800]   Assistant devices where you're just walking walking walking and suddenly
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.440]   It's not like you feel your feet being pulled
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:32.400]   Pulled down this street, but it is unmistakable if subtle that know you're meant to be turning right right here
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.080]   And that's like stuff that does actually that would require you to look doesn't require you to look at this
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:44.480]   Screen doesn't require you to wear anything on your face the computer is communicating things that are valuable to you without
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.600]   Forcing you to make any adaptations to what you're doing
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.400]   You're just walking down the street and you're just getting a cue that oh by the way
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.200]   Like like you're a dog and the technology is at least just sort of giving you a tug to the left
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.600]   You know, it's just and you're like well that I would like to have haptic insoles
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:05.840]   A new version for a dj pro on the iphone because as a taptic engine they actually make the beats taptic
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.480]   So if you want to you don't have to look down to see what the beat is you can feel it under your finger as it's going
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.920]   And they said it's really useful because you know, you don't want to have to look down all the time those
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.440]   Additional senses are valuable. I experienced that with the apple watch when I first used nav and it said turn here
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.800]   Yeah, that was it's what was a nice feedback mechanism
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.560]   Speaking of ar we had a demo on saturday on the new screen savers of something new from occipital
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.160]   It'll be available in a couple of months called the occipital bridge
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.400]   You know, if you've been feeling left out on your iphone because you know, we're friends with sam
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:44.800]   Sung phones are using their gear vr's and your google phone friends are using their daydreams. This is an ar
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:49.680]   A device that uses the iphone six success or seven
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:56.400]   And actually it's it's better. It's the best one i've seen it's going to be it's uh three 99
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   It's not cheap, but because it's more it's got it's it's augmented reality as well as virtual reality
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:08.960]   So see they have a all-o-clip style lens that goes over the camera. This is the infrared
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.040]   Z
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:18.320]   Sensor that senses depth. It's also hinged which is really nice. So without you know, you can easily open up the hinge on the
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:24.080]   Headset the the visor to access your phone, which makes it very easy to get into the mode
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.520]   Uh, it also let's see what uh, it's going to be compatible with the new iphone
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.480]   Uh simply by replacing that hinged part
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.720]   Um, so it's you know, it's got some upgradability there
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.600]   But the thing i loved and we got a great demo is at first it's augmented reality
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.120]   So you're using the camera so you can see the room and it could place things in the room
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.680]   and then uh, we had
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.040]   um
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.560]   My co-host nathan oliveris jiles who was on the new screensavers. He said tap the brick wall over here
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.400]   He tapped it a hole opened up and there was a bookstore in there
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.320]   And he could put his head in and now and he can move into a virtual world as well
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.480]   So it was a mixed reality device. It was a spleen resolution wheel because the iphone is not great for a screen
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.840]   I know uh, well if you're using a seven, isn't it ten adp?
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:18.080]   Yeah, but i've been a lot of uh, uh, uh, all i know are quad hd. I enjoy it is going. Yeah, it's a two or the two
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.040]   2.5
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.600]   This is this pixel is ten adp and daydream works uh fine with i think it's oh, I don't know you know
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:27.520]   I didn't try it on. I should have asked uh, there's probably a screen door effect, but i've yet to see
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.160]   I mean all of them do because you're so yeah none of them are i want you're retinoviar is going to be amazing
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.960]   Yeah, we were way far away from that at this point
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:43.360]   Um, but it also shows how much power is in the iphone seven because it was doing a better job than microsoft's hollow lens
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:52.000]   Full field of view and all of that stuff. Um, and the hallowens has a windows 10 pc built into it that a 10 chip is no joke
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.160]   really amazing
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.440]   so, um
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.640]   I this looks like I mean it's expensive but but all of these
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.840]   Systems are expensive. They have a developer edition for $4.99 and the bridge edition
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   Which is just for end users will be available in march. They say for $3.99 now occipital the company is doing this is a well
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.520]   I mean these are the guys who did red laser they've been around for a long time. They're not
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:19.040]   You know, I was really impressed by uh, their ceo and um and what they're up to
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.440]   uh speaking of battery life according to um
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.720]   apple insider the fourth beta you probably seen this also rene of amakos sira
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.320]   10 12 3 adds brightness
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.240]   To the using significant energy drop down
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.680]   Uh, you're they've done it on ios for a while. It's about time. Yeah
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:46.240]   Uh, you know and that reminded me that in order to get better battery life on this I was I was running this pretty hot
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.320]   I was running this almost all the way up
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.080]   Which I prefer, you know like a 80 battery and now if I turn it down, it's a little dimmer
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.160]   But I'm sure i'm gonna get better at battery life yet
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.040]   Much better 70 we're about an hour in 71 percent. So I will easily get through this
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.880]   Any device will spend power by radiating so that is screen brightness
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.120]   That is radios. That is yeah the heat expansion the cpu anytime you can minimize any of those things you greatly increase your power
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.920]   You will get a pop-up warning if your display brightness is above 75 percent
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.240]   Uh, you know saying you might want to turn that down if i'm gonna get better battery life
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:26.400]   Don't the test usually go to 50 every test i've seen you run it at 50 percent, right?
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.960]   They'll tell you usually it's 50 percent. I think somewhere 70 percent. Okay
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.480]   I kind of shy away from
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.240]   Trying to give numbers like that. I try to be more general in saying that
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.880]   Uh when I was trying when I was conserving energy
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.640]   Lasted for an entire eight hour workday plus into the next morning
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.400]   While I was being an idiot with power it only lasted six hours, but I remind you I was being an idiot with power
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.800]   It's it's so hard unless you document
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.640]   Seriously everything that you were doing here's what here's what the cpu settings were like
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:04.000]   You're the apps that are using here's the amount of time that the cpu was was being basically clocked at as fast as it was going to go
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.040]   Here's here's how the screen brightness was it's really really hard to get that done all
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.000]   I think that really the best that you can do is to
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:20.320]   Take the claim that apple has made and then ask yourself is this a legitimate claim or is it not
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:27.920]   Uh, and that's pretty much it. Yeah apple apparently with its battery testing runs 75 percent. Yes, I saw that
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.960]   That's reasonable. Yeah, both clicks from the bottom
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:36.560]   Yeah, because it doesn't give you a percentage so it's important to know 12 clicks from the bottom, huh?
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:44.640]   Let me run it that way here. We go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.360]   That's usable actually I I'll run it that that brightness. That's that's decent
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.480]   Again, like they changed their battery tests a couple of years ago
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.680]   And they made them much more accurate, but I still maintain that what we're doing with computers now
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.720]   Is like again with pull game long with snapchat with facebook getting batteries harder than they were back then I have
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.600]   Stu I mean my app pick is running in the background indexing everything I do now
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.920]   You know, it's kind of like another spotlight. I've got bit torrent sync running
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.320]   I've got cloud station from Synology running
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.040]   You know all this stuff's running in the background. That's got it, you know, who knows what that's doing
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.400]   Although I know when I go to my battery life it does it doesn't show it says no apps using significant energy
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.760]   That's useful. Isn't it this this little menu drop down? Yeah
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.440]   Okay inform is like outward
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:35.280]   Yeah, when they were initially testing this like the rumor I heard is that they showed it to like adobe and microsoft
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.920]   And and a bunch of people and they're like, uh-huh very funny guys
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   There's no where you're gonna ship it. They're like no no
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:45.120]   We're shipping this and we're you know, we're gonna hold ourselves accountable too. Why would they be why would they say that?
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:50.400]   Because they they know it wants to be battery-shamed. No one wants. Oh, it's battery shaming. Oh
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.600]   Yeah, that was sort of like the
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.640]   Like if photoshop is using up 90 percent of your resources
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:59.520]   Uh, and you can blame photoshop. You're not blaming apple. You know or safari you are blaming apple
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.800]   It just gives you more information and some software vendors are not really excited
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.120]   Safari is now using significant energy. I guess because I loaded another page
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.800]   Yeah, and it'll spike. Yeah
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:16.080]   Yeah, I really think you know, I still think that the the biggest improvement you can make to any
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.280]   Web browser is somewhere in preferences say you i'm going to you can say
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:28.800]   I want to limit the number of open windows to x I want to limit the number of open tabs per window to x
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.680]   And I want to limit the number of open tabs in any circumstance
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.480]   With all windows to x and because so many times this is so much of my of the end of my workday is
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:48.320]   Involved in going through every window. I've opened in chrome every tab and every window and bookmarking the ones that involve something
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.480]   I need to come back to tomorrow and closing the ones that I don't need anymore and so many times
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:58.720]   It's like oh great. I've got like 18 instances of the same google app where I've got four instances of the WordPress web app
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.000]   It's like
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.400]   Even if it's the app just simply said oh well, I notice that you're trying to open flicker.com
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:10.480]   You do realize you already have a tab open on flicker.com. Would you like me to instead take you to that existing tab?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.720]   It's like because
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.840]   It's so easy to get yourself in the weeds with all these windows and tabs and and as you as we all know
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.360]   It's like you're lucky if it only kills your battery life. It's just like oh
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.680]   I think I'll I think I'll restart right now for no apparent reason because you're really really making me feel a lot of pain
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.800]   Now and I'd like to make you and he feel a little bit of pain in return
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.720]   Let's take a break when we come back apple sets its sights on hollywood

[01:00:52.320 --> 01:01:00.480]   I was saying hi to johnny. He's our realtor and when we bought the house three years ago, it was a nightmare went on for like months
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.200]   um, I don't know why
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.200]   A part of that is because I think after uh
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.240]   The uh the housing collapse
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.760]   Uh, there were all these regulations or something or lenders are gotten very careful and anyway
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.880]   We had to submit all sorts of paperwork. We thought we had you know plenty of time
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   We were gonna want to go on a vacation in three weeks. We thought oh that'll be plenty of time
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.320]   Four five six weeks later. We're on a cruise ship trying to submit stuff

[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:59.040]   Uh this uh story comes from the wall street journal, which makes me think it's actually a leak
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:05.520]   From apple. What's happened to my computer? Oh went to sleep to save battery apple sets its sights on hollywood
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.160]   plans for original content
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   Uh, who was it? I think in that on twit. I think it was um
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:20.800]   Greg pharaoh from the packet pushers net who said yeah, apple pushed this story out to put pressure in their negotiations with hollywood
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:27.280]   To provide content for itunes and maybe even this this you know tv app that they're negotiating
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.560]   I am all sweet. It's eddy eddy. I got a story for you. I got a story. Hey, give me a having here
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.040]   Uh, I think also you could make the case that apple's looking at netflix and amazon
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.160]   And if you are having trouble getting content netflix
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.960]   I mean the suffering netflix streaming was going through because the movie company said you can't have our stuff
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.520]   It's got to be on dvd and the customers about a netflix tax encounter to now like it's for just ridiculous
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.000]   Oh, it's awful. So netflix brilliant. They said well screw that we're gonna make our own stuff
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.080]   They went out they got house of cars gave kevin spacees production company a hundred million dollars
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.760]   For a whole season and it worked really well. They they immediately monetized it with new subscribers
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.040]   Amazon has a brilliant model where they make
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.440]   Pilots for like a bunch of series and then they have pilot week
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.760]   And they watch how many pilots or you know you get to choose what gets made
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.200]   And the man in the high castle for instance they did they did the pilot and then I guess a lot of people loved it and they made it
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.280]   um both services are you know knocking it out of the park they're winning
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.920]   golden globes and
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.520]   Emmy awards. I mean really uh, it's amazon's transparent is fantastic. I enjoyed goliath
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:40.000]   They're pushing it hard. They also have the marketing engines. Why would you just add a slight price apples got the money a hundred million dollars. That's chicken feed
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.760]   My understanding is that it really is what they sorry any glad no no much much go ahead
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:53.360]   Okay, so my understanding is that it's really it's really what they say it is in that apple needs to drive subscriptions to apple music
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.440]   And in order to do that they have to have content that's compelling enough to make people want to sign up
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.520]   And music is absolutely like music exclusives as much as some people industry hate that or a powerful tool to driving subscriptions
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   But so is original content and original content and music is sort of what they're doing with beats one
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.760]   But there's this whole other vector which is original video content, which is things like carpool karaoke and drays upcoming show
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.840]   But uh, we've proven with netflix we're not with the netflix and amazon have proven that there's much bigger ways of driving
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:26.560]   Engagement than just using audio so apple sort of experimenting with the video thing and I think it's it's precisely what they mentioned
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.840]   It's like they want to get more people subscribe to apple music whether they become a full-fledged netflix or amazon competitor
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.040]   This is like just dipping their toe in the water and testing it and seeing how many people they can get to subscribe with a minimal amount of
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.120]   Really good programming they might expand that if it works out really really well or they might decide that it's good to have a few real
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.760]   Tempo things that they vary, you know different times in the year
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.800]   It's the thing that is an experiment that confuse me though. Why apple music and not items?
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.560]   Apple music is their future if their subscription service
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.280]   So if you subscribe apple music is give us money every single month no matter what
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:06.080]   iTunes is that if you'd like here are some things you can buy on demand at your at your leisure no pressure at your leisure
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.560]   We're not even gonna push ads to you. We're just gonna say
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:16.640]   Here's kishas less the latest album there it so it will be end up being more like amazon prime where you get music movies you get a bunch of different
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.240]   Stuff with amazon prime including with two-day shipping but but it's named apple music which I think
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.200]   That's a little bit of a problem because it's not gonna be music right or is it always gonna be musically
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.280]   Inclining it was like itunes was never a real problem even though it had videos. Yes. Yeah
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.480]   It's not it's sort of worse
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.640]   You know, it's I just don't yeah, I
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:44.880]   This is one of those areas where I have to be honest and say that all I all I can say is that I don't understand why apple would want to get into original
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.800]   Content beyond simply saying here are some people here are some entertainers that we would like to make very happy
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.880]   And so we don't really want to see we really don't want to see
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.600]   a musical adaptation
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.080]   Of a tale of two cities done in swing time with all 3d animation
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.480]   But we do want this person's next album and this is something that they really want to do. We want that to be an exclusive
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.400]   I I really don't understand how they could really compete against hulu and netflix
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.240]   Two organizations that are doing nothing but building content libraries doing nothing but pushing a video service
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:28.400]   Where yes, netflix has original original series, but it also has every series every every
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.760]   Every season of cheers also has every season of frayser. It has every season of uh of nbc sitcoms
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.840]   It's has every most
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.840]   Documentaries that never got into you heard about but never gotten to a theater
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.880]   Until january 1st. They also had almost every episode of colombo nhd
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.120]   Those jerks pulled it at on january 1st, but that's but that's what i'm talking about
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.480]   For other ways all money a month. That's the people who own the rights to colombo obviously
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.120]   I know like not netflix or amazon. I mean, that's the
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.760]   That's the head of the hated colombo that's the problem like that netflix has that's like not being able to buy a copy of the national anthem
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.640]   It's just not right in america. It's just not right, but that's that's sort of stuff i'm talking about it's like
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   uh, and you're talking about amazon and
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.240]   Amazon is not asking you to give them
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.280]   X dollars a month for the video services
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:24.560]   They're saying that here is everything we're going to give you if you give us this one-time payment of what's that?
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.520]   $90 a year. It's like you will get you will get a mens amount of music that you can download
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.280]   You will get an immense amount of video that you can watch and download for free including original series
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.800]   We will also give you free shipping. We will also give you access to books you don't have to pay for and it's like it's
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   you're giving people like uh
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:48.800]   You're giving you they won't be able to get to provide the absolute one reason for everybody to sign up
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.960]   But they can give everybody at least two or three reasons that work for them that will add up to 90 bucks a year
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.360]   So like I said, I don't I don't understand. I i'm not saying that it'd be stupid for apple to do it
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.520]   I'm saying that I don't understand where the upside is for them apart from we we really really like
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.720]   Richard we were all being really inspired by Richard Feynman. Here is an unproduced script
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.800]   About Richard Feynman's life that Alan Alders been trying to do
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.400]   We would love to be the people who actually help produce Alan Alders
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.160]   Biography of Richard Feynman and if it becomes an apple exclusive even better and or hey
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:31.360]   We would really want this this this performance next album this performer wants to star in a tap dance version of the great Gatsby
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.960]   Okay, if that's that's what it takes to have this great relationship with this performer. We will do that
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.320]   By the way, you need that up at a whole cloth, right?
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.680]   There is no Alan Alders Richard Feynman script or is there because I would love to
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:51.280]   There is an alnolda one man show where he performs as Richard Feynman. He's a perfect which he's a perfect person to do that
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.200]   So so far what apple has done is music focused so it kind of makes sense. They did the uh
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.440]   They did the um, you know, what is that? What is the music planos and
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   But the planet of the apps is coming
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.360]   Uh, I guess that's not using carpool karaoke. They licensed that
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.120]   Uh, the doctor's doctor's ratio. So those kind of makes sense is this but it's very different
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.240]   It's not like again
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.920]   Like they don't want to just start competing with netflix and you can make some people said they should just buy netflix
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.520]   But that what they really want to do is they're they're providing you with music
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.840]   But this gets a lot of attention when they do something like planet of the apps or they do carpool karaoke
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.720]   It gets a lot of attention and then people like oh, I want to check that out. Oh, if I watch this I get all this music
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.480]   They're just driving subscriptions and driving attention. It's the same thing as house of cars
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.840]   This is amazing. I got house like oh look at all other great stuff. I get as well
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:43.040]   It just sort of is meant to tip people over whatever little last barrier they have before hitting the subscribe button
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.480]   And there's and there's always that last problem where it's it'll be great to have if you're car
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.680]   If you're carpool karaoke fan and you really want this show that's great
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.880]   But remember that you're going to have to buy an apple tv because it's not going to play on anything else
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.200]   And is you're going to have to have another you're going to have another app that uh that is compatible with uh apple
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.120]   What probably apple music so you probably got an an android music on your android device
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.000]   Yeah, oh lord
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.520]   I'm not gonna describe anymore, but yeah, but doesn't apple at this point
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.960]   Absolutely to be absolutely fair to apple. That's everyone's doing that you can't get the amazon app the amazon video app
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.040]   You can't get the google video app. You have to right? So that's a problem. Uh doesn't
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.560]   Apple this this now if they do this really this begs them to step back and redo it all
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.600]   Redo iTunes redo apple music rebrand it apple media just fix everything bring 4k to the apple tv
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.720]   I know none of this will happen and it's just going to be continued peace-mealing
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.400]   But it sure would be it's so hard like if you look at netflip
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.840]   I have this beautiful 5k screen that I cannot watch netflix on because they will not allow netflix 4k on a computer
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.120]   Because they're afraid we're all gonna steal their 4k. So I mean like the whole thing is just so incredibly gross
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.680]   You know what a more and more loving
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.720]   Um, Nvidia makes this thing called the shield
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.680]   Yeah, an android tv device. They've just updated I had I've had the shield since it came out last year or 2015 two years ago now
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.520]   Um and they've just updated that one to the the current state
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.320]   And it now has amazon on it has netflix on it has google on it of course doesn't have apple
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:26.400]   But it has an video streaming game. So you can play like no man's land on this little teen tiny
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:32.720]   No man's sky on this little tiny thing. Um, it's just I'm it was always sitting in my cabinet
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.600]   and um
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.440]   And I'm more and more using it when I got the 4k tv I started using it because it has 4k
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.200]   Which you know and I actually took the apple tv out of there because it doesn't have 4k that's crunk cast
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.040]   This is a really nice little box and it's not very expensive
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.600]   Um that you get it comes with a joystick style game style controller
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.280]   And then you I bought the remote control which you could plug headphones into
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.440]   I'm just more and more at htr 4k more and more of course
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.200]   It's been
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.200]   It's been my it's been my primary
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.280]   Like living room box. Also, it also has a has plex built in
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.680]   You can even like use it as a not just as like a plex client but as a plex server
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.720]   So if you don't want to have like an as or a mac running
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.240]   24/7 you can just have this the same box that streams you
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.880]   His team streams game of throne through hb. Oh go
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.560]   Will also host all of your music and all of your videos and make it available to you anywhere across the internet
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.480]   Uh, and yeah, it's it's the only disadvantage is that it's it really
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   It's not difficult to use but it's not as easy to use as an apple tv or roku. It's a little bit
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.680]   I find it better. I find it easier to use. I think well, I think it's uh, I think it's better than apple
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.880]   The least revision of apple tv where you press the home button now and it takes you to what it imagines
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.000]   You want to see next as opposed to no, I just I
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.240]   Apple tv or you're turned that you're adorable
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.800]   But I I know what app I want to go to and it's none of them that you're so I'll just have to tell
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.600]   No, I really it's a quick
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.080]   I prefer uh, but I should point out
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.000]   I'm a Comcast customer and it on Comcast won't allow me to watch hboko on the nv
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.200]   Is shield I can do on the apple tv. Yeah, they just
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.640]   It's so broken. It's so bro. It's such a broken system
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.200]   um, but I but
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:25.760]   199 bucks and you can put a little it supports uh micro sd card so you can add memory even to it
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.800]   Has a little slot for micro sd cards not that I think they took that off of the new pro version
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.880]   Yeah, so I have the old no no no no the last year's editions the
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.800]   Had them I think that at ces they unveiled the version two
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.840]   Which is absolutely identical hardware but in a smaller package and you get the game controller without having to
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.640]   You get the remote without having to
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   And they also and I think they delete and I from memory serves they did delete
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.280]   Uh, the sd card slot because they felt that no one was using it that the same refrain no one's using it
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.920]   It's a way to turn using it as wireless technology
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.320]   I'm using it but it does have usb so you can actually hook up like a one terabyte hard drive to it and that's no problem
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.400]   Um, and it's tiny little thing. I mean just this little flat thing
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.360]   It's not uh, also I look you know just little things like after
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.480]   I wish that apple would like
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.320]   Understand that and vidya when it turns on there is this yellow sort of
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.960]   uh
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:30.800]   A pointy boomerang slim pointy yep green boomerang that glows up. Oh, yeah, and it's so pretty
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:37.840]   Yeah, and I like it. It's a dash of color in what is otherwise a very bleak and gray winter for me as opposed to
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.600]   We are not even going to make the apple logo on this one
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.880]   We're going to make it little more glossy so forms of right angles
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.520]   It will look like it is not completely black and what's hilarious
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.880]   It's like one of the biggest compliments we get is that there's that that light on the apple tv that annoys people and they duct tape over it
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   They just wish apple with like you turn it off
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:02.000]   I'm trying to watch a movie and it's just blowing at me. You can't win. Yeah, you can't open it. Okay, but it's it's a power light. It's like
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.720]   I would just like
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.120]   Joy but it's time to do it. It is time to do a 4k apple tv
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.160]   Break into your house and steal your tv and slap you and then take all of your cookies and leave
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.320]   Yes, so I mean that's why you ate joy so much
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.960]   There was I blew it was a powerful
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.320]   as a kid
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.520]   This box can't be upgraded to 4k, but they were they were testing a bunch of different boxes in pricing was a concern because those chips
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.760]   The apple chips or pauls have to do it were expensive back then. Well, this is two years later now
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:36.400]   The video is 200 bucks. So I mean it's a lot more. Yeah, and you put it a nine or in there and you can keep prices low
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   And you can go but like to me I was watching the tendos switch thing and I would love a version of apple tv
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.200]   They just ran on an iPad so I could dock the iPad watch my tv pick up the iPad walk off
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.720]   And there's still no handoff for app for anything really to itunes
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.560]   There's been handoff since ios 8
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.400]   But I can't start watching something in apple tv pick up my ipad walk away and keep watching it
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.520]   Like just auto magically I have to go and find it and start it again
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.320]   And just all apple has all these technologies they work for everything else and yet itunes feels like
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.640]   I understand they took a couple of years off to get the beats integration going and to redo apple music
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.840]   But it feels like they really need to start hitting all those technologies because it's a year or two later and they're just not shipping them
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:19.840]   That was a time product read it's better. It's better. It's better spending a little of that money on creating an
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.160]   unified
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.160]   media entertainment platform
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:31.200]   The hand so continuity fully everything. Yeah, uh, you can do this apple. You can do this. I know you can do this
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.920]   Take itunes of the cloud speaking of things apple could do. Did you see?
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.760]   I think this is a terrible idea, but pascal egg art
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.600]   Has created his concept design for the next
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.080]   mac pro
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.720]   And he even made a website which looks just like an apple website mac pro does it have aperture uncompromised?
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.120]   Snow aperture, but they did what he did took the round the cylinder and extended it
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.840]   So now it's a more like a racetrack oval
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:07.680]   Which gives you a room enough to put a standard video card in it for instance or standard ssd hard drives
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:11.440]   In there for instance, it looks like a black mr. Fusion machine
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.120]   It does doesn't it you could feed the top it looks like Darth Vader as toaster
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.600]   But I have to say just bring me the uh, the uh, cheese grater. I you don't
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.720]   Just I don't care what it looks like on the outside especially once I hang all that stuff off of it
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.560]   It's gonna look like a spiders nest anyway
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.560]   No pro cares what your but their desktop looks like
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   One way or another. It's gonna have like one of these on top of it like about 10 minutes after I set it up and start
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.720]   Real so who cares give me a cheese grater give me flat services that I can put post it notes on
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.440]   There's a rumor that apple's gonna update the macbook pro this year to have like the full
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.560]   Graphics and ram you know desktop ram and it's gonna be bigger and it's gonna get like three hours
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.800]   Pro the laptop pro because yeah, so right now they're like intel still does not support ddr for low power
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.240]   Uh in a laptop profile. It'll be a desktop placement
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.280]   Yes, what it'll have it'll use desktop parts instead of laptop parts, which means bigger less battery life
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.280]   But it'll make some people happy but you know until they try the battery life
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.680]   So it's gonna be another fun year. Why don't you make it with a 17 inch screen and really just go all in
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.680]   I'll bring back the battleship. Do you think that that is an attempt to
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.760]   Um
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:28.640]   Move get rid of the desktops and tired no because he's still gonna make no it's it's a concession
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.720]   So it's like almost like when they put out the the
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.120]   iPod nano with no buttons and very quickly they realize that was not a good idea
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.760]   Uh, this is there's an enormous amount of frustration
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   At least that's my read on it that that they can't do what they want to do with these machines because again
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.880]   Like things just get display port 1.3 hasn't shipped yet display
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.720]   They never mind display port 1.4
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.360]   So it's a lot of magic to make these 5k displays work and that causes a ton of compromises
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.400]   And there's no low power ddr 4 and which means that they're they're limited in what they can do in terms of memory
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.480]   If they want to hit their power profile, so there's just they're feeling like this is and you know
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:04.560]   Maybe one day they'll make their own x86 or they'll make their own arm chips or or something
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:11.200]   But they're hitting real walls with everyone from AMD and uh to intel and I think this is just reality saying
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.480]   We can't have everything that we want so we're gonna have to compromise one way or the other
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   Yeah
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.120]   Um
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.880]   Silicon is tough. It's tough
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.080]   It's tough. Another thing we talked about on sunday on twit was the repatriation
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.360]   Uh, you know friday president elect trump becomes president trump and one of the things
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.840]   Uh, he said in campaigning
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   Although he said many things in campaigning
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.960]   It's unclear what she means and which he doesn't but it was that he was going to make it easier to get the money
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.680]   The overseas money that apple and other companies have and bring it back to the united states
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.600]   Um
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.800]   That would could be a hundred twenty billion dollar windfall for apple, right
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:57.360]   Uh so much money. I mean so much money. I mean hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.040]   20
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.640]   They could spend it in europe
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.720]   But uh, he floated the idea of maybe a 10
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.600]   Additional tax on top of it
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.640]   Um, which would it's 30 percent now right at the bring it back 35
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.160]   Corporate tax rate is high. So a guy slower than a human tax rate, but it's
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.040]   Yeah, again like
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:23.120]   Apples something like 27 percent their tax their overall tax rate. They file that every quarter
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.120]   Um, so they would love to get it back. I can't imagine
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.960]   Uh, the new ministration, uh, not having a carrot and a stick though
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   Basically saying that we're not some jobs. We're we're not we're not we're not just going to make it more attractive for you to bring that money back home
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.880]   We are also going to make it way more difficult for you to keep that overseas
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.960]   Uh, and I I think there'll be a lot of back and forth before they make that work
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.880]   Uh, they're fighting
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:55.360]   They are for the american government is fighting something greater than themselves a technology technology company that has so much money
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.440]   They're virtually untouchable. Well and they have and has access to their boxes. They're global. They're global enterprise now
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.840]   So it's hard to I mean they are oh headquartered in the us, but um
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.320]   Yeah
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.960]   If germany says you have to make your german computers here in spain says you have to make your spanish computers here and
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.360]   Digerious as you have to make your nigerian computers here
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.560]   Which they're doing with data retention laws like we saw apple suffering in russia because you know you have to store Russian data here and then
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.280]   Pop when you win. He says you have to store pop when you get any data here
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.800]   It's just it's an international thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and the car industry has a lot of a lot of history with this where
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.840]   Uh to avoid it for for basic trade acts and embargoes. It's like you have to make a certain car
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.080]   In manufacturers certain car in the united states of america so they'll do like a
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.440]   Version of the Pontiac of a latte or something that has different headlights that's assembled in virginia
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.720]   And it's really not a car. They want to sell it's a car
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.440]   They're being forced to make because they want to be able to sell all the cars that they make more
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.560]   Affordably elsewhere or rather excuse me. According to their own math. They can make a more affordably elsewhere
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.000]   It's really as as much as you would like
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   companies to
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.120]   Occasionally be told the error of their ways and how things that they're doing are maybe not beneficial for
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:15.440]   uh people in general when you force a company to do something to make a product
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.600]   Uh in such a way that they don't want to make it like again like forcing
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.040]   Was gm to make an electric car in 1990s?
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.240]   Uh, they're gonna make it they're gonna comply with that law
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:31.440]   But they're gonna not do it the way that you wanted to it's not like they're gonna the scales are gonna fall from their eyes and say
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.960]   Oh my god, it turns out that we can train people to do the job of of of
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:42.320]   Assembler robots in china and it turns out that we can build tens of millions of these things in 20 days
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.960]   In a factory that's only been spun up for a year and people we've only been training for two months
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.760]   We didn't know that thank god. We're gonna move everything over here. It's gonna be no years exactly
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:58.640]   But we have to we are required to do we are not going to go one penny over that and it's as soon as we're and we're going to be fighting
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.400]   These regulations all the way and as soon as we feel as though
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.920]   Congress and or the administration has some wiggle room to say that they got what they want
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.160]   Which is the ability to campaign on hey look we brought we brought 10 000 jobs
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.320]   Uh to louisana
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.880]   Then they can say well, okay. You got what you want you can campaign on that now. We are going to slowly
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.440]   Move those people into shipping
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.960]   And give them polo shirts and train them to be apple of geniuses instead
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.400]   It doesn't it's not a great long-term plan. I think so 230 billion dollars or something like that
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.800]   I don't know what the last count is overseas. They get it back. They take 23 billion off the top. They still have
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.520]   Uh more than 200 billion dollars
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.800]   What I would like to see apple do is let take a couple billion and and do some revamp vitamins
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.520]   And make a mac pro and some but what they probably will do is buy back stock
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.680]   Right
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.320]   And you know this is a problem is that money isn't going to go towards jobs in any
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.280]   Way, it's going to go just could you know buying back stock things like that
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.480]   a bigger corporate parachute. I don't it's not like apple doesn't have enough
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.600]   It's not a change it's not a change it's allocation. Look at Brazil and India already
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.920]   Like apple's having to deal with this in several countries. Yeah, you know, Brazil was super hard to get into now
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.400]   They're doing all sorts of negotiations for India. The US is going to be added to that list. Right. That's right
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.680]   I mean, they're they're gonna invest themselves and they're also going to be buying more companies
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.160]   It's not that they're going to invent a new way
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.280]   Kind of buying my companies with and they're not exactly going out there and spending
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.440]   Well, I'm just saying that it's accumulating stuff
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.440]   If it's not as though if they read if apple repatriate or any
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.560]   We're mentioning apple, but every company is oh, yeah, mike. They're soft google too. Yeah, absolutely
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.240]   So let's let that want to be fair
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.840]   But yeah, if these companies repatriate this money, it's not as though they're going to say
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.880]   We're going to spend a thousand dollars at movie theaters and small businesses and bookshops and put it back in the economy again
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.400]   They're just going to
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.680]   Move their monopoly money around through in among us banks and us companies which in itself benefits
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.040]   Benefits us economy, but it's not as though
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.960]   Every all these jobs that we're going to be overseas are now going to be local
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.040]   Yeah, but I guess my point and that's true too
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.660]   But I guess my point really is is does it change apples overall?
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:24.320]   Strategy and I would guess not because it's not like they're hurting for cash in the us. Yeah, so I think I think it's
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.480]   I don't think it changes the game plan particularly. Maybe it does. I'm not qualified to answer that question. So I don't even guess
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.680]   Yeah
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.560]   I just I mean one of the things apple seems to do with its exit
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.080]   It's borrowed money in order to buy back shares. So the first thing you use you pay off those bonds, right?
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.560]   And then you buy more shares back
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.280]   Uh, I think it's more likely it's that kind of thing
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.680]   No, two occasional big investments like their beat steel like there'll be occasions like that
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.000]   But they buy small companies from time to time billion you have two hundred million
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.320]   What are you gonna do with that?
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.440]   Even if they spend all their money and get into real trouble while sweet'll be interested again
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.040]   Wouldn't that be funny? I don't I think you could safely say apple will never again get into trouble
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.520]   You got enough money now
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.800]   Just live on the interest apple, you know buy your tower to florida retired to florida buy a boat
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.200]   Get a hot you know these we feel like we've done everything we can with phones
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.400]   So now we have this beautiful be blasted ceramic alumia aluminum hot tub
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.840]   Oh, yeah
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.080]   When it would be great if they decided to like
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.480]   Both flex their muscles and make customers happy by saying that if you if you oh man
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.640]   I just hate the keyboard on this new back book like okay. Damn it. Well fine
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:39.520]   We spent $8,000 to build one macbook with thicker keys and we will sell it to you for the cost of a regular macbook
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.760]   Yeah, happy now
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.960]   We're taking an $8,000 loss on it, but we got we got money and we're sick of hearing it
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.840]   Here you go a couple of smaller stories. Uh, actually i'm glad about this chrome 56 adds
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.400]   native support for playing flak
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:02.000]   Audio in the browser and it's really mostly uh apple people benefit from this because uh flak playback has
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.480]   Been available on windows 10 for some time native support android has it but apple and ios and macos
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:14.960]   Have not supported this. It's a lossless format apple has its own lossless audio format apple lossless barely use anymore
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   Yeah, but but a lot of us
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.040]   Uh, you know when I when I rip music or download music i download it in flak
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:27.520]   That's an it's a lossless compression format so that I can either completely recreate bit for bit that cd
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.000]   Or more likely i'm downloading high bit rate music and I want to have it in flak because uh
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.160]   You know mp3 won't is why bother it's a forward thinking source because it's how
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.480]   When company's not going to sink it for you. It's not lossless
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.960]   So I love it that we are I could now playback flak audio in my browser
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.560]   I use uh vox as my i've kind of given up on itunes. I use vox as my
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.800]   playback uh device on my mac and mac
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:59.040]   Uh, and it supports higher bit rates in the apple if you set it up properly will support higher bit rates vox is quite good
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.680]   I think I like it's amazing because I there's people who like I'm one of the people who can't listen to music on the computer
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.120]   Because it feels like it's blasting in my face. I'll put an iphone or i'll use apple tv
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   I'll put something around me because for some reason that's less distracting to me than music coming out of the
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.560]   Out of the mac, but it's coming out of the mac. I just can't work while it's on. Yeah
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:19.040]   Weird psychological. That's you're weird a lot. I mean, I know most programmers
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.840]   I know are wearing headphones plugged into their computer is they're banging away
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.920]   Or if they work at home, they're like I have it on my apple tv because if there's a podcast coming in front of me
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.160]   I can't listen to actually I can airplay to my stereo behind me in my office
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.480]   So you're right. I often do that because I like the music coming from there as opposed to coming from here
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.400]   Um
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.920]   Vox it's a nice little cloud
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.960]   They have their own cloud the luke the loop cloud and I just I like it a lot
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.360]   It streams uh
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:52.480]   High res music. I can't remember what I had to do to make that work on I think I had to go into the midi
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   Something like the midi settings to make that work
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:03.760]   Midi that takes me back. Yeah, right? Isn't there to the date to to the days of like black scuzzy terminators and
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:10.640]   And a phone jack connector with a resistor connected to it because you wanted to terminate your your your phone net network
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.280]   I
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.680]   I'm looking in the uh
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.240]   It's not in the sound setting preferences or is it
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.400]   Uh that you can change the the the native bitrate
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.960]   Maybe they've taken that out. This is the latest macOS
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:32.880]   I don't remember how I did that. Oh well. I have to do some research
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:38.560]   Uh other couple another a couple of little uh tidbit-like uh stories
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.960]   Uh youtube no longer supports 4k video playback in safari
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.640]   Is that a is that that copy protection thing you were talking about?
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.960]   So this is this is uh some people suspect that this is google flexing their codec muscles because they have their own
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.240]   Uh video codec and they don't want to use the same like I think apples defaulting the h.264
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.760]   Uh high high efficiency video codec hevka
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:07.600]   Uh is is what some people are going to be using but the licensing fees are heavy. So I believe that's pronounced hevick
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.240]   Hook what the hook we're talking about
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.680]   Uh, it's just it's h.265. He's just they don't want to call it that
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:20.560]   Um, so it's just it's just a mess right now and it works when you're embedded but it doesn't work when you're on the the youtube page
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.360]   And
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.800]   I'm hoping it's just a bug and not an attempt by google the strong arm there a codec into everybody's browser. I hope you're right
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.120]   Um
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   Anything else you want to talk about?
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.640]   pegatron
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.800]   Maybe moving uh some factories to the us pegatron along with fox con our apples big, you know
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:46.720]   uh manufacturing arms chinese manufacturing arms pegatron chairman th tongues said according to the chinese language
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.880]   economic daily news
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:55.440]   Uh at his year end banquet that it's plants in california in indiana could be expanded to meet the needs of purchasers aka apple
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.640]   Although others use pegatron light lot of people use pegatron to make stuff
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.200]   hp and del for instance
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:06.640]   Um, I think you know it'd be very interesting if suddenly we see a lot of manufacturing jobs come back
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.440]   uh to the us
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.680]   Um, that would be good thing
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.120]   They're mostly assembly though, right? They're not manufacturing in the sense
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.440]   We understand it. I mean again
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:23.120]   You have to have a huge amounts of training and trade schools a lot of countries have incredible infrastructure for trade schools and they get people
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:29.440]   Educated on building parts for all sorts of things at a very young age and it's just as prestigious as going to an academic school
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:32.560]   Right if you don't have that culture nor the marriage that much in the world
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.480]   Absolutely crying out loud at my grandfather was 60 years old
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:40.560]   He got a job here instantly because they knew the trade school he's the metal work trade school he gone to in germany
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.720]   He just couldn't find enough people to do that. Yes
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:48.880]   Uh, you know, I we have a kid going into high school and if he wanted to be machinist
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:55.680]   And and do you do hi? I would say man. That's a great thing. Go. Don't do that. That's what you love. Go do that
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.800]   Um, but as you know as one of my best friends once once said
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:05.520]   Uh, you know this you're going to be in the workforce for four or fifty years
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:11.600]   That's a long time to do something you hate. Yes. Yes, don't don't don't don't go to business school because you think it's a better future
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.640]   Go to an auto trade school because you love working on cars because you might be doing it for 40 or 50 years
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.400]   Although working on cars is going to change a lot in the next 10 years
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.200]   I think what the in fact has already changed a lot, right?
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.360]   It's really working on a computer that's attached to it
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:32.400]   Yeah, which your your industry would have changed any in 10 years anyway no matter what industry you you went to
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.480]   Yeah, no, that's true
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.840]   That's true
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.240]   Uh, let's take a break come back and we'll talk our picks of the week in just a bit
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.640]   Um, I want to show you what I did with for my mom
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:48.080]   I you know you've heard me talk about euro the uh, Wi-Fi mesh solution that that really solves
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.240]   All those Wi-Fi nightmares of buffering and dropout
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.080]   No more dead zones if you have well mom is was a good example. I went back east into the little tech
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.640]   Uh tech day for my mother
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.800]   Uh, got her got our new mac book
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.920]   To replace her five or six year old mac book was really slowed down
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.400]   I got her a couple of amazon dots so she could uh, she loves them
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:17.280]   But one of the big problems she was saying and I I knew this because we FaceTime once in a while and actually supposed to be once a week
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.400]   Sorry mom. I owe you a call
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.040]   Um, and she'll go into the living room and call drops out
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.200]   So I knew she was having problems and then she said yeah, and I want to I want to go out in my studio
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.240]   She has a little
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:32.000]   Detached studio out back where she has her looms she weaves and knits and stuff
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.280]   But I can't because my iPad doesn't work out there. So I knew what I was going to get her for her birthday
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.520]   It's this the euro
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:43.360]   It solves Wi-Fi problems and man. I gotta tell you it works so
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.200]   Well, it's my third time setting up an euro system. I'm getting good at it
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.320]   It's not hard at all
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.200]   What happens is you get the first euro and you take out your old router plugged in the euro
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.120]   That was simple the euro has two ethernet ports on the back one that goes to the cable modem or the dsl modem
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.240]   Uh, and or your or your router whatever it is you have and the other one can go to hardware
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.280]   I put on my house. I have a 24 port switch that the euro cuts to because I have a lot of hardware
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.000]   I like to do all my tv stuff hardware if I can so the euro sitting next to the home entertainment unit
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.960]   And then I have a switch that the second port goes out to and then of course, you know
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.960]   You you set it up using the euro app on your phone, which is brilliant
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.960]   It's the it's the best way to do this, you know, by the way since mom
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.280]   I have mom's euro on my app. I can if she calls and says in Rhode Island
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:37.040]   I'm having problems with my my Wi-Fi. I can see
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.280]   Her system. I can see here. I'll show you. Can you see? I don't know if you can see this
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.160]   There it is. Yeah, it's probably too far away, but I can see what her bandwidth is
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:52.160]   I can check and let's see how the office euro is doing. It's uh, it's on it's wired. It's online
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   It's got the latest firmware
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.920]   You can see all this stuff. So I put one in her office put one in the front room
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.640]   Put one in the kitchen and then put an euro in her studio. She's got Wi-Fi
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:10.880]   Everywhere, that's what makes the euro so amazing and so easy to use euro recently updated
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.440]   You notice I have version 2.1. That's the other thing I love about euro automatic
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.000]   Transparent firmware updates. They happen all the time. That's good for security
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.960]   We know routers are you know from other companies
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.960]   Are uh are less than secure and are often not updated and if they are it's up to you to do it
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.880]   Heroes solves that by doing the updates and the latest update I got version 2
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:40.240]   Added true mesh the next generation of wireless mesh technology increased speed increased performance increased reliability
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.920]   Uh, we have at home. We have a five-year-old setup
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.600]   Because you can add more arrows
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.480]   But the basic unit basic setup is you can get an individual euro or you can get the set of three
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.560]   I love this. You know, remember I said I set her up with an amazon echo
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:58.240]   Now you got three new skills on your echo
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.320]   You can ask echo to find your phone or any device in your house and it helps because
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:07.280]   It knows which euro your device is attached to so it's oh, yeah, it's in the living room
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:13.360]   You can also ask alexa to turn off your euro led light for a pitch black room at bedtime
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:17.200]   I do that all the time. Lisa doesn't like any LEDs in the bedroom. We have one in the bedroom
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.840]   You can and this we use all the time
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.520]   Uh, the euro allows you to set take every attached device
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.880]   Give it a name and assign it to a person
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.640]   So I know all of our 14 year old's devices
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:37.440]   And they're all in a group and I can actually tell the echo I can say echo pause michaels internet
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.240]   And it will turn it off
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.240]   Michael time for dinner
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.200]   Pause his internet and it turns it off
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.200]   And oh somebody said well can he just say hey echo turn it back on no you have to go into the app
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.760]   Which is password protected to turn it back on. I love it
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.440]   We have partnered with euro to give you free overnight shipping because you know you want this and you know you want it right now

[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.840]   I just hear it all the time the wife eyes down. It's not working. I'd be watching some monephelics
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.080]   stops
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.760]   this really
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.120]   solves the euro
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:33.120]   Is a hero in my house and my mom's to ero.com. Don't forget the africa mac break for free overnight shipping
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.120]   I have I we have this these units for the ads. I have a feeling I'm gonna disappear at some point
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.880]   Somebody's gonna somebody's gonna borrow the can I borrow your euros? We'll never see him again
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:51.600]   I just I love it. This is it's so interesting how and I think this is one of the reasons and I know it's only rumored that apple's getting out of the
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.960]   Out of the router market, but I think this is one of the reasons when there's a product like this is so appley
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:06.640]   Out there apple just isn't it apple engineers. I think oh it is. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah. Yeah, I mean they it's clearly influenced by the design the packaging
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.160]   the
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:14.000]   The app everything is just if you're an apple user you're just gonna go. Yeah. Yeah, I know I know what I'm doing here
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.920]   I feel very comfortable
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.960]   Time for our and that would be really one of my picks the euro
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.720]   I think it probably was some time ago, but time for our other picks of the week
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:30.480]   Let's start with rene richy because I I I've tried this too and I'm curious what your experience has been with the little flocker
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.960]   Oh, I'm glad you pronounce that and not me. I want to be
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.560]   That's why I do this
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.560]   L
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.600]   So I I was part of I beta tested this or at least a pre-release
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.680]   it's Jonathan Zadarski's app and he
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.600]   Has been very good about developing it openly and encouraging people to try it out
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.680]   and he's
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.440]   I meant to pick it weeks and weeks ago, but he was talking about it again this week because
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.000]   That we're moving into an era where privacy personal privacy is going to be much more important because
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.840]   Regardless of what country you live in or what administration they have what their social policies are what their fiscal policies are
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.840]   It seems that almost every place
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.280]   Doesn't have that higher regard for individual privacy anymore and that's something that we're going to have to deal with as a society
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.600]   But until we do it's nice that there are some technologies we can employ as individuals
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:24.000]   And what's really nice about little flochers it gives you a very high level of control over your personal data now you do is
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.920]   I'm not sure if it's exactly a kernel extension, but it does it does go kernel deep
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:34.880]   On macos and it allows you to have control and alerts and information about a wide variety of things like for example
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.000]   If it detects any app trying to key log you it will it'll throw up a warning if it detects any sort of
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.920]   Any sort of malware or ransomware or anything else trying to infect your system. It'll give you a warning. It's basically
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.440]   Uh, it's a it's a way to try to take a little bit of
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.640]   Informational control over what is happening with your system
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:56.720]   And a lot of us do sort of like computers have become easy enough that we don't even think about it anymore
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.240]   We kind of just let them run and I know I don't like the way when I was on windows
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.040]   I monitored every little thing that was happening like just I would check and see what was using what and where was this?
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.400]   And was this malicious and I had a very high level of of alerts because it was back in the early days of windows and you had to
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.040]   But over the years I've gotten complacent and I really don't know what some of the stuff I download does anymore
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.480]   Like I know the function of the program, but I'm not as careful with it anymore
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.440]   And so I love the idea that if I really wanted to I could install it and start taking more personal responsibility
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.760]   Over my uh, my max data protection and and data integrity
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.600]   Uh, and you know how far this will go. I don't know how many people really need it
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:37.600]   I don't know, but I think that if you do feel like you might be a someone who's targeted by key logging or targeted by malware
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.400]   Or targeted by ransomware, you know the ability to preemptively install this and it'll give you
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.400]   Um, nothing is ever complete protection, but it'll give you a much higher degree of peace of mind or at least
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.640]   Uh again information that you might have otherwise if you're at all paranoid now
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.040]   I installed it when it first came out and it was a little it's kind of like little snitch where it's a little annoying
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.040]   Yes at first especially because you've got to like you know give permission to everything
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.120]   I guess it's still gonna be that way
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.600]   Yeah, and you've got to tune it and you've got to do things you've got to decide what's important to you and what like for example
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.520]   If an app wants to use your webcam, you have to give it. Oh, not just implicit permission to use it
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.960]   Which is like you still might want to mark zucker brook tape over a camera because you're super paranoid
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.960]   And that does not mean they're not out to get you
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.160]   Uh, but it'll let you know for example if an app like once in a while
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.800]   I'll see my camera on and I won't know why I'll realize it's because I launched face time on my mac and didn't really think about it
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.440]   And I forgot to turn it off, but I still have that light looking at me
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.720]   But in this case if I download an app and it wants to use my face time camera
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.760]   I wasn't paying attention
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.760]   I'll get an extra alert from little flock or my microphone or something and again
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.240]   It's just it's it's if you care enough about your privacy that you're willing to put up a little bit less convenience
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.840]   It is not the same as little snitch little snitches kind of as a firewall outbound firewall
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:56.480]   This is more like something's accessing your system files or something's modifying something on your system
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.040]   Yeah, it's it's the very privacy like personal privacy focus. You could use both though, right?
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.440]   Yeah, I mean like there's all sorts of things you like depending if you wanted to monitor network traffic
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.520]   You might want to use a little snitch any way little such I don't think at least back when I used it
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.760]   It didn't tell you about things like webcams or not. No, this is a set. Yeah. Well, that's what I mean. They're complementary
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.560]   I don't I think absolutely I think you could use both
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.080]   And if you really were paranoid, you probably would want to use both
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.760]   Yeah, and again, it's not like there's a no one apparently to this
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.160]   But we're also living in times that maybe are a little bit paranoid
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.200]   Yeah, and it's really nice and boy
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.240]   There's nobody like better than Jonathan Zadarski when he comes to this kind of stuff
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.600]   He's very if you aren't familiar with him
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.680]   He developed a lot of the techniques a lot of the forensics that are currently used in we didn't talk about this
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.280]   But celebrate which just got hacked. I mean a lot of companies took his forensic work and sort of right try to make it their own
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.360]   Yeah, so weird that celebrate got hacked. Uh, it it looks like it wasn't a
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.720]   I'm not sure how much data was exfiltrated, but yeah, you know, no data is just goes
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:54.720]   What it's one more lesson to show you that?
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   You're really screwed
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:01.200]   Little flocker it is free to try but if you want to buy it
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.080]   And he's and Jonathan's doing an honor system
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.680]   $15 for personal use $25 for business use
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.360]   Yeah, and he's an ace. Absolutely. Yeah, he deserves support for this
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.080]   I think this as I said, I tried it when he first came out with it
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.520]   It was a little rough still
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.520]   Um, and it's also was hard to get rid of
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.200]   Um, I think I'm sure it's a little it's more polished at this point
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.520]   Yeah, I mean like again, like I still can't get rid of the blackway device manager of my mac no matter what I try
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.600]   So like there's some things that go so deep
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.320]   It's time to rebuild if you yeah
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.440]   You still got the blackberry that one computer. I haven't wiped
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:38.480]   Still on there and I can't give good news his apple makes it really easy to rebuild the system
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.280]   And so much easier than other systems
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:44.160]   Uh, how about your pick of the week Andy and I come
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.840]   I actually changed my pick of the week midway through the show
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.760]   Uh, because we were talking about how annoying like apple tv like led like powerlight is
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:57.760]   And there are lots a lot of that stuff tends to happen on a lot of different devices
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.880]   Uh, I usually when I have a problem like that, including problems where I want to cover up a
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.320]   Uh, a camera on a laptop or device so I know it's not working
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.440]   I use just take a piece of a little of gaffer tape like this
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.320]   Which is like duct tape only with an undo function where it's very very sticky and it's completely uh, it's completely uh, uh,
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.800]   uh, uh, blurry so light, uh, but when you peel it off as long as it hasn't been on there for like two years
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:27.120]   It'll peel off cleanly, uh, but uh on twitter during the show after list the gardener van holt von holt who's listening to us live
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.160]   recommended, uh, something called light dims
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:37.600]   And it's actually pretty simple and cool. They're just like sheets of various shaped round and square stickers
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.080]   That you can just put over
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:45.600]   Over device lights. Uh, so they have black ones. They have silver ones. They have white ones
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:52.080]   And again in all different kinds of sizes. They also have different packs where you still want the you still want the light to be there
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.080]   You just wish you were only half as bright
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:59.520]   Well, they have versions of it that will only take a double block only half the light or only 75 percent of the light
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:05.760]   And if you have something, uh, an unusual application, they will sell you a full sheet of this stuff
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.120]   Uh, I haven't used it myself again. I've only heard about it a year and a half ago
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:16.000]   Uh, and I I admit that I'm uncomfortable with recommending something that I can hear the infomercial and or the
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:22.080]   shark tank pitch for this for this product, but it's like six bucks, uh, directly from the site
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.240]   We're through through amazon, uh, in all these different sizes and varieties
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.240]   That's kind of worth having around again if you need to it's it's if you don't have if you don't have gaffer tape
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.200]   Or if you don't want to have something that you just spent 500 dollars for with a piece of gaffer tape on it
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:41.280]   You want something that looks kind of a bit more professional, uh, this is kind of interesting
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.760]   I just ordered to pack myself just to try them out and they have
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:47.680]   Uh, complete blackout, but they also do they have like some that kind of just dim it
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.320]   So you can choose what you want that's a 50-80 percent, uh
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.240]   One's 100 percent. They can really choose what you want to do, uh, and different colors so it'll blend in
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:04.720]   So dikty bar tollo recommended these if anybody has more led shining in his house
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:10.800]   It would be dikyd, uh, and he recommended these, uh, so he's he uses them and he says they work great. So
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.400]   Light dims dot com they make me feel it so i've got little friends hiding in the house
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.120]   Little l-l-e-dide friends
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:27.360]   Hiding in the shadows, uh, lisa's, uh, my wife has a, you know, really strong aversion to any light or any noise in the bedroom
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:30.880]   Uh, and i'm used to having like lots of little lilies everywhere
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.800]   So i've had i've sanitized it and you know what she's right i sleep much better
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.560]   Without those little blinking lights so i've i've actually i don't use light dims
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.320]   It just got everything out of the bedroom also also because i've got the like a
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.320]   A little reason i bought these is that i have like a a video box that is like a
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.320]   I bought on ebay. It's like a you know cheap thing that does it does a job for me
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:58.320]   But it has this blue led that i only notice when i'm trying when i turn off all the lights in the bedroom
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.360]   So i'm going to bed and then i see this like blue glow that's actually bright enough to like wash
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.040]   That corner of the of the bedroom and so i would kind of like to be able to cover that up
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.000]   So
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.960]   Now i'm doing it the professional way not the way that rank amateurs use to it and black electrician safe
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:20.960]   This isn't this isn't a sort of thing if you pay a consultant 500 dollars an hour to solve your av problems
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:26.080]   You're hoping he doesn't just come in with a cafeteria or only as a professional product perfectly round little dots like like
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:34.400]   I am torn i have two two uh two picks one from the good old days and one from the future
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.840]   So i'll start with the one from the past from hackaday somebody has ported
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.680]   portal
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.680]   To the apple to computers
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.120]   You can actually play
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.520]   One of the greatest games of all time on the very constrained
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.880]   Graphics of the apple to
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.400]   Um, you know the way portal works if you've not played it and if you haven't go out and get portal
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.680]   It's just no load runner, but oh, I wish you know what why isn't there a good load runner
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.680]   Out now for the mac or something. I would play load runner for it
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:12.560]   So the idea portal is you have a special portal gun
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.360]   There are two kinds of holes you can open an exit hole and an entrance hole and allows you to move around them
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.560]   The puzzle maze with your with your portal gun by opening those holes up
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:30.400]   Um, and it's frankly something that I I've been using for some time to get around the studio because frankly it's it's very hard
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:36.640]   This is patrick's portal gun that is nice from aperture lads
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.760]   If you go if you go to if you go to a not go.com I changed uh, I got picture
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.160]   I got a picture of myself during my trip to dc
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.480]   That I've made the header image on my facebook page and on my blog
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:51.120]   That's so great
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.560]   I felt that was I was as soon as I saw it
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.960]   I felt that I know what picture I need to have taken of me
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.440]   And I know that everyone I know will be sick of seeing it
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:05.040]   So yesterday in triangulation we had the legendary jordan ritter who is of course
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.880]   Um, I mean I can go on and on he's a multi multiple
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.040]   serial entrepreneur
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.200]   He was one of the three with shawn fanning and shawn parko created napster
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.840]   Brilliant programmer security guy hacker and his latest
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.280]   Uh, enterprise is called atlas recall
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:28.480]   And it's funny because I had tried it before I'd put it on my computer before
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:35.040]   He uh, he came on the show. I didn't know he was part of it. Let me go to his website was atlas.com
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:42.400]   And uh show you this is free right now mac only the idea is it it's kind of looking over your shoulder
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.080]   Watching everything you're doing and making a searchable index of all the things you see
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:56.000]   From messaging from email from websites everywhere. It has a plugin for safari and a plugin for chrome
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.600]   So if I do a google search, uh, let's do a google search for andy and not co
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.960]   Something I do regularly. It will pop up
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:13.760]   Uh, an atlas search in my recall history for for documents associated or with your name in it or somehow associated with it
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.280]   Um, this is free because it's a beta. It's early days
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:25.760]   He wants to if you watch the interview he wants to make this a platform that applications can integrate into there's an atlas recall app for uh,
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.960]   Ios
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.760]   Is not available yet on windows or linux although he's working on that or android, but I love the idea. He says it's your data
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.800]   Everybody else is spying on you the nsa probably has a database like this
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:46.080]   Shouldn't you have a database? Um, they it's encrypted in place. It's encrypted in transit. They uh, you know, they're very careful to say
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:52.400]   You know, we don't do anything with your data, but you should be aware that it was one more place your data lives that could be I guess
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.800]   subpoenaed by government sources. So if if you're worried about privacy, you might not want to use this
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.560]   But I really think this is great. Once you once you've been using it for a while
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.960]   Uh, you know, you can say oh, what was that thing? I was we were talking about dimming
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:11.040]   And I can't remember that that thing was called dims or something like that and you can search for it and it'll show you
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.160]   The pages here here. They are talking about it in chat picks up irc as well
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.560]   Here's the dims page
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.720]   So you don't have to remember
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:26.160]   Everything that uh, you know, it's just remembers for you atlas recall free right now
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.520]   So it's a good time to take advantage of it. It's mac and ios only
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:34.240]   Although it will eventually and I certainly plan to put it on all my devices because then you'll have a kind of
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.640]   His his goal ultimately is to say
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:42.000]   Well, you know, I do this. We all do this. We have multiple copies of a single file one on our local computer one
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.480]   Maybe on dropbox all over the place. He says you could have one copy of anything
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:51.280]   And know where it is and it will look like a unified file system on your computer
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:58.800]   You don't care where it is is long you can access it anytime. So I think this is a really good idea atlas.co if you'd like to try it out
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.400]   For free
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.000]   We are out of time
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.640]   But thank you everybody for being here rene richy at imore.com

[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.640]   Yeah, they don't make iphone announcements there. That's for sure
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.400]   They'll probably be somebody with a an iphone 8 dummy in a case somewhere right right every year

[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.920]   I will I fell so much in love with a single deployment that I haven't really been switching my apple fans as much as I used to
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.160]   Get that one. It's just so comfortable and easy to use it you unclip it and it comes right off
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.880]   Oh, that's the it's expensive though, right? That's it is. I'm sure people make cheaper versions of single deployments
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.560]   They do but I just it's got the best of yeah
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.440]   It's not the best of a link and the best of a leather kind of sewn together best of a link and the best of a leather sewn together
