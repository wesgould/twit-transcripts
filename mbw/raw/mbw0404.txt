[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Almost at Zoom. In one show, all compacted into one show, there he is, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Good to see you, Andy. Something's missing.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Gracie LA?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Gracie LA, a poule ba la ning ding ding ding ding. Andy's here. So is Alex Lindsey in studio today.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Come back.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We'll look at the question engine up and running.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It's running.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Whenever Alex is here, we'll get you the URL in a sec.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And from imore.com, Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Leo Andy.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Hey Renee.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Question engine is a chance for you to ask questions of this fine panel.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Alex developed it at the Pixel Core and he kindly lets us use it when he's here.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   But we have to use a special URL because it's a very long.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We're working on that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We can fix that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We got a new version coming out in a couple weeks and it'll fix that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We'll fix that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   All of that.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We're going to run our own.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We have our own shortener.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We just couldn't figure out how to use it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We could just switch to a different numbering system.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We go to a base 8 or even a base 11.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That'd be awesome.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   We could get ahead of the people.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We could get, yeah.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I think that's great.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Let's go to base 7.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Oh, just random numbers.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Just random.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yes.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   This is episode 47321.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Hash is perfect.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   We'll hash that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We keep track of that.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And salt it so you'll never know what to expect.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   But it's secure.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But it is secure.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   No one will ever guess our number.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Hey.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Or maybe people could just agree not to be jerks.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I know that would be harder than having hash numbers.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Stop it.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Live walk a mile in my shoes, Andrew.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Dealing with humans here, Andy.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Wawa Dasa, WWDC is coming up Monday.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It is.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He note, we now know 10 AM.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Mark Gurman 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   He's only 20, but he has really good contacts.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm sorry, Mark, but I still am kind of like amazed that you are such a young person.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And yet so successful.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He says new hardware will be announced.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But the interesting thing I'm seeing the rumor, and I think this is, you know, this is one
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   of those rumors that is either wildly true or wildly untrue.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That's actually our number one question here.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Apple to said this is from TechCrunch, which has gotten a few things wrong lately.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They've not got a perfect track record.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Apple said to be prepping smart home software platform for WWDC.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And then they show three devices Apple doesn't own the nest, the hue, and the belkin.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   But that's with such thick stone walls that Bluetooth, low in E is not going to work at
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   all.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What a home.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Is that Hampton Court that looks like Hampton Court?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   What is that?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I think that all I can say is I think that that would be a lot harder to automate that home
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   specifically.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Actually, because there's no metal in the walls, it might be perfect.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   No rebar.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   No showering off of I-95 and brain tree that looks a lot like that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't know if that's where they got the wrong.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Could be actually brain tree.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I think the Financial Times, Tim Bradshaw was reporting that too.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   And the FT is the one that broke the, and we can't read it because the FT is behind at
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   paywall.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I refuse to give the Financial Times my money.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's not money.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   They just want your registration.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Are you in Safari?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Look at what you get when you go to the Financial Times.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Are you in Safari?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Uh, I didn't pay set to Safari.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Cut pasted in Safari.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Safari goes around this.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   If you have it, do the reader.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Oh, you can actually read it.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   The reader just goes, I will ignore all of this.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Stupid paywall.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Enter your email address.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Select an access level or...
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Don't read the article.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Financial Times is the same group, same organization, same fine journalistic entity that claimed
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   that Apple was buying beats.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So, I don't know what to say.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   They're doubling down, Leo.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It doesn't happen sometimes.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Renee and both Renee and Andy have sources at Apple that you get a phony source that
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   starts giving you crap.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And it takes a few bad leaks to realize, this guy's not working on Apple.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I don't think any of us would report on a single source, though.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Really?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Yeah, I wouldn't report on a single source.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The beats felt like everybody and their brother was saying that this was going to happen.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I think it was a lot of people, dog piling on early reporting that seemed to come from
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   people that were sticking their necks way, way, way, way out that kind of encouraged a
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   lot of people to suddenly start thinking, "Okay, well, does it make sense to me that
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   beats would be bought by Apple?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I bet I can figure out why it makes sense, and that's how you get your column out."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah, people like Harry McCracken said, "I don't know if it's true.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I don't think it's true at Time magazine, but here's why I hope it's not true."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   That's kind of what I was saying.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   We still, by the way, Week 3, Apple held hostage.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   No beats deal.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Week 3, Apple is still not the beats.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.280]   That's why it's so much fun to look at how the coverage is evolving, because Week 1 was
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.480]   people saying, "Well, of course, because headphones are a really, really profitable
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.680]   market space, and Apple absolutely has been re-earning to get into the accessories game,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.240]   and then Week 2 with no announcement."
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.480]   Well, it's obvious that it's not about the headphones.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.400]   It must be about the streaming service, and then end of Week 2, well, it must be a grab
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.000]   for the executives.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.560]   And now we're in Week 3.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.720]   This is where you get into Stockholm syndrome, where people are saying, "Well, I know that
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.520]   I told you that this was definitely happening within a few days a couple of weeks ago, but
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.000]   now I have exclusive story about why it's not happening.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.200]   Now, here's how Dr. Dre got Tim Cook really, really angry.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.640]   I can't tell you the source, but...
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.800]   That's the new one, isn't it?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's, well, it's not happened.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.840]   Maybe not it doesn't happen, because...
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.040]   So gosh, we could just go through the chronology, but let's...
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.440]   All right, I'll come...
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.960]   Okay.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.760]   So, I told that thought, "Well, pop the stack later, but I'll push another thing on the stack.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.880]   We'll pop the WWDC stack later."
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.320]   I love fourth jokes.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.240]   Push beats, since we got on this.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.640]   So five days ago, TechCrunch said, "Oh, it's happening, but it's an aquire for Dr. Dre."
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.520]   Which makes less sense than I/OV.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.600]   It makes more sense as far as an aquiher.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   Not even Dr. Dre.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.680]   Look, the guy is very, very wealthy.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   So don't...
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.360]   It's one thing to buy a company, you know, for $10 million, and you get the engineers,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.200]   and you get the...
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.560]   Dr. Dre doesn't really need beats.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.840]   I think in beats is probably not more than 10% of his business time.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.200]   He's producing records.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   He's making...
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.640]   I mean, I don't...
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   He's making videos.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.760]   I don't know if you get Dr. Dre, really, if it's five beats.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.280]   It's a big chunk of his revenue, of his income.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   I mean, the...
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   And Jimmy Iovine.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.320]   I mean, they didn't put Jimmy in the picture of the headline, but Jimmy Iovine is the source.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.200]   They want Jimmy, and they want Dre.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.800]   He's got fashion and culture completely locked up.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   On Sunday, we talked about this, and Brian Brushwood said, "I'm just an old to me.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.480]   You're just an old man, Leo.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.680]   You don't get it to you.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.840]   Apple's still cool, but to the kids today, the white headphones are meaningless.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.920]   You got to get fashion.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.160]   You got to get hip.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.400]   You got to get Dre to appeal to the kids today."
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.000]   Well, and one thing that I will say that I'm happy to see Tim Cook doing is rather than
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.720]   having it all be one person that is the tastemaker for all of Apple, which is where it was when
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.040]   Steve Jobs was there, I do think that what we're seeing with Aaron's being hired with
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.880]   possibly these being acquired is that what we're seeing is an expansion of.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   We're going to have a bunch of different people, a bunch of smart people in the room,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   making decisions about what this looks like.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.920]   I think there's a lot of cultural problems.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   I think that...
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.440]   It feels to me more like you're chasing style, and this is exactly what...
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.760]   At least I and what I think Twit represent, which is we're not going for what's cool,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   what's hip, what's happening.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.880]   We're saying here's what the best stuff is, regardless of the veneer over it.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.320]   To me, if Apple is saying, "Hey, the only way we're going to succeed is having a veneer
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   of hip fashion."
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.680]   What is beats where the hockey puck's going to be?
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.640]   Beats is not where the hockey puck's been in a long time, in my opinion.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.440]   I do think that...
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.120]   I don't know if you guys might have more information, but I believe that one of the problems that
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.840]   Apple's had is it's not just that they don't want to do a subscription service, they just
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.920]   haven't been able to lock up those deals.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.480]   So this might be a music...
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.320]   We've talked about this before, the idea that the music industry might be supporting this,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   right?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   Questions?
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.320]   Questions.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.320]   You changed this.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   There we go.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   Now I got it.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   All right.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   But the...
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   Sorry, I think that getting into that, and I think that it allows them to experiment
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   with it.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.120]   I think that the subscription service Apple has to come out with.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.880]   I mean, they have to move to a subscription service.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   I mean, that is the future.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   I haven't bought anything since I got Spotify.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   So I mean...
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   Go ahead.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   I don't know what's going on with beats.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.920]   I don't know the reasons why Apple's...
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.960]   I would never say with certainty that I know why Apple's going after it.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.080]   I do believe something very, very clearly that they don't buy a $3 billion company, especially
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.200]   one with that such an established brand to get a product or even a product line.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.400]   It really is about here is where we want to be five years from now and 10 years from
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.960]   now and what pieces are we missing to get there.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   So that's...
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.760]   If and when this happens and if and when they explain the reasoning, it really will...
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.720]   When we look back on Apple history, it'll come out to, okay, clearly they wanted to do
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.920]   more than make hardware and even sell individual intellectual property.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.160]   They wanted to actually be in the business of managing and profiting off of the content
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   itself.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.080]   Well, and I think that there's an opportunity to...
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   I still think...
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.320]   I may be way off, but I still think that there's a real opportunity to go to 24-bit audio,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.880]   to take those headphones and actually make a line of them that's actually high quality.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   I mean, not just a lot of bass, but really, really high fidelity and look at a subscription
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.840]   service that is a higher priced...
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   That'd be Apple's way of doing it higher priced.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.160]   This is such a bogus rumor.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   It's such a bogus rumor.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.600]   I think people do dumb things, Leo, is going to haunt you one day.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.440]   Yeah, it's just difficult when people are saying things with absolute certainty that
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   they know exactly why Apple's doing something.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.520]   They know exactly that this is happening.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.480]   I still haven't written about it yet, chiefly because there's...
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.040]   Every time I try to look into things that we can actually prove and like Renee, I mean,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.600]   there are people that will talk to you under the proviso that they're not going...
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.400]   You're not going to use the information that they give you directly, that they're just...
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.480]   If you just know that all I'm looking for is a reality check on things that I'm thinking,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.880]   and not even the people that I've been talking to will...
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.120]   Has anything that makes me certain about any of this.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.040]   So I think that we need some distance from this at this point and we need us to wait
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   and see what happens.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.840]   Yeah, let's wait and see.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.120]   Okay, I, for one, will take the pledge not to bring it up ever again.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   Sure.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.920]   At least not until next week.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   Not until next week.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.040]   I do other folks at ITProTV for my giant look.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.280]   My swimming pool coffee cup.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   Tim and Don, thank you.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.480]   Push one more item on the stack, then we'll pop it.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.560]   Where is Andy's hat?
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   That's question number one from the questions on air team.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.360]   You can show this, Chad.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.040]   Where is Andy's hat tech for hire pose this?
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   But it got 14 up votes.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.200]   The up votes are what makes us a question pop to the top.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:35.040]   I will tell you that I usually shower three to five times a week and almost never on Tuesday
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.920]   because I've got lots of things coming on Tuesday.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.720]   Today, I happen to shower and shampoo and condition and whatever.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.560]   And so I wear a hat on camera when I feel as though my hair is an absolute fright.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.640]   When it's not a total fright or at least beyond my standards of absolute fright, then I believe
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:57.160]   that you don't want to be the guy who refuses to be seen without something on their head.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.040]   Chad says, forget the hat.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.800]   Where's the squirrel?
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   He's with the hat.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   Both getting along.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.000]   He's in Tokyo working on a Pixel Core project.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.360]   I'm going to say done.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   He's on the NDA.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360]   I didn't.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   So I'm not allowed to.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   But there's your answer.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   I'm collecting the done button.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.560]   We're going to pop the stack one more time and move to, let's see, we pop that pop beats.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.640]   Now we're back to WWDC.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.040]   Thank God.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.440]   So what about this home automation rumor?
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   Is that credible?
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.720]   That seems to be credible anyway.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   I think so.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   I think so.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.240]   It seems like it's especially the way that it's being presented, that Apple's not coming
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.440]   out with a line of home automation accessories.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.520]   They are simply going to create a specification, an API and a licensing thing, so that if you
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.960]   want your home automation, whatever it is to support iPhone at that intimate level, here
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.040]   are the tools to make that happen.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.240]   I think that this is a, it would be kind of ahead of its time at this point for Apple
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.480]   to do that as a real line of products.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.280]   But they're certainly willing to make sure that if this takes off and becomes a thing,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.480]   that the iPhone isn't left outside.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.880]   Google's been rumored, in fact, Google was made out, made products along these lines.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   Google's bought Nest.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.000]   So I think everybody's planning to be in this space, I'm sure.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   How do you got home automation?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I mean, I know from me I'm waiting.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It's been a while.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.400]   We're waiting because it's been a flop because there's so many conflicting standards.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   There's no clear winner.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   Exactly.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.840]   And that's usually where Apple does a pretty good job at capitalizing on that because
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.560]   there's a lot of iPhone users like me that would love to have my iPhone control.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.200]   When I walk in the door, I want to unlock the doors.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.000]   I want to have a keyless experience.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.160]   I want to be able to change my lights.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.040]   I mean, I want to be able to do all of those things with my iPhone.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.360]   I don't want a bunch of different little bits and pieces.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.720]   And I think that it's a huge opportunity for Apple.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:52.920]   I've been rooting for this smart things, but if Apple got into it, that would kind of
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.760]   change the game for them.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.640]   Unless Apple acquires smart things.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.720]   See, this would, to me, this was a smarter acquisition, say, this is a startup that's
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.120]   focused on, you know, and they already have products, but the idea is focused on, and
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.520]   they were, here's another thing.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.880]   They interoperate with existing standards like ZigBee.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   So this works with your WeMo, this works with your Hue, this works with your Sonos.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.160]   I think the idea that one thing that works with everything is a great idea.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.680]   But I agree that an Apple could do this better than anybody.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.400]   My only fear is that you have to have an iPhone to use it or an iPad.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   That's exactly it.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.800]   I mean, it's a lot of people wouldn't.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.960]   People love Nest, but if you can't make the Nest do something cool unless you have an
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.920]   iPhone, that's a deal breaker.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.160]   There's almost no point in doing it if it's an exclusive sort of thing.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   Well, for you.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.720]   I mean, there's a lot of iPhone users that just wouldn't care.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.640]   I mean, it's like they would care whether it was cross platform or not.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.080]   They'd be like this is cross platform.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   Apple has pieces.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.520]   That's fine if Apple wants to make its own line of thermostats.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.040]   That's fine if they want to make their own line of light bulbs.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.080]   But it's, I think, I think Apple is cognizant of the fact that it's not an Apple dominant
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.400]   world out there anymore.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.960]   And if you want to create something that real consumers are going to be able to get their
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.600]   hands on, you can't trust that they only have iPhones and they only have iPads.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   I beacon is cross platform.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.320]   I'm my beacon said in the office right now as a matter of fact, I'm playing with so that
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.920]   it could be based on Ibekan, for instance, Ibekan is an Apple thing that other companies
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.080]   have figured out how to use.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.760]   So it's not necessarily set it up.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.000]   But the thing I like about this rumor so much is that the way it's set out is smart.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.280]   Originally, it was being reported sort of like home play like a version of car play
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.960]   that would work on the houses.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.040]   And air play car play is an interface projection.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.280]   It's letting iOS take over your screen.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.520]   But for home automation products, there's, you know, most times there's not a screen.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.400]   That's not a very compelling idea.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.920]   But what there is is it sounds like it's going to be based on the made for iPhone, iPad,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.280]   iPod program, MFI, which is a long standing program.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.760]   It's how original iPod is interfaced with cars and with home stereo equipment.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   And it's basically you have to sign an NDA, but then you're part of the program and it
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.480]   allows for best experience with an iOS device.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.560]   And I think that answers a lot of these questions.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.600]   I remember talking to Sonos years ago and they said they weren't working on their own
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.320]   controllers anymore because making a controller for the iPhone was such a better experience.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.680]   And if Apple could ensure that, like, I never thought it would be a good idea for Apple
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.760]   to buy Nest, Nest would be a horrible idea for Apple.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.680]   They don't have to be in the thermostat business, but they can be in the business of making
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.000]   sure that every smart connected device in your house has a potential to work incredibly
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   well with iOS.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.880]   The same way car play is great for iOS.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.480]   If you don't have an iOS device, the Q and X system in the car will just work with whatever
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   smartphone you have.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.840]   But if you have an iPhone, you get all these extra features.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.360]   And with an MFI program, if the company signs up for it, your device will just work so much
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.760]   better with an iPhone.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.320]   And that, to me, makes us a believable rumor.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.600]   And I think for a lot of these, when you look at the home automation is just the tip of
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   the iceberg.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.520]   I think that really what you're looking at, I know for me again, that I'm always looking
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.120]   at the dryer, the washer, the refrigerator, the microwave, all of those other things,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.040]   I find it remarkable that the only thing that I really have connection to my iPhone and
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   my house is my barbecue.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   You know, like, I grill.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.080]   You know, so the thing is, like, I'm like, this is crazy.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.960]   I mean, in a house, and the only thing that I can do is cross-platform works on Android.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.920]   Smart things works on Android.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.000]   So no works on Android.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.360]   So I don't think you have, I think you can do MFI made for iOS and just as these guys
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.680]   do and still across platform.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.080]   I think that would be important, frankly.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.320]   And it cooks cross-platform.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.760]   My friends have a Nexus system at home.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.360]   They can unlock their door using their smartphone from across the world.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.280]   And it's fine if the best experience is on iOS, you know, that's not necessarily a...
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.120]   Or Android could compete to have a better experience than they're both competing against each
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   other.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   Good for us.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.880]   And the standard operating procedure for Apple in the past would be that we'll play with
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.120]   everybody until we're 80% of the market and then we'll, you know, roll out something
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.360]   that's much more specific to us.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.720]   Acknowledging this is a complete rumor.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.400]   I like this rumor better than the Beats rumor.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.200]   It makes more sense strategically.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:10.360]   It is more of a global, the kind of global thing Apple likes to do where it says, "Let's
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.400]   find a market and because we're Apple, we can move into this market and be a market maker."
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   Right.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.280]   And that's one of the reasons I like this.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.200]   Beats is following, saying, "Oh yeah, these other guys did it.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   So we're going to..."
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   That's not Apple.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.280]   Apple says, "No, no, we're going to figure it out.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.000]   We may acquire pieces to put it together, but we're going to make the ecosystem."
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.320]   And I think that makes a lot more sense.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.920]   So this rumor I would believe, and it does also the kind of thing you could see Tim Cook
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.000]   just loving to get up on stage and said, "You know, remember those new categories I was
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   talking about?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   You guys got it all wrong.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   I didn't eat a TV.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.200]   They ain't going to watch.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   It's this."
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   Apple revolution.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Well, and I think that one of the things that they would bring you back today was...
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Your story, they like to say...
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   Ten controllers from 1987.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   You're welcome.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Remember X10?
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   Nah.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   But I think also that the...
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.560]   I think we may look back and look at Siri, the hobby or beta or whatever they have and
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.960]   now some of these more series, something very useful in these types of things.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   So being able to talk to your house and say, "Turn on the living room lights," or do you
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.040]   know, all of those other things are things that Siri becomes much more useful for, and
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:25.160]   it's been able to develop itself with people using it that might be kind of interesting.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.960]   What about Dropcam?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   There was a rumor that Google...
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.480]   See, Google, I feel like Google and Apple, this is the next battleground.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.400]   It's a smart home, right?
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   Google has been rumored.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   Google acquired Nest.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.000]   They're rumored to be looking at Dropcam, which we love.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.160]   These are those Wi-Fi enabled cameras.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.240]   We use them all over the place.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   We have eight or some.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   It's part of the Nest division.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.320]   For some reason Google owning Nest doesn't bother me, I have a Nest.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.920]   Google is owning Dropcam.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   I would probably...
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.760]   I didn't think of that.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.280]   I didn't think of that.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   I'd probably show it.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.760]   Oh, wait a minute, but Apple bought Connect.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   Right, so...
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   Apple's got a camera.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   It's the old Connect Company.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.920]   Yeah, but Apple's got a camera too.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   No, no.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.760]   Camera on my...
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.000]   Here I have my Dropcam from a security perspective.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And all the stuff I'm just like, "Mmm."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I don't know this.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   It's sort of a toss-up.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.560]   It's sort of a toss-up between not wanting the single most aggressive we want all the
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:30.440]   data we can get company to own this camera company versus do you want a tiny, underfunded,
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.560]   comparatively underfunded company to be responsible for making sure this thing is so secure that
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.720]   nobody in Russia...
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.600]   No Russian hacker group can find an exploit to basically canvas your entire house without
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   your knowledge.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.680]   That's the thing that always worries me whenever I get one of these things to sample.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.920]   It's like, "Okay, how many employees do you have?
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   Nine?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.680]   Okay, you're going to tell me the security credentials of every single one of these people
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.360]   and why I should make sure that there is not a weakness in this software that a random
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.880]   PQ guy can exploit."
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   Right.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   Right.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   All right.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   Well...
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   What else we can see?
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   The question engine says, "Lio, why don't you just buy a Mac mini?"
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.400]   This is the top question, by the way.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   So we can be guaranteed to see a new one at WWDC.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   Good, Leo.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.000]   Because I'm waiting for the new Mac mini.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   I love this.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I would love a Mac mini.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.120]   But you're the only guy who buys them in quantity.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.360]   There's a lot of people who buy a Mac mini.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.440]   You see them everywhere.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   I mean, they are...
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.000]   Well, it is the cheapest Mac.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   By far.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.440]   Not only the cheapest Mac, it does a lot of processing in a very small amount of space.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.000]   It's used in glue.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I mean, you see them...
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.480]   I'm in production locations all over the place.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   You see these little Mac minis.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.000]   They're much more popular than Mac Pros.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   They're small.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   They can put them in there.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   They can have them do a lot of small processes.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.920]   They're very, very popular, I think.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.080]   Maybe Apple knows something.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080]   Obviously, Apple has a sales number.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   There'll be Apple disagrees.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.720]   When was the last update two years ago?
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   It's been a long time ago.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   500 and something days.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.080]   500 and something days, yeah.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.880]   Who wasn't that blog that had a happy birthday to the congratulations of the Mac mini being
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.520]   the Mac that's gone the longest without an update?
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.200]   Longer than the Mac Pro?
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.480]   520-something days?
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Wow.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.320]   Well, the Mac Pro has been updated now.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.480]   No, but I mean, but it did.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.160]   It wasn't like three years between updates for the Mac Pro.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   So it's been long.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   I think it is long.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.280]   I felt the pain there.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.000]   Very happy with the new Mac Pro, by the way.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.880]   It's been running like a top.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.160]   Once we got that RAM.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.560]   Yeah, well, it wasn't the RAM.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.360]   This whole thing was messed up.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.520]   Then another stick died.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   So the whole thing was messed up.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   So Apple swapped it.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   Okay, very good.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   And now it's running great.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.040]   And I'm running two cinema displays with one 4K monitor.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.840]   I don't know how many square inches there, but that's a lot.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.000]   Doing with all those monitors.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Oh, it's great.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Now, oh, this is living.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.160]   Now, I finally realized what I wanted a Mac Pro for.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.880]   I've got Windows in one of them.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   Right.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.600]   Humming along with 4GB of RAM, no problem.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.040]   I gave it two processors.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   No problem.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   Running along.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.280]   I got my chat room.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.520]   I got the Twitter.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   I got email.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   I got my calendar.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   I got all this stuff open.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   Right.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.360]   And then I sit there, go ahead.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   [LAUGHING]
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.200]   It's an ADD paradise.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.560]   And now I know, because remember I was saying, okay, when the Mac mini new Mac mini comes
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.320]   out, I'll do an AB comparison, blind comparison, see if I could tell the difference.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.640]   Now I know I would, because there's no way it would drive all those real estate.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   That's right.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   Officially.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.920]   I can play Civilization in one screen, have the other two screens.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   Of course.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   So I think there's an opportunity.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.560]   I mean, they did well with the Mac Pro.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   I think there's an opportunity.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.840]   Do you think a complete redesign?
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.000]   Like maybe they're doing a cylindrical Mac mini.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Oh, I hope not.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.880]   I mean, you know, I think that one of the things that makes the Mac mini work is the
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   fact that it's rack-mountable.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   I mean, it's, you know, that's part of the--
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.360]   Well, let's put ears on it.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.160]   Let's make it-- let's go all in on it.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   Let's make it a one U.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   I love that.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   I mean--
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.240]   Yeah, but I don't think they're going to do that because I don't think they're interested
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   in that.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   They kill that business.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   The extra business.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.240]   It's great.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.760]   The other thing a Mac mini is great for is just having a kind of an Apple TV on steroids
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   at home.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.920]   You know, when you have something that you can-- you're using kind of like an Apple
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.880]   TV and then you just switch over and surf the web in your living room.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.120]   I thought I would ever do that.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.600]   But you could completely change the form factor at this point.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.360]   You could make it look like a Rubik's Cube if you wanted to.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   Yep.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.480]   There is one that makes-- there's a company that makes one that looks like a Rubik-- not
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   Rubik's Cube, but it's very, very-- it's a little PC.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   I can't think of the name of it right now.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   Yeah, the Nux.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   The Nux.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.040]   The new unit of computing-- these is the Intel thing there, but they're-- they look like
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.400]   they're basically Apple TV-sized.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.560]   No, no, there's another one that's a little bit bigger.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   They're pretty powerful.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.040]   I kind of like the idea of a square.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.520]   It would be kind of a cube.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   A cube, a little cube.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.680]   Well, realize that if you're going to have the same sort of expandability that you have
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.960]   on the current mall, it's got five USB ports.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   It's got HDMI.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's got-- it's got the ethernet.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.360]   It's got lightning-- multiple lightning ports, I think.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.920]   Then you're actually dealing with how much space does that have to be to actually accommodate
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.080]   on their ports?
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   Also, how much square footage does it have to have contact with the table to make sure
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.760]   that all those cables don't tip it up or pull it over?
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.280]   So I would think that they would go for flatter rather than necessarily a smaller footprint.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.600]   But you start off with thinking, how-- what can you do once you decide that this doesn't
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.040]   have to have a mechanical hard drive, which is going to be solid state only, and then
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   move on from there.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.320]   And that's how you decide how this thing's going to be designed.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.160]   I'm totally sold on something that I was very unsold on, which is a cylindrical shape
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.080]   of the Mac Pro, because it's really functional.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.560]   It's basically a blower.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   Right.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   Right.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   This is what you're talking about.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   Gigabytes, bricks.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   That's not it.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   That's not it.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   Go for a Tesseract.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   Tesseract.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   It's a pretty hyper-fist.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   This is a nux that I'm talking about already.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.880]   That's more storage on the inside than the other side.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.840]   The nux is low power.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.120]   Awamit, now the bricks is a little taller than a nux.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   It's like--
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.360]   It's like the best name ever.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.680]   I'm very tempted to get a nux.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.600]   But see, I would be really tempted to get a Mac.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.440]   I have no use for it, but if it looked like that, if it were cute like that.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   But the mini's not cheap.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   It's what?
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.440]   800 bucks now.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   It's gotten-- or 700.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   I'm not going to go anywhere.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   It's getting close to the Mac Pro as well.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   They suit them up.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.320]   This is the ones we get are like $2,000, but we've put tons of RAM in them.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   Yeah, SSDs.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.920]   All right, so FH Fightk of Maryland, USA, my answer is no.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.880]   I will not buy a Mac mini.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.680]   I'm waiting just like you.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.160]   He's holding it.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   And truthfully, to be honest, as cute as that is, I don't think Apple is looking at me to
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   see if I've bought one before.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.360]   And on Leo bought computer, never refreshes.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   That's right.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.600]   So I'll go buy computer.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.920]   One for Renee.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.840]   Why would inter-app communication be useful in iOS 8?
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.360]   Did you say something about all those lines?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.000]   I was tweeting about that earlier because everyone says they want inter-app communications
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.320]   on iOS, but everyone has a very different definition of what that is.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.360]   Some people think it means content sharing or default apps or a plugin architecture for
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   things like one password or text expander.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.520]   And for some people, it's just a dizzying array of different features.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.080]   I was just curious to see what-- when people said that they want inter-app communication,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.280]   the actual problem they wanted solved.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.920]   I know Andy's talked about just workflow and being able to move files around.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.840]   But is that inter-app communication or is that a central file repository?
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.000]   So I just wanted a little bit of-- I wanted to see where people were thinking about that.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.840]   I would love-- I have to say the one thing that I would love to see is last pass, have
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   inter-app.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   Does it make sense?
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   It makes me-- I hate to tell you.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   It's so painful though.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.960]   You're just-- they're like, I go to-- because everything in my stuff is last pass.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.040]   You go in there and all of my passwords, almost all of my hashes--
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.640]   you switch, you go over, you get the last pass password, you copy it, you pick-- I agree.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.760]   On Android, you can use a last pass keyboard.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.080]   That's how they solve that for a long time.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.000]   And we just type it in for you.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.160]   And then the newest-- and of course, they have a last pass browser.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   They do that on Apple though.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.920]   You have the last pass browser, right?
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.880]   And then the newest thing, when you go to a password, it's imperfect.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.240]   But when you sometimes-- when you go to a password field, last pass pops up and says,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.720]   oh, you want me to fill this up for you.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   That's what you want.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   That's what I want.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   And just-- you know, just--
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.880]   Android, because it's a more open system.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.920]   And as a result, less secure.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.200]   Does that allow this?
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:23.240]   When you add a new program, for instance, the share buttons on iOS are Facebook and Twitter,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.280]   because that's the deal Apple made, right?
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.480]   When you add anything on Android, now the share button has this little--
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.680]   mucher button goes on and on and on.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.760]   Because almost anything that you can share it to now has an entry in the share field.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.280]   Right.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.360]   Well, they have open in, but they don't have send to, which is the opposite of open in.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.440]   So it's a one-directional process on iOS.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   Right.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   Open in, right.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.520]   And then, yeah, there's some sort of signaling mechanism saying, I handle PDF so you can open
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.840]   in me.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   What is that called?
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.480]   I'm not off it's official name, but that's just the open in my blog.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   Open in.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.800]   Thank you, Matt and Iowa, for that question.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.360]   This is what you were talking about.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.000]   Alex Lindsey, the piston.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.520]   And if you look at this thing--
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.880]   XI3 does some really sweet computers, by the way.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.960]   These are amazing.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.600]   These are, I guess these are basically like the modern shuttle system, right?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.520]   Yeah, but if you look at that-- to note to him.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.120]   Four USB 3 ports.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.680]   One, two, three, four USB-- no, yeah, four USB--
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   You are SATA getting through the two ports.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   Four SATA ports.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.960]   I don't know what that-- oh, that's an optical audio port, ethernet, HDMI.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.520]   I think it's a display port.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.000]   Two display ports.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Holy komoly.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.840]   That's a lot of love there.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.080]   And it's-- you know, and they're--
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   That's just powerful machines.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.360]   That's just showing off.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.160]   You can't drive all that stuff.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.600]   It's just showing off.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.000]   And this is modular, so you can add stuff to it.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.520]   Actually, it says you can do HTML-- multiple displays.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.680]   Quad core-- oh, it's an AMD processor.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:07.360]   And it's got a Radeon 7660G, 8 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs SSD.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.280]   Yeah, this could be a Mac mini.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.040]   This could be a Mac-- I don't see Apple making something with that.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.360]   Oh, look, you glue it to a monitor.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   This is what you do with your Mac minis.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   Yeah, well, and that's the thing is you look at--
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.200]   we've been looking at using these for a bunch of those things.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.760]   Which-- where you can actually attach them
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.360]   to the back of the monitor with a lot of beef.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.480]   It looks like one of those aliens in half life
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.800]   that got the face huggers.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.320]   Face huggers?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.920]   Face huggers.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:39.720]   I've got your monitor.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.480]   But for a lot of streaming solutions,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.280]   we've been looking at possibly using some of these
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:43.840]   because they're--
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.200]   This is the--
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.960]   This is so tiny.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.640]   They call it the piston, the X7A from X-I3.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.520]   That's pretty cool.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.080]   You have to think about luggage a lot
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.680]   when you're looking at equipment for your company,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.840]   don't you, Alex?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   Oh, man.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.160]   If it doesn't fit in the Pelican case, he don't want it.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.680]   Well, no, there's definitely things
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.560]   that we have trouble with because they'll be just a little too
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.200]   wide or a little too high or whatever.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.240]   But definitely size does matter for us.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.480]   And small is really--
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.720]   Small and light is what we're trying to always
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.480]   try to figure out.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   Well, I think you should take a look at a piston.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   Yep.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.080]   So that actually answers the next big question
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.200]   on the question engine.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.480]   How would the Mac Mini redesign look from Simon--
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.120]   The piston.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.440]   But without the little humps.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   Like this little cube, the Simon piston.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.160]   A Rubik's cube.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.400]   It would be awesome.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   That would go crazy.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.520]   That's all I got to say.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.720]   When we come back more with our big, big group
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.920]   of wonderful panelists, we've got Alex Lindsey in studio.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.080]   Renee Richie from iMore.com, Andy Ennaco from the Chicago
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.120]   Sun Times.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.960]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.920]   but a new product from Shutterstock,
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.200]   I want to tell you about called Offset.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.600]   If you go to offset.com/welcome/macbreak,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.200]   you can find out all about it.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.240]   The idea is--
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.840]   we got a gift for you too, by the way, if you go there.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.360]   The idea is it's a--
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.640]   Shutterstock is known for its royalty-free images.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.160]   But how would you like really high quality images,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.640]   high-end photos and illustrations
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.160]   from the world's top editorial and commercial artists?
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.240]   Now we're talking Offset.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.160]   This is a new brand from Shutterstock.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.520]   Gorgeous, gorgeous imagery.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.280]   As photographers, we really appreciate what Offset is doing.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.600]   Just really gorgeous stuff.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.000]   High quality images from the top editorial photographers
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.720]   and illustrators around the world,
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.840]   talent featured in magazines like Conde Nast, Traveler,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.080]   and National Geographic, National Advertising campaigns.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.200]   Every single image, of course, reviewed
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.000]   for artistic distinction, a narrative quality
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.400]   by Offset's professional team of photo editors.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.520]   As much as important as photography
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.840]   is, the photo editor is really a key.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.040]   The guy who says this one, not that one, is so key to this.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.880]   So these tend to be editorial shots.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.160]   Look at these.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.200]   Just gorgeous.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.960]   Or designs too.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   They're not pose shots.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   They're real-life moments, in many cases.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.160]   Each image has two price points, $250 for the image size
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.520]   suitable for the web.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.640]   You want high resolution of print $500.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.360]   Every image is royalty-free.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.600]   Terms are simple and generous.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.720]   You get rights-managed quality.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.080]   Professional experience, award-winning photographers
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.200]   and illustrators.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.680]   Gorgeous stuff.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.560]   I'll give you an example.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.440]   Dave Du Chamere, or Chamere, I'm not sure.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.320]   These are the kind of guys we used to have on Twitter photo,
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.160]   and I just loved having them on.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.880]   He is a humanitarian assignment photographer.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.400]   He's a wrestling author, you know him?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.480]   I have met him in passing, but I've seen a lot of his work.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.360]   He's from Vancouver.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.880]   But he's got images on all seven continents.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.800]   Powerful images.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.720]   While creating art, he is also creating editorial images
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.760]   that are just going to be gorgeous.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.080]   I would buy these and print them, to be honest,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   and hang them on the wall.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.160]   Explore Offset today.

[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.320]   Wow.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.120]   I think I'm going to do that.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.240]   I'm going to go through these for printing and putting up on the wall.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.400]   I mean, this is gorgeous stuff.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:33.080]   Offset.com/welcome/macbreak.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.040]   Take a look.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   Gorgeous stuff.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.280]   Continuing on with Macbreak Weekly.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   We could take some more questions from the engine in a bit,
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.840]   but if you haven't--
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.680]   and this is only useful if you're watching live.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   It is bit.ly/404MBW.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.680]   Correct.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   And you can pose your questions there.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   But there's an important function you can have there,
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   even if you're not posing questions, you vote them up.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   And we take the most up-voted questions.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   We don't even look at questions that are down-voted.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   So that's how we moderate it.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   In effect, you moderate it for us.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   After just a programming note, we will cover the keynote live.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Mike Elgin and I, Alex Lindsay,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   will be here covering the keynote live 10 AM Pacific on Monday.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   That is 1 PM Eastern Time 1700 UTC.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   I don't think they're streaming it.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   Here they are.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   They are.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   Yes.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   I love you, Apple.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   So nice.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   And for developers, they're streaming state of the union
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   and the ADA awards.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   But you have to be signed in and have a developer account.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Yeah, but for the main keynote is free for everybody.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   Yeah, so we won't be able to rebroadcast the others,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   but we'll do the keynote.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   And we'll do our usual Mystery Science Theater 3000 thing
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   where we'll sit in front of the screen.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   If you want to watch the keynote without our Blather,
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   you can absolutely encourage you to do that.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   But if you want to get commentary on top of it,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   sometimes snark, even mostly not.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   [laughter]
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   We could--
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   Piffy.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   I will say it's harder now because I think the presentations
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   I've gotten more-- they've gotten more piffy.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.680]   They're a little bit more efficient.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   So there's less time in between for us to sit there and chat.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   Because I think in the old ones, I think it was just--
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   there was a lot of stuff that I was interested in.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   A lot of sitting through a demonstration of now how you play things in iTunes.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   Or how successful we've been, and this is how many we sold.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   You know they're going to do that.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   They always start.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   The Steve Jobs set the template.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   And his first 10 minutes are, "Our stores are doing wonderfully."
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   Now that we have all of your attention,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.680]   we'd like to say these things and bore you to death.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   I want to find keynote bingo for 2014.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   For some years, they had app demo after app demo.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   Like 45 minutes of one app.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   And they bring in partners to do it.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   Electronic R, that was boring.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   I agree.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.680]   Stop with the partners.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   I don't see any-- nobody has yet to do bingo for this year's--
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   well, there's an app.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   There's an Apple bingo app.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   I don't think this is--
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   It is interesting how long this keynote is scheduled to go on.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   That's definitely--
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   Two hours, right?
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   It's definitely a WWDC style keynote.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   So they are not going to be showing, I think, like 20 different things.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   I think they're going-- they've got two or three really big things to show off.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   So if there's a new-- for instance, if they do show off iOS 8 or Mac OS 10.11,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   that's going to be just a long 45 minutes of yours.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   Here's-- let me walk you through this brand new interface we've put together.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   Here are why we've made these design choices.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   Here's how great this looks.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   And here's how fast this operates.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   This is-- a lot-- it's going to be a long time of how long it's going to go.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   It's going to be a long time of having to make the case of why they're making a big change
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   rather than walking us through.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   And we've also have a new version of iPhoto.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.680]   We've made the buttons a little bit more squared.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   Now you can look at the buttons that are more squared.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.680]   I think that they got a lot to disseminate.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   And a lot of this-- I mean, while they are streaming it, they're going to talk to me.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   We have to remember that the purpose of this is to show developers what they should be developing towards.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   So, you know, that's the thought process anyway.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   Like, here's new hardware that you're going to get to develop for.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   This is new software, new infrastructure issues, so on and so forth.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   I think that is the context for this as opposed to a iLife launch or something else.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   And the-- I mean, OS 10, 10.10 is getting a lot of buzz, especially for developers.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   It's supposed to be--
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   What's going to be different in 10.10?
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   Superficially the redesign, but a lot of people are hearing that Apple's making changes
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   that will be very, very interesting for developers as well.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   Mm. This is the-- this is normally would be the minor update.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   It's so hard to tell now because--
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   Snow Maverick.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   Yeah, I don't think that's operative anymore.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   I think that Apple is really in a position of getting themselves ready, as I said,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   for the next five years, for the next 10 years.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   All I can say is that I really think that if you are a developer with a really important product,
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   enjoy that.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   Be with your family, be with your children before Monday because--
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   This is a Monday.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   It's over.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   Life gets a lot more different.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   It's a lot more like iOS 11 than a OS 10.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   So, I mean, to put it in context is there was a lot of stuff that when Johnny Ive and when
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   Craig Fageriki were sort of unified in Tim Cook's new management structure that they wanted to do,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   but it's physically impossible for that team to work any harder than they do.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   I mean, they worked at the point of exhaustion and they had to get iOS 7 done last year,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   so they couldn't do OS 10 at the same time.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   And now they've had a year to refine iOS 8, but they've also had a year to sort of get
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   OS 10 to wear their visions, want it to be, and that's had a lot of significance.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   There has been significant amount of negativity over Mavericks.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   I don't mind Mavericks.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   I like it.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.680]   I haven't had big problems with it, but a lot of people have.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   I don't mind Madrix.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   You like it?
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   I just don't have it on it.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   You can put it on that.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   Okay, well, that's my question because you're slow to put this stuff on your production.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   I mean, we've seen some issues with some of the-- with the one or two computers that we added.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   1093 has been apparently with Final Cut.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   So we've been very slow.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   The problem is we can't upgrade to some stuff because of that.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   Right.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   So we'll slowly move forward.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   We've decided to kind of wait until what app-- see what Apple talks about here.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   We're kind of skipping the initial Mavericks.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.680]   It's a long, interesting.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   So--
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   I still have one important computer that's not running Mavericks yet.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   And it's not because I'm holding off because of any specific reason.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   I think it really is just because there's nothing specifically in Mavericks that says,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   "Oh, my God.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   I really got to upgrade that last machine to make sure that this can do that wonderful thing
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.680]   that all my other computers can do."
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   Right.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   I'll be-- this is for an older computer that's about two or three years old.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   But it just goes to show you.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   I think that we're all kind of hot for a new version of the Mac that says, "I'd be a fool
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   to wait any longer than I have to to get access to this sort of speed, this sort of convenience,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.680]   and this sort of easy use."
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   So--
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   Exciting.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   Syrah, S-Y-R-A-H is the code name.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   When will 10, 10 be out, you think?
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   Later this year?
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   Yes, usually--
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   If they found the same template, yeah.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   The C to developers next week and then general release end of August early September.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   So--
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   Or they could once again promise this year sometime and then take until December.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   There's no 10, 10 out now.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   There's no seed program.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   No beta.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   No beta.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.080]   Now that Apple is really hammering code names or product names rather than numbers, I honestly
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.680]   have to do a get info to remind myself what number I am on right now.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   Yeah, I'm on 10, I think Mavericks first.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   I don't think 10.9 first.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   Sorry if I said 10.11.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   I don't think that Apple's going to be showing off 10.11 next week.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   If the API changes are significant, developers will need time to get used to them and to implement
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   them.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   I like Nylash and our chatroom who said Yosemite celebrating its 150th anniversary this year
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   OS 10 Yosemite would be quite a good name.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   I think it would be an excellent name.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   But we don't have a name yet.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   Wasn't there a--
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   Wasn't that a code name for one of the Macs?
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   Yosemite?
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   Yeah, the Yosemite--
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   I think it was one of the Mac Pros or something was it, or maybe a chip or something like that.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   10, 10, a free upgrade?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   Yes.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   That's the pattern now.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   That's what they've said going forward.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   Continue to be free.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Later this year, perhaps if they're on schedule although no-- and no one's seen any bits.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   So there are no leaks about what 10, 10 might be.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   You said a new design, Renee.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   What is that?
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   So again, Johnny I was taken over as head of design.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   Previously, Scott Forestall's team, the human interface team, Steve Jobs, they all had opinions
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   on what the design should look like.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   Johnny I have now is head of design for the entire company.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   He has very strong opinions of what design should look like.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   iOS 7 reflects what that is in mobile and will get a chance to see what that looks like in terms of
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   desktop computing soon.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   And one of the things to members, Apple spent a really long time making the Mac not work like iOS,
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   but look like iOS.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   So all those iOS users could be more comfortable if they then wanted to have the halo effect
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   and go to where does the Mac.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   And iOS 7 changed that fundamentally.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   Everything looks totally different now.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   So getting a little bit of that familiarity back would probably be beneficial for them.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:08.680]   I think overall, not so much making the Mac look more like iOS so much as to look like Mac OS
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   and iOS are both products of the same shop, which is not something they have right now.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   And if you look at the dock right now, I'm looking at it right now.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   And there's practically it really is a laundry list of everything that wanted to get rid of
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   pre iOS 7, where you've got it's three dimensional.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   You've got shadows.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   Every icon is like a little photograph, like a little piece of artwork as opposed to a little piece of graphic design.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   So obviously the things that we want to immediately start guessing about our flattened interface,
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   more icons that are circles, maybe a change to the system font to make it a little bit more retina friendly.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.680]   Even though it's interesting to take these guesses though, because when you look at, in retrospect,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:55.680]   every single design choice, I think that Apple made for iOS 7 was there to reflect the fact that
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   every single iOS device practically is now a retina grade display.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   And now you no longer need drop shadows.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   You no longer need thick fonts with anti-aliased text because you don't have to fake a real
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   display.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   You now have a really good display.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:14.680]   So I think it's going to be interesting to see the choices that Apple makes given that they can't now make a
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   redesign that is just for the Retina MacBook Pro, or even a future retina MacBook Air.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   They have to be okay with the idea of someone having a Mac mini that's connected to a Samsung monitor
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   or someone who has a MacBook Air 13 inch or a MacBook Air 11 inch that doesn't have a retina display yet.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   So there's going to be a lot of interesting choices to be made there.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   But one last thing though is that I think that maybe we're jumping the gun by always talking about
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   Johnny Ive and his influence and his thoughts and his imperatives.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   The more I talk to people, the more I have to remind myself that Apple really is a team effort,
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   even when we're designed as concerned.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   They don't necessarily, it's one person or even one small group of people who are calling shots for everybody.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   I really think that everybody at every level is on the same page.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   That's why I refer to it as a house design sort of as opposed to having separate products
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.680]   that have separate interfaces and looks like they might have been made by two different companies.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   What else? Well, we'll see iOS 8. We know a little bit about that because that has been kind of leaking out,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   including health book.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   I'm thinking maybe, maybe, what's the world going to say with when we get to the end of the day on Monday?
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   By the way, we'll do our Mac break weekly on Monday this week instead of next week instead of Tuesday.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.680]   Right after the keynote, Andy's going to be in town.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   We're going to be in town. They're going to whip up here.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.680]   You'll be here Alex Lindsey.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.680]   We'll do a special Mac break weekly right after our coverage.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   What if he says nothing about an eye watch? Nothing about Apple TV. Nothing about the Mac mini.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   Are people going to be frustrated?
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   I think that if there's enough improvements with iOS 8 and with the new OS and a lot of other services,
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.680]   but I think they're going to talk about hardware.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.680]   I mean, there's got to be some hardware that's coming out.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   We've heard new Mac books, maybe new MacBook Airs. Is that what you think?
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   It's hard. I mean, first of all, with an eye watch, Apple has never announced a new product category at WWDC.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.680]   It's a developers conference. The iPhone is produced at Macworld.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.680]   The iPad is introduced at a special event.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.680]   Yeah, but this is the only scheduled event Apple does all years.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   Well, they'll have it on the schedule.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   But I think that the only thing about the reason, the argument for both home automation and the eye watch,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:38.680]   if they did it and possibly opening up Apple TV, would be obviously telling developers that this is something
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   that you should be building apps for.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   So I'm giving you the chance though to say, no, and you just did, I guess.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.680]   No, don't expect much about these products because this is not where you would announce them.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.680]   Yeah, and as you said, maybe an AP. I think that this is, they're always famously,
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   they release their schedule of classroom things at WWDC.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   They're always those, like sort of to be announced later sort of slots.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.680]   I think that this is, if they don't announce, I don't think they're going to announce a larger screen iPhone,
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   but I think this is going to be the one in which they absolutely want to make sure that everybody who came to this conference,
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.680]   it was an iOS developer, left this conference understanding how to create a screen size independent iOS app.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   And who understands that if you do not, that after a certain, there's going to be a point at which you can submit an app to the app store,
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:32.680]   that is not screen size independent, that will be either summarily rejected or will be forced to look like crap on future devices.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   And I think that's the big deal that's going to be coming up.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   And then they might play CU in September at the end of the conference.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   Right.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   And the other thing that's important to remember is things like a retina MacBook Air, if that's built on the Broadwell platform,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   Intel has delayed the Broadwell platform, and that probably makes it difficult to slot in products that you might have wished came out round about now,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   or now subject to that.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   Apple is with the Mac, they are very bounty Intel's roadmap.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   It's a good slot to do a simple refresh to the Mac Mini.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   Again, a performance upgrade, as opposed to a redesign.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   You've got two hours to fill.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   You're going to need to have some breaks between the 45 minutes of slides that are packed with new phrases,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   of which they only point out three, of which we're frantically screenshotting to make sure we can look up these things later on.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   So if you want to make a wager, it's a good idea to look at second tier products that haven't had a refresh in a while and say,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   "Okay, this is a good time to spend 10 minutes on two slides that explain how they've updated these things."
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.680]   I'm not sure we're going to see anything hard, we're in terms of watch-wise or wearable-wise.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   You know who we might see as Angela Arrence?
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   I think it'd be great if Tim Cook says to tell you about how well we're doing in our Apple stores and Apple retail,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   here's Angela Arrence, our newest.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   Yeah, she has great presence on...
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   She's done a lot of Salesforce events, which we've done a lot of.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   Really?
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   Nice English accent.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   She's American.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   She's American, yeah, but she has a great presence on stage, so she definitely has been a woman presenting on stage for a long time.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   If ever.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   There have been engineers presenting, but not engineers.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   Yeah, engineer demos that I remember, but I can't think of any excitement.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   I think this would be a good time to get a well-spoken woman up there and say, "Look, here's our newest.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   I'd love to see Johnny get on stage, he never will.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   He did at the Mac when they announced the Unibody MacBook Air.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   He got up on stage and passed around the body now, but he does it very rarely.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   Apple's new ads have gotten even more iffy.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   I have to say, Apple really seems to be aiming at the high end.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   They feature Essa Pekka Saladin, who is, according to Apple, a renowned composer and conductor.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   I guess I'm just a ignorant, I guess, of the high end modern news and scenes.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   But he uses an iPad Air to engage a contemporary audience.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   He created the orchestra app to share his love of classical music.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.680]   This is really interesting.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   What is your verse?
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   What is your verse?
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   That is really already kind of a high end thing.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   This isn't the ad, actually.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   This is a video on the site.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.680]   They have one of those super sites all around it.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   He's a conductor as well as a composer.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   He uses apparently the iPad Air.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   It's really interesting how...
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   The ad was really showing him composing music on an iPad or arranging it.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   Then suddenly it shows up preparing it all and then putting it out on...
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   Let me find the ad.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   Which I thought was a pretty...
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   Very, very interesting.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   All the more verse ads are very heavy.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   They're very different than the gigantic ads for iPhone, for example.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   They don't seem to be aimed at a normal person.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   They demand you live a better life, Leo.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   Is this appealing to people?
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   Look, you could be a world-class composer and travel writer and choreographer.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   It's pretty clear.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   Everybody wants to think of themselves as an artist, as a creative person, as an inventor,
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   as a maker.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   I think that's your problem.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   You're using a Dell.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   Here's the ad.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   S. Peccas verse.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:57.680]   S. Peccas Solomon.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   I guess it's a compel.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   I thought it was really interesting.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:17.680]   It's interesting.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.680]   This is not a Mac Pro ad, is it?
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.680]   Right.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   It's an iPad Air ad.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   And by the way, he's not wearing Beats headphones.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   He's wearing those white headphones.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   Your verse is all iPad Air.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   That's the whole idea of your verse.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   There are other ads.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   I don't know if you remember the iPad 2 commercial technology, like we believe technology alone
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   is not enough.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   This is the linear success.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   It is, isn't it?
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   And I think it's a great ad.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   I mean, do they only show it on PBS?
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   Well, but I think that--
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   By the way, no words in that entire ad.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   So if those of you listening at home, you didn't miss anything.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   It's just international.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   International.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   Well, I think that one of the things that distinguishes the iPad, I think, and more from the applications,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.680]   not from the capability, but there are more applications that allow you to do, I think,
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   some of the really deep creation tools.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:11.200]   You know, some of those, I think, are better than the stuff I've seen on Android, as far
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.680]   as the interface, as far as the process is, what distinguishes it as a creation tool,
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   not just a consumption tool.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   I think that I think a lot of people look at the iPad as a consumption tool, but I think
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.680]   they really want to keep it moving towards this is a creation tool.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.680]   This is something I think--
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   It's a very good option for people to have a very good idea of how to use a machine.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   And the iPhone, you would maybe could argue that's not a creation tool.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   Really are about creation.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.680]   In this case, again, music.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   Well, I use my iPhone, iPod touches, and tablets as tools, far more than I use them for anything
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   else, whether it's phone, or communication, or surfing, or whatever.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   There are specific tools within our pipeline.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   Boy, I mean, when Steve Jobs said, "Peace on people are going to need a truck."
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   Apparently, the truck is now the iPad Air.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.680]   It's not a Macintosh ad in a long time.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   I mean, this is where the money is made.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.680]   Right.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.680]   And in a way, they're saying, "Look, you can compose music on an air.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.680]   You don't need a MacBook."
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   This actually is more than just music.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   Now they're showing a father making a video.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   I really like this ad.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.680]   At first, I thought, "Ah, but I've come to like this ad."
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   And again, international, there's no words.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   There's the one that they don't own anymore.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.680]   That's WordLens.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   That's all the Google.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.680]   Especially when you compare this to that tone deaf by comparison Intel tablet ad that's
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   been running, where here you have an ad in which you see 2,000 people using hundreds, a dozen different
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.680]   apps, all of them beautiful to do a variety of really impressive things.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   The Intel tablet ad has one guy, essentially, it's hard to tell whether this tablet's doing
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   anything but simply playing a pre-recorded beats track.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   He's some sort of street musician.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   And if you look him up, he's on Twitter.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.680]   He has 40 followers.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.680]   And you can see some...
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   No, I'm being absolutely true.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   Absolutely honest here.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   I looked up the name and he is a street musician.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:13.680]   You can see a couple of interviews with him, of him talking about being...
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   I think he's actually said he was impressed by Richard Stalman, which is kind of a...
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Oh, this guy?
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   This is the...
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.680]   Oh, I actually know that guy.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.680]   He's in San Francisco all the time.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   He's amazing, by the way.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.680]   Like, whether he's...
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   It's just...
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   But these guys are actual street performers, though.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   That's the problem.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   You're seeing all he's doing is sort of dancing around with a tablet in his hand.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   You see all these...
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   It's got a problem because Intel doesn't make it tablet.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   So these are generic...
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.680]   These have to be very generic kind of things.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.680]   They're chips on you.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.680]   He can't...
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.680]   He could have been holding a clipboard from Staples.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   It doesn't leave you thinking, "My goodness.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.680]   I like the cut of that Intel chips jib.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.680]   I want to look into this."
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   I don't think you don't get a sense of what he's actually doing with the tablet.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.680]   I think that's the problem.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   He's dancing around with it and he's...
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   Whether he's affected the music or not.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   He's playing it, I mean.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   Yeah, he's...
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   One access is rhythm.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.680]   One access is scale, according to the article that I read.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   Because I was actually thinking, "Oh, my God.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   He is totally going to break that part section of the motherboard that that headphone jack has plugged into."
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   That heavy cable plugged into it.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   It reminds me that early motor...
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.680]   The early Motorola Verizon commercials for tablets when the iPad first came out.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.680]   An iPad...
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.680]   iPad 2 came out and they had that technology alone.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   It's not enough commercial.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   And right after that, they had the Motorola one where it said, "How do I get my wife to let me buy this?"
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.680]   And the guy said, "You tell her it's got a quad-core processor."
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   It just doesn't...
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   It doesn't tell the story of the device.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   Let's go back to the question engine in just a second.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   Get your questions in at bit.ly/404MBW.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.680]   That's it, 404-MBW.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.680]   And we'll take the top...
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.680]   The top questions.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   So, vote them up.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   If you don't have a question, go there.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   You don't have to have a question.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:01.680]   It's the bit.ly/404MBW.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.680]   And just vote on stuff so that we know what you want to hear.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.680]   And then we'll go from there.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at hovered.com.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   I just registered a whole bunch of domain names at hovered.com.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   It's the domain registrar of choice that I use.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   I'm a fan.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.680]   It's a great way not only to get your domains registered quickly and easily, but then once
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.680]   you have the domains, to completely manage them, it's very simple.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   They don't upsell you because they don't sell hosting.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   They make it easy.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:36.680]   And in fact, what they do is they build in all the stuff that you would normally want.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.680]   You don't have to click 50 times to get who is privacy, for instance.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   That's built in.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   They've got great telephone support.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.680]   You can register a domain for you or for your business.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.680]   Add email to any of your domains.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   They make it very easy to transfer your domains.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   I moved all my domains over to hovered.com.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   And their concierge service did it.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   Actually, I did it myself, which is stupid.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   Use the concierge service.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   You'll save yourself a lot of time.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   Advanced DNS management, bulk management tools.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   If you have a lot of domain names, that's really nice.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   When you're looking for the best place to register a domain name,
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   just ask the geeks.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.680]   They'll tell you programmers, designers, developers all love Hover.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   But you don't have to be an expert to get a domain.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   It's so simple to use.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   And right now, there's a new top level domain that I really like.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.680]   You'll see it at the very top of the Hover page.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.680]   .club.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.680]   The new .club.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:41.680]   If you're in the Muncie Rotary Club,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   get the Muncie Rotary.club.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.680]   And that could be your new domain.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.680]   Great for any social club, country club, your book club,
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   sortin' laser.club.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   .club.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   Or like wooden.club.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680]   Wooden.club.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   Hit me with your big club.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   They're searchable.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   They're treated the same way in Google search results.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   And because they're brand new, you have a much better chance of getting your name.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   You don't have to have those dashes or the real to it.club.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   Nice TLD.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680]   This is a new one from Hover.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   But they've got 'em all.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   Visit Hover.com.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   Use our promo code MBW5.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   MBW in the number five.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.680]   And you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.680]   When it comes time, when you're thinking, "I need a new domain name."
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   Get one in Hover.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   I just bought like 50.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.680]   Hover.com.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.680]   Well, 'cause I like to, like, just in case,
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   I like to get the, you know, when there's a new TLD, I like to get all the variations.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   Just in case I want 'em.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]   I might, yeah, I mean, they're so affordable.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.680]   It's very easy to do.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   Hover.com.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   Use the Africa to MBW5.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   Back to the Kveschen engine.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   This is an interesting one.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:03.680]   And in fact, exactly something we were gonna talk about next, which is this big issue in Australia.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.680]   Now, I don't think this is something that's gonna hit most of you, 'cause you're smart.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680]   Right.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   But apparently people are getting hijacked and ransomed using, I gather, find my iPhone on iCloud.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   There, and let me go to this story from the age.au.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   'Cause I think they have an image.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   It says, "Oleg Pliss has hacked your device."
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.680]   Right.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   Damn him.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.680]   It doesn't really seem like they want any money, 'cause the email address that's given isn't real.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   You can't actually...
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.680]   Apparently, he's a well-known researcher who's probably not involved in this course.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680]   Yeah, he's at Oracle.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Yeah, the whole thing is kind of stupid.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680]   It's Australia only.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   It's, they're only hacking, find my iPhone when your Apple ID would give them access to a lot more things.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   They're asking for variable, but very low sums of money.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   The whole thing is incredibly...
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   It's like kids stealing a particle and a joyride sort of stuff.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.680]   It's kind of, yeah, it's kind of silly vandalism.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.680]   It's not an issue if you have a passcode on your iPhone.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.680]   Won't affect it.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   If you have a good password on your iCloud account, you probably won't get affected.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   I would like to say, if you don't have a passcode on your iPhone, what are you thinking?
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.680]   Yeah, like I say.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   The PayPal account they're using, Lock 404 at Hotmail.com, is not real.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.680]   So they're not actually asking for money.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.680]   This is a kid, some kid.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.680]   There's a theory that they hacked something else and people who are using the same password
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   for find my iPhone that they use on whatever was hacked are the people who are using it.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   Ah, yeah, and this is a really big no-no that'll... Oh, everybody does.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   I used to do it, which is...
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   You don't want to remember a bunch of passwords, so you use one password everywhere.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   You should use one password or...
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680]   Last password.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.680]   Not a single password on all your accounts.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680]   Because you know...
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   You know, what's strong, unique...
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   What if you use your eBay password everywhere?
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.680]   And now, of course, eBay's been hacked and you've got to change your password everywhere.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.680]   So...
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   And the real problem is that they can try it.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.680]   And they can say, "Oh, look, let's see if it works on Twitter.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   Let's see if it works on Facebook.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   Let's see if it works on iCloud."
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.680]   Right.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.680]   Now, they said two-factor authentication can be enabled.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.680]   Yes.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   In certain...
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.680]   In many countries, Apple has two-factor authentication.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680]   Okay.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680]   Not my country?
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.680]   Yes.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680]   The US, Canada, Australia.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680]   Okay.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.680]   About 12 countries, I think, now.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.280]   So you go to your Apple ID, you select "Manage your Apple ID," you sign in, you select the
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.680]   password and security tab, and then you can...
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.400]   You know, I can't remember my secret questions.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   That's probably part of the thing.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400]   That's the thing.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.680]   If you have a password manager, like one password or the last password, don't put in real secret
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.680]   questions because it's easy to socially engineer those.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.680]   Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.400]   Put in characters or words or something and then store those in your password manager as
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   well.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   I wish they would just stop using secret questions.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.680]   It's such a terrible security flaw.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.640]   Fortunately, I can reset my security info by sending myself an email.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   So I'll do that.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   And how does...
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   I haven't used a second factor.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.880]   I'm a big second factor fan.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.560]   That sounds like a good idea.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   How does that work?
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   You use...
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   Can you use Google Authenticator?
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   What are you going to use on that?
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   I don't know if they support Google Authenticator, but I believe it's a...
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.560]   They'll send a text message?
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.560]   Okay.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560]   That's not so bad, is it?
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.320]   That's one of those things that, again, like it's a security story, so it's being widely
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.680]   misreported and often only the sensational parts of it are being reported.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.760]   But for me, it's a cautionary tale that you want strong, unique passwords in as many places
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.600]   as you can and you want to follow.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.080]   All the stuff Steve Gibson talks about routinely on site.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.160]   And I've really moved.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.880]   Once I got really comfortable with things like LastPass and so on and so forth, I've really
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.040]   gotten into the business where I'm just using hashes for almost everything.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   Just 20 character hashes.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.640]   I use the longest, randomest password.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.160]   The site will allow me to, the sad thing is many sites won't allow you good long.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.080]   A lot of them say, "Oh, can you special characters?"
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.800]   Or "Oh, it can only be 12 letters."
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.400]   It's just really annoying.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   It really highlights that problem.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   Nevertheless, yeah.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   But even then, if you...
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.360]   In the last class, one password...
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.680]   And you're just pleased to get a password vault.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.560]   And the key is, and by the way, when you use those, the one thing that I have a lot of
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.040]   different computers that I work on is you just know that you can set a...
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.120]   There's a setting that says, "When I log into a new computer, unlock me out from everything
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120]   else."
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.280]   And so that you're constantly making sure that you only have one...
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.400]   Because using something like one password or last password with great power comes great
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   responsibility.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.520]   Leaving that open or not having a really good password for that really puts you in a position
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.720]   of a serious problem.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.280]   So definitely keep your security up really high on those.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.880]   But make sure that all your passwords, I mean all my passwords...
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.360]   And I wasn't always this way, but all of my passwords are almost all over hashes except
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.280]   for ones that I know that I'll have to log into on a web page without LastPass.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.760]   And even those are complicated.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.120]   And then the main thing is they're all different.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.040]   This problem that you're seeing is people using the same password most likely.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040]   We think.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.560]   But it's a very common hacking solution is for...
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.960]   I get one password and I'll test it on all the other things to see if I can get a hold
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   of it.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.400]   And so having an individual password for everything that you do is very important.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.160]   Someone asked what a hash is.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.160]   A hash is just a crazy number of characters.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.760]   Or whatever, just random characters.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.440]   Hash is like random characters.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:30.840]   It's not Memphis or whatever you might use for that.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.800]   So thank you Mr. Magpie for your question.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.840]   I am going to click it done.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   Excellent.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840]   Done.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.480]   We're moving on to our next question.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.440]   Will this comes from Mark Bernay, Costa Mesa, California.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.080]   Will Apple ever improve series voice recognition and speech synthesis?
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.160]   So is as good as Google's.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.560]   I think many people think it's as good as Google's.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.760]   I don't accept your premise, my friend.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760]   I think it's close.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.240]   Google is on device parsing.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.760]   Google has, especially on the Moto X, they have the co-processors that just do natural
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.640]   language and just do context awareness.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.440]   And that lets them do a lot of stuff locally.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.920]   And also Google hired the co-founder of what's that company called?
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.600]   A nuance who has tons of patents in the area and nuance is very good about enforcing their
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600]   patents.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.160]   So Apple has trouble when there's network problems because they can't get to Siri to
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160]   parse it.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.360]   It would be nice if they moved that on device.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.240]   Also Apple's not willing to take your data and do big data analysis and things with it
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   in the cloud.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.440]   So they can't offer the features or they choose not to offer the features that Google
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   now does.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.240]   So given those limitations, they do a pretty good job, but there's still areas they could
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   go into.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.040]   I think serious dictation is actually pretty good, but you're right.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.200]   This is the big frustration is you talk for 15 minutes and then it says, "Siri, I can't
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200]   get on the internet."
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   It's like, "Oh, my God."
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.160]   "I need to just record this, but you need nothing."
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.160]   - Yeah.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   - It's also interesting.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   - Go ahead.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.680]   - Google now is actually now getting more conversational.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.920]   My biggest frustration with it used to be that you would have to remember to say, "Set
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:04.520]   an appointment for next Tuesday at 2.30pm at this place with this note here."
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.800]   And if you screw up any of it, you then have to pick up the phone and start typing and
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   then you have to put things in.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.560]   Now it'll actually ask you, "Do Siri like, 'Okay, well, where do I do this?
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.560]   And is this okay?
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   Do you want me to send this now?
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.760]   And what phone number do you want me to text this to?"
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   - Yeah.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.840]   - I will say though that I think that Siri's voice is more pleasant than the Android voice,
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   at least the stuff one.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.280]   - I do love Google now.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.320]   I have to say I'm totally hooked on it.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.240]   - What I'd really like to see is spotlight access to Siri Engine because there's some
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.240]   situations where it's just not polite or that you just are not capable of talking to your
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   phone.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   - Right.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.600]   - And if I could just type some stuff into Spotlight and that would go off to Siri's engine and
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.840]   do the same kind of, almost like, you know, quick silver or alpha or whatever, do the
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.520]   same sort of actions and commands, I think that'd be great.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   - I like that.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   - Yeah.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.320]   - I underscore Siri as a different type of application interface, not just of, sort of
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.760]   voice commands or personal assistant.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.320]   - I didn't watch the Today Show this morning.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.240]   Was it this morning that Hoda's password was hacked in 20 seconds by a security expert.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240]   - Oops.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.240]   - And then Hoda says, "I use the same password on all my accounts."
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.840]   And he says, "Good, now you're going to change that."
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.680]   - I think he just turned the phone over and read the post that note that she had left
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   on the back of all her passwords.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.160]   - She has hacked your password in 20 seconds.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.160]   Give me a break.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.160]   Want to set up.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   - Oh, you can get it.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   - Oh, you can get it.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160]   - It's a really terrible password.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.960]   You say, "Hoda, what's your birthday?
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   What's your child's name?"
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.800]   Okay, let me try that.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   That's all the time you have.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.800]   - Types in the word password.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.240]   - But it works for so many accounts.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   It's amazing.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.080]   - It's like I have actually done a cold case like that on a couple of different people over
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.200]   the past five years, just because they think that I've got some sort of magic security
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.240]   bypass code that I, because I know that about iOS, and all I did was just on my phone, looked
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.760]   up 100 most common passwords and tried them all.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   - Try them all.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   - So get it by number 27.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.240]   - Wow, that's depressing.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   - Yeah.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.640]   - Commander Cody in Oakland, California, Smooc, Smooc, Smooc, that cigarette.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.040]   Will Apple ever release a new Thunderbolt display?
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.240]   The current line is long in the tooth and many of us have been waiting for years for one
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.280]   with a new form factor that looks a little more like the iMac.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.920]   Why such a long time between hardware refreshers?
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.240]   I think this might be time for Apple to release a 4K display.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.240]   That 4K support in 1093 is very good.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.960]   That might indicate that there's something in the works.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.120]   I have an LED cinema display, a Thunderbolt cinema display, and then a Thunderbolt 4K display.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.880]   So they have like all the generations and they look good.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.280]   You know, the big problem is the bezel.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.120]   I would love to get that bezel sized out.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.920]   - I could definitely see Apple going with a very thin bezel, you know, for something
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.880]   like that 4K, possibly very large, you know, I think.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   - My 31 1/2 inches, 2500 bucks, that's the one Apple's selling in the store to the Sharp.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   - Right.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.280]   - It's an IGZO display.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.880]   The color accuracy seems as everybody's as good as Apple's displays.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.480]   - But I think this is a great safe place.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.840]   Again, I said this on a show in the past, but I think it's a great safe place for Apple
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:51.640]   to put Apple TV circuitry into it and have this as the first like see if people not only
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.320]   buy it as a monitor but buy it as their TV.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.080]   - Yeah, the only question for me still is whether traditionally they've put the new
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.560]   panels in the iMac first and then when they had supply, you know, when that was supply
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.200]   balanced, they put it in the display.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.320]   But now they've got this Mac pro sitting out there.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.520]   So could that tilt things in the favor of putting out a 4K display?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   - 4K still are really expensive.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   - Well, wait a minute.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.320]   Now Samsung has a sub $1000, 60 Hertz 4K display.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.640]   I don't know how good it is.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.880]   - Does 4K make sense for an iMac?
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.120]   Like are they assuming that everybody who's buying iMacs now would want 4K to sell in
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   there?
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.520]   - This might be the exception.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.720]   - It requires pretty heavy duty GPU.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720]   - Yeah.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.440]   - It's not something you just want to.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.720]   - But I think that I think that it's there's a lot of pent up demand for a 4K monitor because
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.600]   of all these people buying Mac pros and well, they're losing money to Asus and Sharp.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.080]   That's what's happening.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.320]   And by the way, I can highly I recommended it last week.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.960]   I can highly recommend that Asus PQ three two one.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   What a great monitor.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   - Right.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.720]   All that 4K money on the table.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   - $2500.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.720]   But you know, maybe there's no margin in it.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   I don't know.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.920]   - Also the app logo, the margin goes up.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.960]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960]   That's worth $500.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.960]   - It's very, very expensive.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.840]   The adhesive that puts that logo is made.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.600]   They're told for us they have to tear apart to find the one insect whose chittiness body
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.200]   glue can be used to fix an apple logo to something.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.360]   - I couldn't be happier with that monitor and with that setup, especially because high
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.760]   DPI is here.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   So it's ready.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   - It's a nice handling.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   - I have a 31 inch right now.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760]   Look at that.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.800]   - Thank you, Commander Cody.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.280]   Should we do a couple more?
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   - Yeah.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   - This is fun.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.560]   I love the question engine.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.320]   Sarah Lane, that's a joke.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.720]   That's somebody posting is Sarah Lane.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720]   I'm not going to read that one.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   - Check the IP address.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720]   - Yeah, right.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.400]   Sarah Lane got voted up because I think people thought it was Sarah Lane.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.280]   She says, "I want to cover WWDC.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   It's true.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.320]   And as the only qualified woman on staff at Twitter, I deserve it."
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   That's not Sarah Lane talking.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.040]   I can tell you right now.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   And by the way, yes.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]   Come on in, Sarah.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.000]   You could be on this show.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   Martin Harrow on the Hill.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.480]   In fact, I think she's planned to be.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   Martin Harrow on the Hill.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.720]   Harrow, Greater London, H.A.1 UK.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.560]   Hello, Martin.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.520]   We see a range of Ibacon, Apple, and approved.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.080]   MFI B, a set.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.440]   Oh, I like that.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   Made for Ibacon, accessories for multiple use cases, launched to complement the home,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.400]   I family services.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.920]   I think if they announce a home service, it will use Ibacon.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   - Will they?
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.160]   Will they be an approved for Ibacon?
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.000]   Made for Ibacon approval process?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.600]   - One of the things that Apple does need to make the case of, and I think WWDC is a good
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:33.320]   place to do that, is making a case for how to use Ibacon, and not just as an ad server.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:38.560]   And so I think that figuring out ways to, whether it's at a museum or at a shopping mall,
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.320]   but not a shopping mall, I want to send you ads, but I want to know where my kids are.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.680]   I want to know where to find a specific store.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.480]   There's a lot of use cases for Ibacon, and right now, those are the ones we've seen,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.320]   have been horrible, just blatant ad-serving solutions.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.320]   And I don't think that that's really, that's not what you want first to get people using
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.320]   it.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.360]   - Here is our beat of the week from Indian EDM producer Metro Gannom.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:15.520]   It's the iPhone ringtone, mixed with Siri, to make a dance tune every Apple fan of love.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   - See, work on the bridge to the Enterprise D, that's a really cool interface that's
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520]   got in front of them.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.120]   - That's a NPC, it looks like the Akai actually bought that for my son, he couldn't figure
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   how to use it.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.520]   - I still have it, in fact, who did I give that to?
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   I gave it to Jason Howell.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:40.360]   - The DJs love these, they're called NPCs, and you can assign to the tap pads different
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360]   sounds.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.520]   It's kind of a thin, mousie kind of thing, I like this.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520]   - I want this as my ringtone.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.080]   Look at this Jason, are you using that NPC I gave you?
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   You better be.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.920]   - Promise it everyone, they're using most of my studio setup right now.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920]   - Okay, it just looks good though.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920]   - I have it, oh yeah.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.920]   - Oh, it looks nice to us.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.600]   - It makes things guess, it also takes up a lot of space, so I have to figure things
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.600]   out.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.600]   - It's huge, it's got a hard drive.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.360]   - But yeah, that on the left, that's the CUNIO, it's like that.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.960]   - That's the one we talked about, which is really cool.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   - We reviewed it on very affordable, that's a...
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.960]   - He's using both of them.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.240]   - Like 200 bucks, what's the one on the right, is that an a Kai?
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.840]   - That looks like an NPC to me.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:18.840]   - Yeah, definitely an NPC.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.480]   - Yeah, I'm not sure which one.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.080]   This sounds good, oh here comes Siri.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.640]   - I'm sorry, I couldn't make that happen.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   I guess the network was down when he reported this.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:39.160]   - This is good.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.360]   - Promise everyone keeps on checking their phone while they're listening to it.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.040]   - This should be the theme for Macbreak.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.480]   - I wanna, yeah.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.080]   - Let's contact him and see if we can buy it.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.800]   I'd love to make this the theme for Macbreak.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.760]   - Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.960]   - Oh, I wanna buy this.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.160]   - Yeah.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:11.160]   - Welcome to the club.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.240]   - I think they're in all of the Marine chains, right?
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.440]   They're all the sounds.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.520]   - From Metro, no, no, no.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.120]   - Oh, that's cute, he uses name.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.920]   The DJs do that, he's big.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   I get your name in there.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.360]   - But would Apple allow you to use, like, properly patented up to the...
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.080]   - Copyrighted up piece of music.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.640]   - Drop it.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   - Drop it.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.880]   - This is quite good.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.520]   This guy's got some skill.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.160]   - Looks like we're a key-tar, though.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.720]   - Jason, pretty good, huh?
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.440]   This guy's good.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.400]   Can you steal this and we can use it as a theme?
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.480]   He's not doing it on an Intel tablet.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.760]   - No.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.080]   That's the best EDM I've ever heard.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.040]   I love that.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.040]   That's a Metro Ginoam.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.480]   He's on Twitter as @metrogonam.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   I like that.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.680]   Yeah, that would be a better theme than what we got.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.120]   Uh, duh, duh, duh.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.480]   I think we're done here.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.880]   Anything you guys, did I miss any stories?
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.680]   - Sorry.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.120]   - That's why I was trying to figure out...
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.520]   - I was trying to figure out where the guy is.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.360]   - He's in India.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.120]   - I know, I know.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.600]   - Mm.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.880]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.240]   You're a picture of the week, my friends.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.480]   Get them fired up.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.400]   'Cause we got a few more minutes on this show.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.000]   Our show brought to you today by Squarespace.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.840]   I'm sitting with the Squarespace King.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.480]   Alex Lindsey Single-handedly has created
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.760]   more Squarespace sites than any human alive.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.600]   - You just saw another one.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.960]   There was somebody I was looking at.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.800]   - So good.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.880]   - And you wanna be like this person.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.160]   Like, who was like, I was at somebody's website
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.480]   and I was like, I'm just gonna call them and just say,
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:04.040]   "Hey, here's the deal, I'll do your site for you."
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:04.880]   Just to point. - It's easy.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.800]   - When I get there, it won't be hard to use.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.200]   - You've done that before.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.040]   Like, 'cause you get two weeks free.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.200]   You go, let me just do a site.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.000]   And here it is.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.400]   And if you want it, go buy it.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.040]   Use the offer code, Macbreak, and you get 10% off.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.400]   - And it's not for them, it's for me.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.640]   'Cause I have to go to their site.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.240]   - And I'm like, I just don't want this.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.920]   - Squarespace is really brilliant.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.880]   It's hosting and software.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.240]   And sometimes we talk about it as if it's all about the software,
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.080]   but it's also about the best hosting ever.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.600]   They're really committed to giving you, as a user,
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.040]   a great hosting service.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.080]   It's beautiful designs, mobile ready,
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   e-commerce enabled in every single case.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.280]   The best support in the world,
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.960]   they just watched one four webby awards for their designs.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.240]   They also do incredible apps for iPhone and iPad.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.880]   The Squarespace metric app lets you check page views,
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.120]   unique visitors, social media follows the blog app.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.120]   Let's, it makes it easy to post,
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.920]   but you can also monitor comments.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.680]   Just gorgeous, and this all includes the best hosting in the world.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.920]   I don't know how you can get any better than this.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.400]   You know we love Squarespace.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.960]   We've been with them since almost the beginning.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.280]   And as they've grown, we've been really happy
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.960]   to be part of that.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.520]   Visit squarespace.com, just click the Get Started button
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.080]   and you can play with it for two weeks.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.280]   You don't need to give them a credit card,
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.280]   you don't need to give them anything.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.760]   But if you decide you wanna buy,
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.280]   do give them the offer code Macbreak,
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.200]   'cause that'll get you started for 10% off.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.720]   As little as $8 a month plus,
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.480]   you get the domain name free when you purchase it for a year,
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.280]   which you're gonna wanna do.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.840]   Grady commerce solutions too.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.440]   They've, you know, it just gets better and better all the time.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.800]   Squarespace.com.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.040]   Time for picks of the week.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.320]   Let's start with Renee Ritchie this time.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.760]   - So my pick of the week is the new version of DJ, DJ 2.5.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.400]   It's made by Algabirium. - This is classic.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.800]   - And what they did is so smart
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.240]   because they had already done a great job
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.000]   in bringing all your iTunes music
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   into a sort of a skeuomorphic mixing environment on the iPad.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.160]   And now they have a deal with Spotify.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.480]   So you can have access to, I think it's 20 million songs.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.800]   As long as you have a Spotify premium.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.120]   And it's incredibly fast.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.680]   I thought there'd be problems with latency and downloads.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.600]   It is so fast it almost seems native.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.480]   And they also do a couple incredible things.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   So for example, if a song is new
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.440]   because it's hard to know 20 million songs,
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.320]   they will automatically match the track
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.240]   so that you can mix two songs together.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.960]   Even if you haven't heard the song,
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.680]   it uses algorithms to do that.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.880]   And if you wanna share your library in the old days,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.400]   you'd share your list and people would have to go buy the songs.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   If the other person is a Spotify user,
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.920]   they just get your mix.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.320]   And because they also have Spotify,
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.160]   all the songs come along with it.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.000]   - Oh man.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.160]   - It is the closest I've come to seeing pure magic
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.680]   in an audio form on a mobile device.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.200]   - Remember what DJ's used to come with a box on these discs?
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.160]   - This is a bottomless box.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.600]   - So I just wanna say.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.640]   - It always has a good song on top of it.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.160]   - If somebody comes up to you at the wedding and says,
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.160]   "Can you play the ventures?"
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.480]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.920]   So I DJed 400 weddings, my 100 years.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.040]   And I used to carry the kit to actually
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.320]   to do the actual DJing was tiny.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.960]   And it was actually, I was back in the day
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.480]   when I had two MK 400s.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.120]   And then I got a Denon 2200 CD.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:24.960]   - So much better.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.480]   - CD that I had cross made and everything else.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.320]   I kept on telling everyone,
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.800]   eventually this is all gonna be on a hard drive
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.840]   and you're just be able to play it all back
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.080]   and they ever thought I was crazy.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.320]   So, but the, when I look at this and just like,
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.480]   "You kids know, no, we used to tape everything
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.480]   'cause we didn't have, you know,
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.960]   we just boxes and boxes and boxes of songs."
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.800]   And then you'd forget the--
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.500]   - Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro,
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.800]   you know, MVZ and DJ.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.920]   - There's an iPad version, there's also an iPhone version.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.720]   I think there's still a lot of fail.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.880]   I've had a chance several times to talk to the--
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   - It makes me wanna-- - Make me wanna
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.720]   rejoin Spotify.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.320]   - You left Spotify?
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.800]   - Yeah, 'cause I have Google music.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.640]   - So confused.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.840]   - And I have Amazon, I don't need to--
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.440]   - So with DJ, are you able, does it keep track
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.320]   of the cross fades between, so if you're sharing your playlist
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320]   with someone else with DJ, you would get the,
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.560]   'cause one of my big complaints as a DJ, former DJ,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.600]   is I don't want the songs to stop.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.120]   I wanna be able to share a playlist
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.280]   that has all the cross fades built in.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.320]   Do you know if you can do that Renee?
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.840]   - I believe it does, I couldn't get a Spotify account.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.120]   I believe they're in Canada, but they wouldn't let me sign up
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.960]   for one, so I couldn't test that part of it.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.920]   But I got a demo from Karim and Michael Simmons
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.000]   who was working with them, and it just sounded fantastic.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.600]   - How much is DJ?
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.440]   - 2.5.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.480]   - It's on sale right now, I think the iPhone version
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.960]   is temporarily free unless it's verded already,
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.840]   and the iPad version could be on sale from 5box.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.160]   - 9, oh, am.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.480]   - Oh, look, it's like the sale's over.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.960]   - No, no, no, it's free for iPhones.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.800]   This is the iPhone version is free, right?
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.920]   - 4.99 for iPad, OMG.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.240]   - It's a steal.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.840]   - Well, I imagine that they get a cut from Spotify,
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.480]   so who needs to charge, right?
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.320]   That is so, that's like, that's a no-brainer.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.160]   Sign up for Spotify.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.920]   - Well, they're absolutely, again, this is a sale price,
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.560]   they're absolutely usually a couple of months.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.880]   - I see you get that VC interface and all of that.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.920]   - And they color code the music wave
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.280]   so that you can see what's vocals
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280]   and what's different instruments,
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.560]   so if you want to use the waveform,
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.600]   you can still tell where you want to transition
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.880]   based on the color of the line.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.720]   - Wow.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.480]   By the way, I'm now in love with Metronome.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.120]   Adi Metronome lives in Los Angeles.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.840]   I've just gone to his SoundCloud.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.240]   He has lots of free downloads.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.360]   Here's his Breaking Bad remix.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.640]   He does, I like this guy.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.480]   - Yeah, we should.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.840]   - I can download the iPhone thing.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.160]   I should talk to him and say how much
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.800]   if we plug you every single time or something.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.760]   - I love this.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.840]   - Oh, the other, one thing I was going to mention
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.200]   is this is an example of skeomorphism done right
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.320]   because they will render the--
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.160]   - Oh yeah.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.680]   - --to use on the album according to the actual music
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.120]   so that you can see where the song is on the album art.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.880]   - Mind, blown, blown, just amazing.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.240]   - Yeah, they've got serious skills.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.880]   - Alex, Lindsey, you're pick of the week.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.200]   - So I have this issue in Africa that I don't speak French.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.960]   So in about half of Africa speaks French.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.480]   I keep working on a French crew all last week.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.560]   And I feel bad that they speak English
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.000]   and I can't say anything.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.080]   And so I've decided that I wanted to go back and do that.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.280]   But one of the things that's been stopping me
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.120]   is that Rosetta Stone didn't have the ability to do,
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.720]   like being able to, they have this little thing
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.560]   where you hit on, they show you the word
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.240]   and then you have to find the right one in the picture.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.160]   And it's just the way to learn languages.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.400]   - Oh, but you seem to do a lingo, right?
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.680]   - Yeah, but you like Rosetta Stone better.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.280]   - Yeah, I find that Rosetta Stone is a better structure
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.120]   than to a lingo.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.440]   I think do lingo is great for the price.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.280]   - It's free.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.120]   - It's free.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.640]   - Rosetta Stone's like 800 bucks.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.080]   - Two hundred for like six months of unlimited.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.800]   But they have a lot, the software is better, in my opinion.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.320]   - They're the kings of this business.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.960]   - Right, and so they didn't have it, but I went back
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.720]   and I was like, I'm gonna go back and look at the iPad app.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.840]   And so my recommendation is the Rosetta Stone,
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.640]   if you get the thing where you have the iPad app.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.840]   - But you have to pay for Rosetta Stone to use this.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.440]   - Yeah, you have to pay for Rosetta Stone to use it.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.600]   But the point is, is that it's just the best,
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.600]   in my opinion, it's still the best way to learn a language.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.200]   See?
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.200]   - I'm good.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.440]   I'm better as you are. - You're good.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.800]   - Oh, I got it right.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.640]   - Yeah, see?
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.480]   - I'm good.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.480]   I'm better as you are.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.320]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.320]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.320]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.160]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.000]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:45.840]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.680]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.600]   - I'm better as you are.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.120]   - Lee.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.960]   - So, and this is, they have more to it.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.440]   This is how they get you started.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.720]   - Yeah, this is easy.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.760]   - Fee.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.040]   I should let Renee do this.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.360]   He's the Francophone here.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.600]   So this is the beginning, right?
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.680]   - This is the very beginning of it.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.520]   - Fum.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.960]   - Does this is a really great problem?
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.120]   If they could like train you to do
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.080]   an actually good Scottish accent.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.040]   (laughing)
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:17.880]   - Gar.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.720]   - Or?
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.760]   - Oh.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.080]   - So.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.400]   - So.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.240]   - So.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.080]   - So.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:25.920]   - So.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.920]   - Oh.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:27.760]   - So.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.280]   - Oh, so it does.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.600]   - So.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.440]   - Got a so.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.280]   - Well, I know how to say it.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280]   I'm trying to say it badly.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.120]   - Yes.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:35.960]   (bell ringing)
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.800]   - Garoson.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.680]   - Yeah, see, there's a problem right there.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.000]   - But, so it's not.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.840]   (laughing)
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   - So this part. - There's teaching in a dig.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.160]   - So, and this pronunciation part
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.920]   is actually the part that I don't like.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.560]   Because then I have to do it in the airport.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.400]   (laughing)
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.640]   And so the part that I like is that they have one
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.640]   where you're identifying,
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.080]   you can have your headphone on,
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.680]   and it's just showing you the words and you're identifying.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.360]   - Yeah, I mean, you wanna learn the language,
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360]   probably pronunciation you should learn by speaking.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.840]   It's native speakers anyway.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.320]   - Well, and I don't care about the pronunciation,
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.480]   but what I like about it is the multiple choice
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.080]   of the letters, and I find that what happens
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.840]   is you start learning a bunch of nouns,
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.520]   and when you start learning all the nouns,
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.080]   you start understanding what everyone's saying around you
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.920]   and then everything else.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.480]   - I agree, I agree.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.480]   - And the problem is I thought that I used to complain
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.320]   about Rosetta Stone, because like,
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.920]   it's just the nouns, I wanna say hi,
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   I wanna learn how to say where's the bathroom.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   But the reality is, is what really gets you going
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.280]   is actually what, once you understand
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:30.040]   what the substance of what people are doing,
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   it's a lot easier to learn.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040]   - Is the app free if you have a Rosetta Stone account?
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:33.880]   Is that how it works?
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.000]   - Yes, you get a Rosetta Stone account,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.520]   you get the app as a free download,
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.960]   and then you can use it on your iPhone and iPad
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.800]   and everything else,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.200]   and it just means that you can sit there in the airport,
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.440]   and I have a lot of downtime in airports.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.000]   Like where you're standing there in line,
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.040]   and so on and so forth,
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.800]   and I'm trying to fill it with something other
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.880]   than field runners, and so it could be a,
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.800]   - It's a bad time, you got off that game.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.920]   - Let's say Andy and I go, what's your pick of the week?
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.000]   - Mine is an easy one, this is the Sandisk Cruiser Fit,
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.460]   USB flash drive, 'cause I have,
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.400]   of course, when I bought the new MacBook Pro,
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.280]   having a reasonable amount of storage
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.400]   for someone like me was not an option.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.640]   So you look for ways to actually get better storage.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.760]   The great thing about this thing
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.880]   is that it's a tiny, tiny little flash drive
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   that barely adds anything to the width or the size of your--
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880]   - You look dungly, that's small.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.360]   - Exactly, so I can put this in any bag
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.040]   that I have without really worrying about it.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.200]   It doesn't hang, it doesn't pull,
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.840]   it doesn't damage anything,
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:36.080]   and they have capacities all the way down to four,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.240]   all the way up to 64 gigs,
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.480]   and it's only USB 2.0, I wish it were USB 3.0,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.400]   but that's not a deal breaker for me,
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.360]   but it's the perfect thing for keeping music and movies
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.920]   and photos that I don't wanna clutter up my 256 gig internal.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.240]   As always, it only took me about three or four months
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.160]   to wish I'd gone for the,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.000]   I wish I'd maxed out the SSD, but I didn't, and so now.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.360]   - Have you seen the nifty mini drive?
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.800]   - This was a Kickstarter project I contributed to.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.360]   The idea is it fits in the USB port,
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.400]   it fits in your SD card slot,
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.480]   and so it's kind of more permanent,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.760]   and it doesn't have anything sticking at all.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.400]   - I don't like that at all,
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.400]   A, because you do have to have a paperclip
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.880]   or something handy to take it out,
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.080]   and frankly, I mean, frankly, it's like,
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.680]   but my SD card slot is something that I use a lot.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.880]   So to do it, it would be such a pain in the butt.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.760]   For us, I've got two USB ports here,
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.600]   I'm rarely using more than one of them,
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.080]   so this thing can basically live in here
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.320]   without any difficulties,
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.960]   and I'll be very, very happy about it.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.320]   I mean, as you can see, I bought one,
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.640]   I liked it so much that I bought a second one,
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:48.240]   partly because I left the original in its Windows format,
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.840]   and now I need to format this as a Mac volume,
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.280]   because now that I've got like Blu-ray rips
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.040]   that are larger than a couple of gigabytes,
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.320]   I need to be able to write really, really big files,
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.360]   but I wanted to get one anyway,
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.200]   because these are just so, so useful.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.280]   - Well, it's more expensive too,
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.880]   'cause the mini drive doesn't come with any memory,
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.480]   so you have to buy a micro SD card
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.120]   to stick in the mini drive.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.800]   - But that means that you can keep on upgrading them.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.640]   - Right. - You know,
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.440]   that's the big thing, 'cause those micro SDs
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.720]   keep on getting bigger.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.800]   - Yeah, and now the maximum size in that is 128,
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.560]   and so, as soon as Sandis makes 120 gig one of these,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.400]   I'm definitely buying one.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.880]   - Awesome. It's nice to have this.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:25.520]   - It's nice to be able to simply offload stuff
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.320]   that doesn't need that super high speed bus access to it,
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.080]   and you have the ability to unplug this
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:31.920]   and put it someplace else.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.760]   But I'm sort of in the habit now of,
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.560]   I always have a bunch of movies and TV shows
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:37.400]   I like to carry with me,
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.720]   so now it lives on,
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.480]   it's one of the things that live on this little drive,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.040]   which also means that I can just plug this right into
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.640]   the USB port of any other device I own,
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.400]   or even the Roku,
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.440]   right before the show I was watching "Blazing Saddles"
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.680]   and HD that I just ripped over the weekend.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.600]   And the fact that I moved from this to something else
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.960]   means that I'll always have it with me.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:57.800]   But it looks great.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.480]   It's only for 64 gigabyte thing,
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.820]   it's only about 30,
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.200]   list price 70, but of course,
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.880]   that street price is about 30, 35,
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.480]   so it gets definitely reachable and affordable.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.040]   - My pick is something that,
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.520]   I have so much pain with my email,
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.840]   and I like everybody's Gmail,
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.560]   and that is one area where Maverick says,
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.280]   "Let us down," and it's not really Apple's fault,
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.160]   because Gmail is not a standard IMAP client,
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.840]   it's something special.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.440]   And there are very few email clients
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.960]   that handle Gmail properly,
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.840]   you pretty much have to use the web interface.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.720]   So I've been looking for a way to do email better,
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.760]   it's involved leaving Gmail,
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.320]   going to an IMAP, a true IMAP provider,
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.520]   in my case I'm using FastMail,
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.720]   which I really like and I've used for years.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.560]   And then I was looking for a power tool.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.720]   Now Apple's mail works fine with FastMail,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.280]   but I got something called MailMate.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.480]   This is a single guy, a developer in Copenhagen,
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.720]   he's an academic,
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.800]   he's been writing it for some time.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.920]   In fact, he did an indiegogo project
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.480]   to kind of support a year's worth of development,
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.800]   he's working on version 2.0 right now.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.480]   I was really pleased I installed it
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.760]   because I was downloading seven years of Gmail
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.680]   it crashed a few times
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.480]   and I immediately got an email from him,
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.680]   saying I see it's crashed, can I help you?
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.760]   He's really responsive.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.880]   And I'll show you MailMate,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.680]   there's some things that I really like about it,
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.080]   it reminds me a lot of the old school email programs.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.240]   First of all, great settings in many, many ways,
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.240]   you can make it your default viewer of course,
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.040]   you can have Gmail key bindings,
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.720]   if you're really tied to Gmail,
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.600]   you can turn on Gmail key bindings.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.680]   So you'll be able to use all the key strokes
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.120]   that you normally use.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.400]   It has little, in doc and in menu bar displays.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.880]   In fact, I like the menu bar display
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.120]   because then you can see what kind of,
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.040]   what email's sitting there and how long it's been there
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:49.880]   and what's new and all,
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.720]   you don't have to show that,
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.480]   I just, mostly it's spam right now.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.080]   It supports Spam Civ,
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.400]   it has support for PGP,
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.680]   which was really important to me.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.240]   I need to have S-Mime or PGP encryption
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.840]   and it's built in automatic.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.480]   If you have open PGP installed, it'll immediately,
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.200]   I use GPG tools, it'll automatically do that.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.120]   It does support IMAP style tagging,
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.720]   which is not unfortunately the same as Gmail style tagging.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.800]   But the thing I really like about it is,
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.400]   you can create very powerful searches very easily.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.760]   For instance, if I wanted to search for all the emails
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.840]   I've received from the Humble Bundle,
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.560]   I can literally just double click in the header,
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.800]   the Humble Bundle and show me all the emails I've received
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:30.840]   from the created instance search,
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.360]   which I can then save.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.560]   It does conversation threading, which is very handy.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.440]   And it picks up the,
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.120]   you know, if you look at the column on the left,
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.720]   I realize this is small, it picks up
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.440]   the, of course, the IMAP setup.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.680]   And I'm using, I do my filtering on the IMAP side,
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.120]   FASML is a very powerful script language for filtering,
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.200]   but you could do filtering and hear it supports it.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.560]   And it does some really interesting things.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.400]   Let me show you my VIP mailbox.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.320]   So I have FASML filtering, certain people into VIP.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.560]   But if I edit this mailbox, I can say,
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:07.080]   create submailboxes for each sender or each two or whatever.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.200]   These are all the different things.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.040]   And it actually created, as you can see over here,
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.920]   on the left, submailboxes for all the VIPs
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.200]   and the different email addresses that they're of.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.480]   That's really handy.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.680]   It's, it's, as I use it, it's become more and more of a power tool.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.160]   I've been looking for a really good email client
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.680]   to replace Apple Mail, live on Apple Mail for years.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.880]   But I think, you know, and this is in active development.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.560]   That's another thing to be said for it,
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.280]   unlike a lot of the email programs, PM Mail and stuff
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.400]   that I've been using for so long.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.560]   Mail made is the name of it.
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.960]   It is from f-r-e-r-o-n.com.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.840]   It supports Markdown, which is really nice.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.120]   You don't have to use HTML.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.680]   You can use Markdown to create tables and so forth.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.520]   It doesn't really smart things.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:55.960]   It knows which signature to use based on previous
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.520]   conference, you know, conversations.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.920]   It does work offline, of course, as a good, any good email tool does.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.600]   And as you see, he raised money.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.680]   He raised $42,000 at Indiegogo in a crowdfunding campaign,
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.680]   171% of what he was asking for so that he could
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.520]   do version two of this.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:18.920]   And so he's dedicating his all year to update this.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.200]   So I wanted to give him a little plug.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.560]   He's been very helpful, really, really nice guy.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.600]   And I like the tool.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.640]   I've been using it.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.880]   Don't-- you know, you can use it with Gmail.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.640]   But just like Apple's mail, Gmail has such weird issues.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.680]   The chief issue is that you can assign multiple tags to a single email.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.440]   And iMac doesn't support that.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.400]   So it will very much confuse your mailing mail client.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.800]   But I like mail made a lot.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.520]   I highly recommend it.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.600]   Oh, not free, but you can try it for free.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.560]   $50 to buy.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.800]   I think it's $50 to me.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.680]   Can you definitely check it out?
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.760]   Is worth it for a good email client?
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:54.920]   It's something you use every day all day.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.160]   And by the way, a little tip for you.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:03.320]   I created a filter rule that says if the word unsubscribe is in the body of the email,
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.000]   put that in a folder.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.400]   I call it mailing list.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.840]   I should call it bacon.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.200]   That eliminates like 90% of the crap in my mailbox that I want to see.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.040]   It's really useful.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.800]   And then you can unsubscribe at your leisure rules with the key to the operation.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.200]   I think I have like 50 or 60 hours rules.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.600]   And this is where fast mail is fabulous.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.920]   And I guess that's a secondary recommendation.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.680]   It was bought by opera.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.960]   The Australian developers bought it back just about a year ago.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.400]   And it is the IMAP.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400]   In my opinion, the IMAP client.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.080]   It's just incredible.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.960]   And I do all my rules on their side just because it's easier.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.360]   I can write a script and I can actually use BB Edit and do my script by hand.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.760]   Once you learn the language, it's not too complicated.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.680]   And then it's easy to modify and so forth.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:47.720]   Very powerful.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.800]   So there you go.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.760]   There's my pick of the week.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.520]   Hey, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.480]   Mac break weekly.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:58.680]   Remember next week we're on Monday right after the keynote at WWDC.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.360]   My guess is we'll have a lot to say.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.000]   I think so.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:01.880]   I think some exciting.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.760]   I think we might have some.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.080]   I hope.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.320]   Crossing my fingers.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.520]   Mailmate is not in the app store.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.840]   You have to get it from the developer.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.040]   Andy Inako Chicago, sometimes he's going to be out here.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.040]   So we'll have him in studio always fun next week after the conference.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.360]   And you'll go to the keynote and the rest of the conference too.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.160]   Happy to have you here for that.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.320]   Renee Ritchie, imore.com.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.160]   He'll also be down for Montreal.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:25.560]   Yep.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.440]   So that'll be fun.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.680]   And Alex Lindsey, you'll be in studio again next week too.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.240]   I will be.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.920]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.520]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.440]   Otherwise Tuesday is 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.200]   And if you watch live, it's really great because we do the question engine.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.480]   We've got the chat room.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.160]   Really nice to have the feedback.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.720]   So please watch live if you can't on-demand audio and video available as with all our shows
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.840]   at our website after the fact, twit.tv/mbw for Mac break weekly.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.120]   Or wherever you get your shows, including Stitcher.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:01.240]   And don't forget our great twit apps developed by independent third party developers who are
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.040]   just fabulous.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:07.720]   There's apps for iOS, Android, Windows, phone, Roku and on and on.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:09.800]   We'll see you next time.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.160]   Now get back to work because you know what?
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.440]   Break time is over.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:22.440]   [MUSIC]
