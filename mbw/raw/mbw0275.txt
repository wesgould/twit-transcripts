[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show that covers Apple.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.400]   And sometimes Mac-a-tush.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.720]   Not so much Mac-a-tush anymore.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.920]   I don't know if Mac-a-tush has long to live.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.960]   Joining us now, Alex Lindsay's off today,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.360]   but Andy and Ocko is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.840]   And the celestial waste took band with, hey, Andy.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.560]   Congratulations on another successful trip around the sun.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   Yes, thank you.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   It's my birthday today.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.160]   Oh, well, I didn't want it to say happy birthday.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.560]   I know, because I'm not happy.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.680]   You don't celebrate that.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.440]   But another trip around-- very few people manage
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   a full trip around the sun.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   50-trappy.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.720]   You've got a free ride, so let's not give you the full credit.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.480]   The cabbie is very, so far, very generous.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.520]   I haven't been asked for anything.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600]   Still tip-- tip your god, gratefully.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.560]   I shall.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.360]   At the end of the ride.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   He will include an 18% gratuity at the end of the ride.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.080]   I'm going to give him a carrot cake.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.120]   How about that?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.080]   That's cool.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.960]   Also joining us from Mac-a-wese Canada is Mac-a-wese Ken.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.040]   Ken Ray, good to see you, Ken.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.160]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah, happy hunting.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.840]   What do you-- we've talked with the panel a lot
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.520]   about the end of Macintosh.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.960]   And what we're going to call this show--
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.320]   Mac World Expo has changed its name to iWorld.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   They've added iWorld, yeah.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.200]   I don't know if we can call this iBreak Weekly.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   I think that sounds pretty awful.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.120]   Almost painful.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.640]   So--
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400]   Sounds like something happens in a jet-lea movie, yeah.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.600]   Yeah, iBreak Weekly.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.100]   So--
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600]   Go back together.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.080]   Go back out there to complete my machete.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   So I just feel like that--
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.000]   between the iOSification of Mac OS 10 Lion,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.200]   and really Apple just doing so well with iOS
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.040]   that you just wonder how much--
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560]   and the iPad, especially how much interest
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.400]   they have in Macintosh.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.320]   Well, I mean, you've already got rumors this week.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.720]   There are some Mac rumors, yeah.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.120]   Yeah, about the 15-inch thing with the 15-inch MacBook Air.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.680]   So I mean, it's still kicking.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.760]   As long as somebody I read said, as long
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.400]   as they keep spending money on both the MacBook Pro
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.880]   and the MacBook Air, they'll keep both alive.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.280]   So obviously, the Mac's not going anywhere.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   Yeah, well, the Mac Pro might be, though.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.440]   And that's what a number of times we've talked about that
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.800]   on the show that the Mac Pro might be, in fact, doomed.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.960]   And also, the Mac's desktops are not--
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.400]   the Mac desktops and notebooks.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   It's not like they're lost leaders.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.040]   I mean, they are actually contributing to the bottom line.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.600]   And also, there's just the psychological effect
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.960]   that even if Apple decided to say, no, we're kind of--
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.040]   we don't like making that much extra money per year
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.480]   off of a product line that's extremely successful.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.680]   Do you think that even internally at Apple,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.320]   they could be happy being just a mobile computing company?
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720]   Well, you've got to figure that at least half of the company
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.480]   would just plots if they would--
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.120]   They came there to--
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.400]   They're saying nothing on the covalent.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.720]   The coval that plots, they messugge.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.280]   I mean, they came there, didn't they, to make Macintoshes.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.360]   That's really where this all began for a lot of them,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.240]   maybe with the Apple II.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.600]   But I think the Macintoshes really went Apple.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.360]   Took off.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.400]   Yeah, so the rumor is they'll be a 15-inch year.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.480]   And I know that that's true because I just bought a 13-inch
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.240]   year.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.000]   I was my birthday present to myself.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.480]   I had the old, the 2010 11-inch.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.840]   And I thought I'd--
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.880]   you know, it was Jason Stell last week, Andy, that did it to me.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.240]   He had the air.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.680]   I don't know if it was 11 or 13, but he said,
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.120]   oh, it's so much faster.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.600]   It's the I-5.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.520]   Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.600]   I got-- all right, all right.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.080]   I guess I'll--
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.280]   That's absolutely true.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.840]   But I'm trying to navigate the question of,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.280]   are we going to break the MacBook Air concept
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.880]   by making it into a big MacBook Air?
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   Right.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.280]   I really-- I still think that the sweet spot is still
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   the 11-inch.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.840]   This thing, you can just tuck to the magazine pocket
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.040]   of pretty much anything you're carrying.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.640]   I do have weird geek pants in which you can fit a MacBook
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.880]   Air into the back pocket.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.680]   I know that not everybody wears pants that
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.960]   are tailored for shoplifting, but still, that's
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.400]   quite an achievement.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   I just got a Scottie Vest vest that has a pouch for the--
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.100]   --air.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.640]   I think we're going to find out that most Mac people are
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   going to start left shopping at military and police
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   equipment stores.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.800]   So carry their air.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.600]   The ceramic plate that is actually designed to stop bullets
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.320]   like that's built into a vest or a shirt, tactical shirt,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.960]   is probably about the right size for 11 and share.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.400]   But the thing is, how much more convenient
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   is it going to be to have a still that same 15-inch form
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.240]   factor you're still huge now it's just thin.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640]   And it's maybe a few pounds lighter.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.960]   Now, I'll still have to carry that big bag.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.560]   I'll still have a little bit of trouble
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.720]   getting through airports.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.880]   Like, it'll still be the sort of thing
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.080]   where they're going to probably ask you to take it out
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.360]   of the bag.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.800]   Rest with these smaller errors.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.040]   I think they even say that, no, it's a simple enough device
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   with a simple enough shadow that they can allow you
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.360]   to put it on the belt.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.200]   So I'm really curious to see how well that works out.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.320]   But I guess the three of us are agreed
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   that we can elevate this from air quote rumor to solid rumor.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.120]   I think it's pretty clear this is such a--
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   the error is what is it?
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.000]   28% of their overall max sales seems pretty--
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yeah, but yeah.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.200]   I was looking at that figure and I was kind of questioning it
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.600]   because a lot of people are looking at that figure
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.040]   and comparing it to decline in netbook sales on the window
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.560]   side.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.880]   And I don't think they're really the same sort of situation
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.600]   at all.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.840]   Apple didn't decide to create this sort of edge case machine
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.080]   called the MacBook Air.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.360]   They put it front and center.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.320]   And they said that if you want--
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.000]   the default choice for a MacBook is now
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   designed to be the MacBook Airy, the 13 or the 11 inch.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.920]   And you have to be a special sort of person
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   in order to want the MacBook Pro now.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.680]   So I think that most consumers are just
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.120]   listening to what Apple is saying.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.480]   And also try to get out of there with spending the least
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.720]   amount of money to get a Mac.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   And that solution is the MacBook Air.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.480]   There's a couple of things to go ahead.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.600]   Go back a second on a couple of things.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.800]   First of all, I don't think the use case--
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.480]   and for you to me, I'm not a road warrior.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.440]   But I don't think the use case for the MacBook Air
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.000]   is the fact that it's that small thing.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.400]   Because you do also have the 13 inch
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.360]   and that does fold right into--
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.720]   I kind of interested to see a 13.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.880]   I mean, that's why I ordered the 13.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.280]   I love the 11, but I thought a little more screen real estate
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.680]   might be nice.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   I think that what's great about--
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.880]   it seems to me what's going to be great about pitching
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.920]   the 15 inch MacBook Air is the fact that it is thinner,
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.480]   it is lighter.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.720]   And of course, it's going to be the SSD, right?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.080]   It's not going to be relying on hard drive.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.600]   So it's going to push forward what they're trying to do that way.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.360]   Not just lack of hard drive, lack of optical drive.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.320]   And Apple's been great on this in terms of being way
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.680]   or somewhat ahead of the curve.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.600]   They dropped floppy disks.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.760]   They were the first to do it.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.120]   They were right.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.640]   They dropped firewire.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.680]   Well, nobody-- that was a unilateral move.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.280]   They've adopted Thunderbolt.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.080]   And I now think that dropping the optical drive
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   makes sense not just on the air, not just in the ultra lights,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.360]   but on all these machines.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   The ultra mobile PCs have optical drives, though, don't they?
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.280]   So that's kind of--
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   No, they don't.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.920]   Well, Intel is promoting this new thing
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.280]   called their Call of the Ultra book, which is really
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.640]   as close to MacBook Air as you can get.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.840]   It's the big duplicates, yeah.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.760]   Which tests me--
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.280]   Absolutely.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.320]   I've side by side pictures for an upcoming review
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.000]   of the Asus first Ultra book.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.360]   And man, it would have been so easy and so tempting.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.080]   A couple of weeks ago, to just say, when Apple finally
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.600]   needed to get their 11-inch air back,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   that was on loan for a few months,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.560]   to say, what if I were to forget this?
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.640]   Give them the Asus, the Windows 7 one back and up.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.440]   Because it really--
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.080]   The same shipping system.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   Oh, I thought it was the same.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.040]   I'm sure they'd catch on.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   I'm sure they'd be very upset.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.920]   And I wouldn't want to do that.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.280]   But it was tempting anyway.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.240]   Walt Moss, for sure.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.760]   What did this?
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.280]   Apple sent me a Windows machine.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.000]   It's like those stories you see every Christmas,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.880]   where somebody buys an iPhone from Walmart
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.560]   and they get it home and it's a canvas for it.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   No, no, you do like that.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.240]   You can use sardines to make a really good put-and-esque
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.720]   sauce.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.240]   I'm not sure what I would do with an in-home altar book.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.160]   But the cool thing, though, about the 15 inches,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.640]   is that just--
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.320]   It's enough real estate just physically
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   to stick in more batteries.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.000]   So this-- maybe we could look forward
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.840]   to having our first 10-hour MacBook.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.520]   I think the previous record was, what, eight and a half hours
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   for one of the earlier MacBook books?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.800]   I think there's 13--
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.160]   The other reason they get a 13 inches,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.960]   because I think it's almost--
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.160]   It's six hours?
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.080]   I think it's--
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.600]   I think that's rated eight.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.040]   That's rated eight.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.640]   I think-- but the 15 would--
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.800]   I would happily give up another half a pound.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.320]   You get 10.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.400]   Yeah, I mean, if I could get an iPad like battery life,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.160]   where not just absolutely-- not only getting
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   through an entire day, but flaunting the fact
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.200]   that I can get through a whole day,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.320]   not even having to think about how much time is left on the clock
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.760]   and even maybe not have to suffer if I
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   forget to recharge it overnight.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.920]   I love that.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.000]   I love that.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.680]   Can I come back to one of the thing really quickly
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.960]   to get a question for something you said, Andy.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.120]   You said that people are trying to draw a correlation
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.920]   between the slowdown in netbook sales with the rise
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.000]   in the sales of the MacBook Air.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   I thought that was more a correlation
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.840]   between the rise of the iPad.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.440]   I see the iPad as one of the netbook.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   I've seen a lot of people who are trying to say that the air
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.600]   is stealing purchases away from the netbooks.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.000]   I'm also saying that a lot of-- and also
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.800]   saying that, well, the ultra books are going to also doom
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.240]   the netbook.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.840]   I just don't think it's quite comparable.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.240]   But there are other factors that get scored with a kill.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.560]   And yeah, the iPad is certainly one of them.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.200]   When they're talking about sales of these devices being so
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   brisk, they were talking about sales figures
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   that are on the Intel side-- excuse me-- on the Windows
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   side that are pretty much like 1/4 to 1/5 across the board
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   with three or four different manufacturers,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.040]   just one fraction of what the iPad sales are.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.320]   And it's so bad that there's a rumor going around the Samsung
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.560]   is going to be leaving netbooks completely.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.720]   Oh, man.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.960]   That's an interesting development.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.320]   They actually make the best netbook,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.760]   but that's not saying much since they're pretty much crap.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.200]   Did you see the survey the other day?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.240]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.720]   I apologize.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.760]   I think it might have been NPD, but the survey that
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.400]   was about how tablets are doing besides the iPad?
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.960]   No, I'm sure not well.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.320]   I'm sure there are a fraction of iPad sales.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.120]   That was the thing.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.040]   It was kind of amazing to me because they went and they
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.600]   parsed out how everybody else was doing in tablets.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.120]   And of course, we don't have the Amazon Kindle Fire to compare
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   it to yet because-- well, we don't have numbers for them.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.800]   And even when we came--
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.400]   Amazon's Amazon.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   Yeah, but they do say it's the best selling.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   I mean, they say it's going out flying out the door.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.200]   They had quadruple sales on Thanksgiving Day.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.560]   I mean, they're doing all right.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.680]   Does that bother anybody besides me?
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.200]   That they lie?
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   I'm not saying they lie.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   They have to give them numbers.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   They say, yeah, things are going great.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.080]   Well, how great?
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.120]   Well, no great.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.040]   Well, I think Amazon has said they're still being cryptic,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.840]   but I think they still have said millions, which is significant
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.640]   given that it's only been out for a couple of weeks now.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   I don't know if they're--
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.920]   I have to double check on the quote.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.600]   I don't know if they're saying they've--
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.400]   I'm not sure exactly where the number comes from,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.960]   but where Amazon is concerned, normally they would sell
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   directly to the customer.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.240]   That would be a more significant number,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   but they're also selling through Best Buy.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.840]   They're also selling through regular brick and mortar
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.040]   retailers, so it could be just shipped to stores
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   as opposed to sell through.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   There's no question in my mind that the fire is going to--
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.200]   is first of all, the first decent Android tablet.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.200]   And is absolutely going to sell millions
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000]   before the end of the year.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.720]   They said they were making 5 million,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.280]   or somebody said they were making 5 million.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.400]   I think that that's not an unreasonable number.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.560]   At which point, all of those NPD numbers are meaningless,
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.320]   Ken, because they don't include the tablet,
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.200]   the competing tablet.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.680]   No.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.560]   Well, yeah, I just found it funny actually
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.720]   that they spend all this time.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.760]   I want to say they're efficient.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.280]   I want to say it was like since the first of the year,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.440]   they said that shipments had soared to--
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.200]   I can't remember how much, but it doesn't count as soaring
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.160]   when you compare even the weakest quarter this year of the iPad.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.480]   And then I think they said that they had taken in something
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.760]   like $412 million in retail for all of the tablets
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.720]   besides the iPad.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.640]   And so you go through and you're reading this thing
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   and you're like, wow, well, this tablet's doing really well.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.080]   And then you realize, because we're not comparing it
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.760]   to the tablet, as you say.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.120]   So it was kind of funny.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.400]   It's doing well for something that's not an iPad.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.160]   There's that guy who finished the marathon an hour ago.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.120]   And now here are all the other guys.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   Well, but I'll just stand around and clap for them anyway.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Yeah, they're the only three hours later.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   It's like the Boston Marathon and all the people
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   who finished the Boston Marathon in like two hours, 30 minutes.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.600]   It's like, oh, you stink.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.120]   The winner came back 20 minutes ago.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   Losers only run 26.2 miles in two and a half hours.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.520]   Hey, that sounds like a such a Boston thing.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   You're really strong.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.480]   We're trying to get to work here.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   They wicked mean.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.960]   We're pure in the fishing colony.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.600]   We just want to produce freedom as well.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.360]   That's it.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   And deficient to make growth.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.080]   You barely made it.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.800]   So I do think the fire is going to is.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.400]   I know I'm the only one on this panel.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.440]   In fact, I think I'm the only one in the entire twit.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.160]   No, no.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   You like it?
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.400]   I think the camera is awesome.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   I reviewed it.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   I liked it.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:26.600]   As a matter of fact, I just wrote a Mac world column that basically toned a toned down version
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.440]   of my reaction to a lot of the Mac communities and the iOS communities reaction to the Kindle,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.120]   which is that for God's sakes grow up.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.920]   And realize that, OK, you know what?
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.640]   Amazon did not build a clone of the iPad for $199.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.920]   They wisely, unlike Motorola, unlike HTC, unlike Samsung said, you know what?
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.760]   Apple's doing a really good job selling the something exactly like the iPad for $499.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.880]   Why don't we try to make something that we can sell for $199?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.000]   Because $199 a lot.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.800]   I benchmarked this myself is a great number less than $499.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   We have the numbers and it's less.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.360]   I'll give you a PDF of the independent testing company.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.920]   Would you like to see a graph?
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.120]   That would be a good graph.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   Show me how much.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   500, 200.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.920]   No, I am to my dismay.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.240]   I have not yet seen a Kindle fire.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   Let me say this.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Let me.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   I'm curious to see how it's going to go.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   I don't think.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.680]   Let me say this.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.800]   I think the fire.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:30.040]   Some people might say the fire is to the iPad what a netbook is to an air and I don't
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.280]   I don't agree.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.720]   I think it is not the netbook of tablets.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.040]   We've seen the netbook of tablets.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.280]   We'll call it the playbook.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.440]   It was called the zoom.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.880]   It was called the touch pad.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.920]   I think this stands on its own as an excellent device.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.880]   I don't have the laggy issues.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.800]   People other people have reported.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.720]   I think there are some QC issues with the first shipment, but I think it's fantastic.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.040]   I like this form factor.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   I think it's a great tablet.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   I would forgive me.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   Okay.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   Okay.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   Andy and then you can.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   Hold on.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.160]   I would go with the netbook comparison only in the sense that the way that I tend to explain
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.120]   it to people is that Apple did not make a version of the netbook when they built the
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   iPad.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.520]   They looked at the reasons why people are buying these things and try to figure out
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.560]   we don't have to build something exactly like this, but this is giving us some pointers
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.800]   into people what people want.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.960]   They want something with that's very, very small in light.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.080]   They want something with infinite battery life.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.360]   They don't need to run everything they would on a desktop, but they want to have a certain
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.440]   practical subset of those features.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.680]   So Apple said, how can we re-articulate that to something that's actually good instead
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.040]   of just a chopped down notebook?
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.920]   I don't think, I don't know if Amazon did this literally, but the fire looks like the
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.280]   exact same approach with the iPad saying that what if let's start off with the idea that
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.440]   we need to build this for $199?
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.400]   What are the features that people are compelled to, compelled towards for the iPad?
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.720]   If we can, what can we really focus on to make the best $199 product that we can?
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.160]   And the answer came back.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.000]   Content consumption.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.880]   Simple that people want to certain iPad like features like email and word processing,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.440]   but they don't have to really use it as a notebook replacement.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:14.120]   As long as they can do something as complicated as receive a word file as an email attachment,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.440]   read that file, make some notes on it, and send that file back to the person sent to
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   them.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.280]   That's pretty much as notebooky as you can get.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.480]   And I do think that it's a really good $109 tablet.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.840]   It's not a cut down anything.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.040]   I think it's a very good for what it is.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   Ken?
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.840]   Well, I had a, there's the research firm, Candelis, said earlier this year that next year after
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:39.080]   the iPad 3, Apple will be the number one computer seller in the world because they're going
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.160]   to go ahead and count iPads as PCs.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.160]   As they should.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   Okay.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.160]   Okay.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   So you think that's fair.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.440]   Then let me follow up with, do you do that with the fire?
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   That's an interesting thing.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   I would call you something else on that one.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.880]   Well, here's why I would argue no, Andy.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.520]   The fire is really very much a consumption device.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.120]   I thought the iPad was very much a content consumption device.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.040]   They've proven me wrong in that respect.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   The fire definitely is.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.400]   I mean, you could type on it and you can put ever note on it and you could use it to enter
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   data.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.080]   But I think you probably wouldn't.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   It's really a consumption device.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.040]   And I think that might be the dividing line between PC and appliance or CE device.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.360]   So who's going to decide that?
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   Well, not me, obviously.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.080]   I don't know why anybody should decide it.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.280]   It's that horse racing mentality, the media as we've got to put these in categories and
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.560]   this is winning.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.560]   And that this, you know, it's, there's tablets.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.360]   There's desktops, there's laptops, there's phones.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.280]   Those are all different devices as far as I'm concerned.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.760]   Yeah, I think that's, it's sort of like when you get so passionate about a movie that you
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.040]   have to know how much it made in the box office this week and did it beat the Smurfs
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.440]   or didn't it beat the Smurfs.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's all I care about is that I got, I got my iPad.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.720]   I love it.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.360]   Also that it's selling well enough that Apple has faith in it and it's not going to go away
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.520]   in the next couple of years.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   That's what matters.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   Right.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   The rest of that is just, you know, I'll be polite since this is an explicit, this pocket
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.080]   doesn't get the explicit tag.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.560]   This is just flag waving.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.520]   We're all getting out our flags and waving our flags.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   Right.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520]   And that's not a productive way to spend your afternoon.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.000]   It is something though that Apple fans like to do quite a bit of.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.840]   Well, I mean, it also goes back to the question that you asked at the beginning Leo, though,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.760]   about, you know, does Apple ever get out of the max, which I assume you're being partly
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.840]   facetious at least, but I mean, it, I mean, it does kind of go to that question.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.440]   If they stopped making the Mac one day, but they were still making the iPad and they were
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.360]   making bigger iPads, is Apple still in computers at that point?
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   And again, you're right.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   Who cares?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.360]   They're not going to get out of their name.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.440]   I think for a good reason.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.080]   This is, this is, I mean, you know, it's all, all bets are off now that Steve's gone, frankly,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.560]   I think that the company direction could change considerably.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:47.760]   I don't, you know, I mean, this is all had Steve still running the company, I think he
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.960]   would have dumped the desktops.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960]   Yes.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   Really?
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   Yes.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   I don't think so.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   I don't think so.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   Why?
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   I'm with Andy.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.920]   It's sort of like, it's sort of like a commercial airline deciding that I'm wearing American Airlines.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.280]   Bad, bad example is they just declared bankruptcy, but saying that, oh no, we're just going
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.080]   to ship cargo from now on.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.360]   So long as there's, if it's the other way around, it's the other way around it's saying
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.640]   we're not going to ship cargo.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.040]   We're just going to ship passengers.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.760]   We're going to go where the money is.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.720]   Well, what I'm saying is that a, an Apple computer that doesn't make desktops or doesn't
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.880]   make machines that run desktop operating systems is a lesser company.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.120]   So you're throwing away to 10 years worth of development on an operating system that's
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.400]   still exceptionally powerful.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.160]   And if you drop Mac OS, what happens?
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.200]   Those people, are they going to open source Mac OS?
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.600]   Is it going to be a remaining a community of people who are still going to be using
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.760]   Mac computers and Mac OS?
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.320]   No, they're going to switch to Windows.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.600]   Are they going to continue to go with an operating system that doesn't support iCloud
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.880]   as well as anything else, doesn't support iTunes as well as Mac OS didn't?
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   No, they might.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.920]   This is an opportunity for other media companies like, oh, I don't know, Amazon to step up
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.320]   and fill in that gap.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.960]   I just don't see any reality in which Apple would stop making, stop making desktops,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.000]   barring the sort of asteroid impact that would make our interest in consumer devices
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.480]   mark largely moot.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.800]   So let's hold off that optimism that there might be something that destroys all mammalian
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   life on earth.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   But barring that.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.160]   I think the desktops are going to stay.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.240]   I think I'm between the two.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.160]   I don't think it's way too early to talk about killing the desktop.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.000]   And I think if Steve Jobs were still running the company, they wouldn't be killing the
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.240]   desktop any time soon.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   But I think it'll happen.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.200]   Well, maybe not today, not tomorrow, but a few years from now.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.160]   The only real question is, well, then how do you develop for iPads if you don't have
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   desktops?
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.280]   I mean, that's such a small market.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.200]   Maybe they'll make Mac pros for people who...
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.400]   I think you're right.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.720]   It's the air and the iPad.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   They'll keep the air around.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.120]   I just don't think they're going to make big desktop machines anymore.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.520]   Maybe I could see that happening.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.760]   I could see them killing desktops easier than I could see them killing Mac OS itself.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.800]   Now, Mac OS looks more and more like iOS every...
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.360]   I mean, Lion is an iOS, is halfway to iOS.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.000]   Well, is that a bad thing?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I mean...
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   No, I'm just pointing out the trend.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.920]   I think it's a bad thing, but I can always use Linux.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.000]   I think it's pointing out the trend.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.320]   I've had a chance now to use a Windows 8 development tablet, and that's a really nice
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   concept.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.960]   The idea of a unified tablet that can run pretty much anything.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.760]   If Microsoft really prosecutes this well and implements it well, that could be a really
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.560]   interesting wake-up call for how a modern operating system should be done.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.920]   The idea that you shouldn't just have this two separate devices for two separate sort
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   of profiles.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.200]   I don't think that it's sort of clumsy that when I travel, oftentimes I'm traveling with
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.760]   my MacBook Pro and my iPad instead of one or the other.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.960]   Well, I use SUSE Air all the time.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.040]   Although I'm sitting in front of a MacBook right now, but that's going to be replaced
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.920]   because it's too damn heavy.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.280]   We are talking with Ken, OS Ken, Mac OS Ken.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.760]   You'd have to change your name.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   You'd have to be...
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   No, I wouldn't.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   People have been asking me for years.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   What do you do when they go to 11 minutes?
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   I've had Ray.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   I'm Ray.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   I'm from many years now.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   Ray Ken.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   Anyway, he is from Mac OS Ken.com.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   He'll keep it.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760]   He'll keep it.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.240]   And he's @Mac OS Ken on Twitter, Andy Inaco from Chicago sometimes.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.600]   And you know, there was a female voice that just emerged.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   I realize that some of you may not know that that is, I mean Rivera, who is the producer
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.480]   of the show, is running the show right now on the control board.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.640]   She's what we call the technical director and is the host of All About Android, which
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   is...
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   I don't care about that in this one.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.920]   She's a spy for Google.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.520]   And I still have an iPhone 4.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520]   Oh, look at that.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   I still have one.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   What are you, Slomin?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   I play around with apps.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   Did you see this?
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520]   We're going to take a break.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520]   But before we do, I just wanted to...
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   Did you see something...
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.520]   The chat room was pointing this out.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   Kickstarter project called The Landing Zone, a docking station for the MacBook Air.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   200 bucks.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.600]   They're only halfway to their goal if you...
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.120]   But they've got a month to go.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.360]   I don't know if I like the idea of a docking station for MacBook Air.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.080]   That just seems silly.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:25.840]   Also, you already have a bunch of different really cool desktop just stands for MacBook
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   Air.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.480]   You plug in one firewire port, you got pretty much everything you want.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.040]   Well, and Thunderbolt, I want to see...
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.200]   Also, this is a bunch of ports too.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.080]   This doesn't have Thunderbolt, and that's the problem.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.560]   And I think what we really want to see is...
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560]   It's all USB 2.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560]   It'll be fine.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560]   It'll be fine.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   It'll be fine.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   This is the future.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   It's the dock of some kind.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.480]   Somebody just plug in there and everything happens magically.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.280]   I do love the way the Mac 20-inch 7-inch monitor hooks up to the laptop with the power supply,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   a USB connector, and a monitor...
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.360]   Or actually, display port, I guess.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.360]   I don't know.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   I guess it'd be Thunderbolt in the going forward.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.920]   Is it Thunderbolt now?
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.680]   The Thunderbolt display is that sort of thing just integrated into a really cool, cinema
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.840]   display where you plug it even if you plug it into an 11-inch air through the Thunderbolt
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   board.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   It's USB, USB, you get...
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   It makes it.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.480]   You get USB, you get gigabit ethernet, you get everything.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   Does it power it?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   No, it doesn't power it.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.280]   So, you still need a power cord.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.440]   I have to rethink that.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.880]   I'm not sure if it gets...
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.560]   I think it needs its own power.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   It probably does.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   It probably does.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.000]   But essentially, you get one connection to your MacBook Air, and you have all these ports
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.960]   and an external display.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   That's awesome.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.280]   And that's why I don't think it's likely that Apple will ever stop doing the iMac.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.960]   But I think that at least gives them the possibility of saying instead of creating a $2,000 iMac
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.720]   and a $900 or an air, we could just simply get rid of the iMac itself.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.080]   And find a way to build this for $799 and say, "Well, this is your iMac now.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   Just dock it."
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   Right.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Super awesome.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   Oh my God.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   It's super.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.680]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.480]   Come back with more with Andy.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   Ken.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.560]   So, as we talk about Apple and the Macintosh and the little iOS and some rumors, too, coming.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.120]   But first, go to meeting.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:24.200]   My good friends at GoToMeeting have really solved a lot of my meeting issues.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.840]   Because we're a distributed company.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.920]   We have 20 people here in Petaluma, but probably 100 people everywhere else all over the place.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.400]   And not to mention all our partners and people we work with.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.120]   I'll tell you, it's hard to get people together for a meeting unless you use something like
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   GoToMeeting.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.720]   And now with the holidays coming, GoToMeeting is really a lifesaver.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.040]   People are going to be traveling and so forth, but you need to have an impromptu meeting.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.280]   You can't get them in the room.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   You use GoToMeeting.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.000]   Try it right now.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.200]   It works not only on a Mac or Windows to hold the meeting, but you can attend the meeting
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:06.360]   on Mac, Windows, iPad, iPhone now, and Android.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.840]   Android phones will just pretend that doesn't happen.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   Android phone.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.240]   At the same time, you can attend meetings on any device.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:19.960]   That means, boy, no matter where you are, you can look at this and by the way, you can't
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.920]   do video from the phone or the iPad yet.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   I'm sure that it's coming, but you can also send video from the desktop, which with this
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.440]   HD faces technology, it is fantastic.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.280]   I want you to visit GoToMeeting.com right now and try it free.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:39.520]   All you need is the offer code I, Mac, break, M-A-C-B-R-E-A-K, and you can try it free for
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.200]   30 days.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.520]   The iPad app is free.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.360]   The iPhone app is free.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.400]   Now you can head out 10 meetings.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.440]   You can hold meetings with a distributed staff with salespeople everywhere.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.200]   You can even say to people, "Hey, it's the holidays.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.800]   Take some time off, but we're going to have that meeting anyway on Wednesday."
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   I like that.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.200]   Use the offer code, Mac, break, and you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.960]   A really great deal and great people too, making a fantastic product.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.360]   It's a Hail Mary pass for AT&T.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.800]   They're losing in the bottom of the ninth.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.880]   It's the not mixing sports now.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.920]   It's the last minute of the fourth quarter and they're down 28-0.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.560]   The FCC, Julian Jannikowski, the chairman of the FCC said, "We're going to send this
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.640]   to an administrative hearing," which I'm told is FCC talk for.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.440]   Not going to happen.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.640]   Department of Justice investigating.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.320]   The AT&T folks pull, this happened last week, pull their FCC applications.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.920]   We don't want to be told no just yet.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.160]   They're restructuring the deal.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.480]   I think they hope to restructure the deal to get it through the Department of Justice,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.280]   even though they're going to take that $4 billion charge, the $3 billion cancellation
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.120]   fee that goes to T-Mobile's owner, Deutsche Telekom, plus a billion dollars in Spectrum,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.320]   which will go to T-Mobile.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.480]   It turns out AT&T is making this deal solely for the Spectrum.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.360]   They're talking about ways to salvage the transaction, including going to a company called
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.920]   Leap Wireless.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.840]   Some of you may have heard their ads.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.960]   Some of these small, a second tier wireless player, they want to sell it T-Mobile's customer
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   accounts.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.720]   Oh, that's great.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.160]   I'm so happy they're going to move me over to Leap Wireless.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.320]   A little bit of the Spectrum, then they'll keep the rest of the Spectrum.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.160]   The idea being maybe this will appease the Department of Justice.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.760]   If we can get by them, maybe we can, it's kind of like when you're playing Skyrim and
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:42.360]   you got to sneak by the dwarf with the big axe, but then there's a dwarf with an even
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.840]   bigger axe at the end of the hall and you're hoping you can get around him, it's not going
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.320]   well for AT&T.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.200]   That's why they took the charge.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.880]   First of all, I'm shocked that the US government has actually stepped in on this, even though
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.200]   it's obvious they should have.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.400]   Do you think there's any hope for AT&T, Ken?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.000]   Do I think they're...
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Saving this deal?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Who knows?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.600]   It seems to me if you already have the DOJ looking into it and saying that they don't
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.880]   really like it and the FCC is saying they don't really like it, whatever AT&T is going to
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.840]   come back with is only going to be just enough to try to get it by.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.320]   It's hard to imagine that Randall Stevenson and the other guys at AT&T are going to go
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.640]   back and say, "They're right.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.880]   What's going to be best for everybody?"
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.040]   They're really only going to give as much as they...
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.320]   I'm sorry, this is horrible to say.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.560]   I'm sure they're wonderful people.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.560]   No, they're not.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   No, they're not.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.920]   They're just going to go and give just...
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.400]   No, they're not.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.040]   The tiniest bit that they can't too squeak this by.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.320]   If it goes by...
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   It seems hard to believe.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.840]   At the same time, it's supposed to be bad news for T-Mobile, except they get the $4 billion
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.920]   or the $3 billion and the spectrum or whatever they get.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.880]   Maybe this is a shot in the arm for T-Mobile.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.040]   My biggest hope, honestly, I used to be with T-Mobile and I loved T-Mobile.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.720]   I'd love it if they got an iPhone.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   Everybody said, "The second Verizon gets an iPhone, I'm going to switch."
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.440]   I had no interest in going to Verizon.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.600]   If T-Mobile got an iPhone, I'd think about going back because they were always great as
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.240]   far as customers sort of as goes.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:20.360]   Summer's saying this whole deal was to weaken T-Mobile, to keep them from getting the iPhone,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.600]   to keep them from winning new customers, just to weaken them.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   It was like they were casting a spell of weakened stamina to AT&T, hoping to kind of beat them.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   I don't know.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.120]   $4 billion, which is just to weaken your competition.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.120]   I know that's...
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.400]   Yeah, and that's just...
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   They're also trying to...
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.400]   This is coming from Andrew Ross Sorkin writing in Deal Book for the New York Times.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.480]   He said, "Actually, the deal...
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.440]   They were advised by their lawyers that there was a 60 to 70 percent chance of success.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.720]   But the risk of losing the deal, according to one participant in an AT&T board meeting,
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.680]   a banker advised the company, "The risk of losing the deal and paying the $4 billion break
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   of fee was worth taking because it would probably distract, sprint, and make T-Mobile
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.200]   a lesser competitor."
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.640]   Even if they lose, which they thought they probably wouldn't.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.760]   They knew there was a fairly significant risk they would.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.480]   They gain by weakening their two competitors.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:33.600]   I'm probably the same position as Ken here, where my personal lack of business acumen on
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.720]   the scale of this sort of deal, prevents me from really understanding it.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.600]   To me, man, my hat's off to the owners of T-Mobile saying, "Okay, if this deal doesn't
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.640]   go through, you still owe us a check for $4 billion."
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.960]   You got to understand, in this world, billions are nothing.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.000]   I'll take half a billion.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.960]   I'll take half of that nothing.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   I'll tell you in here, billion.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.160]   It starts to add up.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.840]   Yeah, I really wish I understood the further dynamics of this deal, where if you can afford
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:10.000]   to write a check for $4 billion, just to distract competitors and make sure that competitors
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   don't get to add T-Mobile to their own stallions and that T-Mobile can't really grow to take
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.840]   any market share away from AT&T, wow, that's a big check to write.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.920]   That instantly makes me take a step back and wonder exactly what's really going on here.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:31.800]   I talked to one friend who has some knowledge of these matters, and he says that he believed
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.720]   at the time, this deal was announced that the only reason why they agreed to the $4 billion
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.000]   kiss-off is that they were that sure that this would go through or that if there were
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.440]   any problems up ahead, they could find a way around them.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.880]   I'm just a spectator with this, just like a lot of people.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.720]   I love Robert Bigelow's comment on our chatroom, "Hey, what about simply providing decent
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.000]   service at reasonable rates to weaken the competition?"
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Never work.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Never work.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Tommy.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.240]   Next, he'll be telling McDonald's to just produce high-quality food, fresh and sourced
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.760]   from local ingredients at a reasonable price.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.000]   It sounds like five guys burgers and fries.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I love them.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.400]   Oh, God, I hate them.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   I hate them.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.840]   You don't like five guys?
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.480]   You have five guys?
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.320]   We have five guys all over these coasts.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   I hate their ones.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.720]   I'll do the 30-second version of this.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.400]   It's just that it's an OK burger.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.720]   It's more fries than medicinally anyone can possibly process in a week.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:35.040]   The big problem is that every five guys I've ever been to and I've only been is lit by
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.240]   constant, like strobe lighting, powerful lights.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   You don't want to go there.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.600]   All the walls are white.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.960]   They're also like white tiles so that every night, like after the soccer team or the baseball
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.200]   team literally comes in there, it's screaming kids, reverberating from all sides.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.680]   And I'm like, "Oh, and I volunteered to be in here."
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.560]   There's a Chipotle, like right across the street where they have that lovely music, a
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.880]   lovely burrito for $7.40.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.760]   I could take half of it home, unlimited drink, refills.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   Why am I here?
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.840]   They're trying to drive you out.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.640]   That's why they don't want you to stay at five guys.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.920]   They want you to get your burger and go.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.320]   Same reason Denny's is like orange and brown or something because they don't want it to
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   look good.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.120]   They want you to move, move, move, move.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.920]   I've explained that guy behind the counter who was like, "How do rubber band and paper
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.120]   clips work firing in my neck?"
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   I was like, "Try to eat."
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   It's not here.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   I didn't understand it.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.520]   I'm not that sort of business acumen on how to keep the table turned over.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.960]   You know, though, after reading Roger Ebert's, I mentioned this last week, Roger Ebert's
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.880]   book, I do want to go to Steak and Shake.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.240]   When I was in Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago, I did a Google search, saying, "Is there
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.720]   a steak and shake anywhere near Milwaukee?"
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.120]   I went from being ecstatic to finding, "Yes, there is one.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   I could go to the Steak and Shake to finding out that, "Oh, no, it closed a year ago.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.640]   Oh, now I'm sad."
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.520]   But there's a treat only just across the street from my hotel.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.520]   I do like Chipotle.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.520]   That's very good.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.320]   I get to say, this is an easy conversation for Leo to have because he's like, "I'm going
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.240]   to be in the house because he's within driving distance of an in-and-out burger."
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   It's true.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   When I am five guys.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.560]   When I am five, every place I actually drove my stuff across the country and every time
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.200]   I saw an in-and-out burger, I stopped because I thought, "This is going to be the last one."
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.480]   I turned up the last one with someplace in Arizona, but then, seriously, my favorite
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.560]   part of the year is January when I go to Macworld and my favorite part of going to Macworld
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.720]   is I go down to Pier 39 for Fisherman's Wharf and go to In-N-Outburn.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.600]   I tried to get my son to go to In-N-Out last night for dinner and he wouldn't.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.520]   I thought, "Oh, this is bad.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   He's finally OD.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.880]   Don't In-N-Out."
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.080]   Apple nicking, nipping or nicking targets heels for the first...
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   Okay.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   Apple.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.840]   Does this ever happen to Dan Benjamin on 5-5?
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.040]   Apple nipping at targets heels for the fourth most visited site on Black Friday.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.800]   The only individual product brand to reach the top ranks among the big box retailers.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.480]   That's how big Black Friday was for Apple.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.960]   Forget Best Buy, Walmart and Amazon, then Apple.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.520]   That's pretty good.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.520]   That's crazy for them.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.720]   They're just selling stuff like crazy.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.040]   Well, I'm just wondering if they sell there, though.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.360]   Was it just visits or was it actually?
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   It just visits.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   It's just visits.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.600]   Yeah, because then a lot of those...
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   A black...
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.560]   According to a report from 9-5 Mac, Apple's Black Friday sales were off the charts.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:26.480]   Blue Away forecasts by 7 p.m. and broke records for their biggest sales day ever.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.600]   Well, that's a different thing, though.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.480]   That's not just the online stores.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   That's the stores.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   That's everything.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.560]   That's also a big deal because they weren't selling $2 Waffle makers.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:42.840]   They were giving you what is kind of like a measly 5 to 10% discount off of really expensive
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   stuff.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.960]   So, I guess when you're used to never paying one penny below full manufacturer's list
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.720]   price on an Apple hardware, the ability to save 50 bucks on an iPad is probably...
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.040]   Or 75 bucks on a MacBook Air is a bigger deal than it would be at Walmart.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.280]   Apple's not notorious for big discount stream Black Friday, but they did what about...
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.080]   It's roughly 10%, right?
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.200]   5 to 10% depending on the product, you know?
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.840]   That's bigger than usual.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   It's still crazy.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.280]   And then all the surveys that are coming out right now that...
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.020]   I think there was one from Piper Jaffrey that just came out yesterday that the top three
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:22.540]   things that kids, teenagers in the US want are cash, clothes, and then Apple gear.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.100]   And the UK, kids want Apple gear here.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.800]   And I think it's the US and the UK combined.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.560]   I mean, it's top of everybody's list.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   It's up for you.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560]   Definitely.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.220]   You're going to go to Apple first whether you end up doing your buying there or not.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.580]   They've also done the whole thing now where they're offering free shipping in the States
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.340]   for anything that you buy through their site, which is kind of cool.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.040]   Although you're still probably... if you're an Amazon Prime member, you're probably...
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.480]   Yeah, they're competing with Amazon.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.320]   75... according to Apple Insider, 75% of Apple's stores sold out of the 4S on Black Friday.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.040]   iPad sales were up 68%.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.760]   Actually, this is from Deutsche Bank.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:07.080]   Chris Whitmore had its analysts check 200 stores on Black Friday to assess the bed for
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:14.160]   Apple products, 100 Apple retail stores, and 100 AT&T Verizon Sprint, Best Buy Walmart,
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   and Target stores.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:21.380]   75% of the stores, the Apple retail stores they pulled were out of iPhone 4S's on Black
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.380]   Friday.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.380]   Apple had restocked by Saturday, however.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.300]   Not a lot of them.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.940]   I think 45, but the 75.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.940]   Right.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   Which...
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.740]   AT&T stores, half of them were sold out over the weekend.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.460]   Piper Jeffery's Gene Munster, who does the same thing, said that iPad sales per hour were
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.140]   68% higher than they were a year ago.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:50.000]   They believe that Apple will have sold 13.5 million iPads in the fourth quarter of December.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   Which is not much above Wall Street, it's expecting.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.800]   General consensus is only 13 million.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:03.240]   Well, it kind of dwarfs the 4 to 5 million that Kindle Fire might sell.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.920]   It does, but the Kindle Fire, I mean, that's...
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.400]   Well, we talked about that already.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.040]   I mean, that they're able to sell that many pretty much sight unseen as kind of stunning.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   And to support...
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.140]   Andy's contention that the Mac is alive and kicking.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.820]   Mac sales, an average of 10.1 max an hour, up 23% from last year.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.780]   They project 5.2 million Macs sold in the holiday quarter.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.540]   So I mean, you know, that's pretty solid.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.820]   I'd take it.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.660]   They like the air.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.260]   The entry level 11 inch air was aided by a 10% discount, the most popular option in
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.380]   the lineup.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.220]   As for the iPad, retail employees indicated consumers tended to be gravitating towards
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.940]   higher capacity models.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.140]   They're not selling the cheapo.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.980]   The most popular model with 32 gigabyte.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.460]   I wonder about 3G versus Wi-Fi, however.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.220]   I want to say that that article indicated that it was the 3G, the 32 gigabyte.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.220]   Interesting.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.460]   Which surprise was spending.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:10.260]   Well, not as much as they would spend on a computer though, which goes back to the whole
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.100]   is that med folk or what's getting hurt by the iPad.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   Right.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.300]   I'd love to see data on the difference between sell through on the through the Apple stores
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.460]   versus other retailers.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.060]   Because I don't mean, I don't even mean this as a joke.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.780]   When you walk into the Apple store, you know, you're not walking out there, spending less
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.580]   than a few hundred bucks.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:34.220]   Whereas I wonder if the if the Walmart consumers or the best buy consumers are the ones who
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.580]   are coming in and saying $550 for this.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.580]   I don't think so.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.820]   Let's see what let's see what this Kindle Fire can do.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   I don't know though.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.740]   Have you seen the new Best Buy ad?
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.260]   The new Best Buy that's all about the fact that they have Apple stuff.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.100]   Yeah, they really want to be an Apple vendor.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.340]   I mean, but I mean, in this time, just that they want to be that there, I mean, that's
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   how they're pitching those right.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.340]   Right.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   So that's by where you go for your televisions and your refrigerators and any kind of smartphone
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.340]   you want to.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.180]   All of those Android devices that I lean love so much.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.220]   You know, all of a sudden they're there.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:09.100]   They're add well, it's on their whole ad campaign, but they've got this ad that is centered entirely
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.100]   around the fact that they've got, you know, the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.940]   I sure hate to be competing against the Apple store though.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.700]   That retail experience is mind boggling.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.260]   The only thing bad about the Apple store is it's always crowded.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.540]   It's always full of people.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.340]   I gotta say to who's granted?
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.420]   I live in, I guess, what you would kindly refer to as the second tier city in Buffalo.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:42.380]   I'm kind of wondering who is keeping an eye on Apple retail at this point down because
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.580]   I don't want to complain about the store.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.660]   The staff is generally speaking pretty good.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:53.540]   It's looking a little knackered, as the Brits might say.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.260]   They have a little down.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.900]   Did you see this app that they have the spot, the shopper technology?
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.700]   This is from the Brian Chen, writing in the New York Times Bits blog.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.900]   It's an application only available internally that runs on touches.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.780]   They show the in-store location of the shoppers who have come to pick up something.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:20.460]   I guess what happens is you use the Apple store app yourself as the buy-ee or buy-ir,
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.500]   the buy-ir.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.180]   And then the app will show you and you think, okay.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:32.220]   They're not tracking you, but if any device that you might be in front of and in the Apple
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.100]   store, you can basically say, "Hi, I need to talk to somebody."
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:39.900]   And then it knows that you're on just like a casino where Robert De Niro is saying, "You
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.940]   need a lecture shot at this cheater at Blackjack 3/3 base.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.860]   They know exactly which seat to go to to talk to you."
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.620]   But they're doing a much better job on crowd control.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:56.740]   I was amazed a month or two ago when I finally had the back cover of my iPhone 4 which had
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.100]   a crack and it finally got that replaced.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:05.060]   And I'm used to waiting to go to the actual Genius bar sitting in front of the bar and
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.420]   waiting my turn.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.900]   Really as soon as I came in, I was approached by concierge number one who sort of checked
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.380]   me in, got to the area of the Genius bar, was checked in by concierge number two.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.620]   I was sitting at one of those little workstations, just assuming that I'd be waiting my turn,
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.340]   but no someone came from the back to approach me because I knew that this person has a very
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.420]   simple problem that could be fixed in about 50 minutes.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.860]   Let's dispatch a guy out there right now to basically, instead of him tying up one of
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.420]   the conversational units at the Genius bar, we'll just do the, we'll hand this over to
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.460]   the person that we keep in the back who is not quite so cosmetically perfect, who knows
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.260]   how to deal with the iPhone extraction tool.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.780]   So, it was amazing.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.580]   It was like getting a weighted table service.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.780]   It's pretty amazing it is.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.620]   I think they're very smart in how they're handling, but there is a negative and they're
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.220]   so successful they have been jammed and that might be, I think that might scare people
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   away.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.220]   So, they need to handle people efficiently.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.420]   I think there's Apple app, this app store out.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.900]   So, as long as people go out, I think they've had the same consistent approach since they
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   open the Apple store.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.020]   They want to make sure that if you go into the Apple store, you have a good experience
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.020]   when you come out.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.020]   Right.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.740]   So, you would think that, oh, the fact that the store is jammed would totally screw up
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:19.100]   my experience, but they were so good at maintaining that flow that I had really, the fact that
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:24.820]   it just seemed busy more than it didn't trouble me, it troubled the staff.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.540]   And the fact that they were so jammed up didn't affect my experience at all.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:34.020]   I think I had an appointment for like 315 and I was served by 305, 310 and I was out of
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.740]   there by 325.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.740]   So.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:45.260]   A study from a research firm called GFK says that 84% of current iPhone owners plan to
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.620]   purchase another Apple phone when they replace this cellphone.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.380]   Very high retention rate.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.460]   They did 4,500 interviews with iPhone owners all over the world.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:01.820]   Actually, smartphone owners all over the world and iPhone had 84% Android, 60% Blackberry,
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820]   48%.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:10.180]   You know, it's not an interesting article today that Blackberry, I don't know if this is a
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:16.540]   indicator or not, but Blackberry is going to start expanding their business.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.580]   They have software for managing Blackberries.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.740]   They're going to expand that to include iPhone and Android phone.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.380]   I wonder if RAM is starting to think, maybe this hardware thing isn't working out so well
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.380]   for us.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:34.540]   We should focus on what we do best, which is enterprise secure enterprise mobile platform.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.380]   Wouldn't that be weird if they just got out of the phone?
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.340]   You know, I've seen a strategy.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.500]   We should focus on what we do best.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.940]   Assigning an emergency action team to bring our servers back online after a worldwide
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.940]   service.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.940]   Oh my God.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   All right, we got some rumors.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.660]   We got lots of rumors.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.340]   Mark Millian, did you see he wrote a, we're going to get to those in just a second, but
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.900]   a couple of real quick shorties before we take our next break.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.580]   Mark Millian, who has been on the show many times, he used to write for the LA Times.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.660]   He's now at CNN.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:10.020]   He has an e-book that is called Letters to Steve inside the email inbox of Apple Steve
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.020]   Jobs.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.900]   $2.99 on the Kindle.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.820]   It's 67 pages.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.100]   He says he reviewed more than 100 emails allegedly sent by jobs.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.620]   The problem is it's very difficult to know, including some never before published notes
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.180]   that were shared exclusively for the new title.
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.420]   Interviews with some of the customers and people that jobs communicated with.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:36.380]   Wow, this is going to become, I think it's a cottage industry going forward.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.020]   Steve Jobs is cottage industry of books about Steve Jobs.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.740]   Did you, have you been following?
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.060]   I know you probably have Andy because you do a show for five by five.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.940]   I listened to John Syracuse's hyper critical.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:55.980]   A couple of episodes 42 and 43, just panning Isaacson's book about jobs.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:01.100]   I mean, just saying, basically the fundamental point was Steve picked the wrong guy to write
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.100]   his biography.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.540]   This guy knew nothing about the technology, knew nothing about Apple, knew nothing about
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.100]   the industry.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.500]   He was just a business reporter.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:14.300]   And so as a result, not only did he make a lot of mistakes, but the book is missing what
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:20.420]   Syracuse have felt it needed, which was a deep analysis of what happened at Apple and
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.740]   what Steve did.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:25.740]   Dave Weiner weighed in to agree.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.940]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.820]   I think the book is great for what it is, which is a book that was written during the
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.140]   biography that was written during the subject's lifetime.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.900]   It doesn't matter how firmly the word gets out that, hey, you might be here from this
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.300]   Isaacson guy.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.660]   I've told him that he can have full access to anybody.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.420]   Feel free to say whatever you want.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:51.260]   But I don't think that will still limit what a person says about the subject.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.260]   I agree.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.060]   Especially given, I hope that he's put this delicately, if you know this person is very,
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.700]   very sick and probably will not live to see the publication of this book, do you want
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.660]   to be the person who says, oh, that guy, he was such a dill weed.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.220]   I can't get over how mean he was.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:11.060]   I'm so glad the day I walked out Apple for good is the best day of my life.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:18.180]   So you really do need a number of years to find out what the true long range effects
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.180]   of certain decisions and strategies are.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.940]   He was denied that opportunity.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:27.420]   Thirdly, you sort of deny people the ability to do.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.700]   One of the things that Dave Liner was, and also Dan Gilmore, who is a very, very good
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.180]   journalist and also someone who writes about journalism for a number of different outlets,
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:44.300]   complaining that Isaacson was told about a lot of Apple's future plans, but decided
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.700]   not to publish them because he felt that that would be unfair to the company, that
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.460]   he wasn't writing a business book to give Samsung and all their competitors an advanced
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   look at what they were doing.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.300]   I believe Isaacson himself admitted that.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.060]   So I don't think it's a great explanation.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.460]   Well, that's why it got out.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.500]   So if this book had been published 10 years from now, everything that he had been planning
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.820]   and all the business moves that Steve Jobs have been making would already be moot and
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.620]   people would now be free to talk about those things from both sides of the fence.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.540]   So I agree and I disagree with John.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:19.700]   I do think that it isn't the definitive biography like that is not on the same level as the
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:25.540]   biographies of Ben Franklin and Einstein that I just had written before.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.860]   But I think that at least he has now that library and that database of interviews so
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.140]   that if 10 years from now he wants to write that more definitive book or if he just simply
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.300]   wants to donate these interviews to a university library.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.300]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.300]   Yeah, that's that's my hope.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.860]   There are 40 interviews that must spend hundreds of hours and that is the primary source.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.620]   And I do if he, this is what I wrote to Dave.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.380]   I said, Dave, all I say is we should start a campaign is tell to tell Isaacson, please
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.740]   we beg of you, maybe on your death, it's fine.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.700]   But at some point, please donate these interviews so that future historians have this as a primary
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.500]   resource resource along with interviews that, you know, other interviews and so forth.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.220]   There's a lot of material about Apple.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.580]   I think the better the best biographies are yet to be written, of course.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.740]   That's that's pretty much par for the course on any historical book.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.420]   There's so many, there's so many sets of papers that are locked in vaults by, by seal
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.460]   of, of, of someone's last one won't test them or the seals of their estate saying that I
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:27.140]   will, I will tell you exactly what I, what I was up to.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.580]   What my, what my thought process were on the day of Jay of Kays assassination, but not until
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.180]   50 years after I'm done.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.140]   So sometimes, sometimes there are books that serve, that serve the mass market and sometimes
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.660]   there are books that serve history.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.500]   I don't think this is the book that was designed to serve history, but it's still a very, very
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   great.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500]   It's great to read.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.060]   It's still the best insight we've gotten into this person that we've known of, but not
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.980]   known about for the past 30, 40 years.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.980]   You agree, Ken?
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.260]   Yeah, I was going to say it's a, it's kind of like an airplane book, right?
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.260]   I mean, this is for everybody.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.180]   Yeah, this is a very long flight.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.900]   Well, yeah, but I mean, I'll be honest, I read very slowly.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.940]   I'm only about halfway through it because I read before I could have bad until I usually
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.940]   fall asleep reading it.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.540]   But I mean, I can say it's audible, audible, okay.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.540]   We get it.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540]   All right.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540]   Well, it's a great audiobook.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.340]   You're not allowed to fall asleep when you're driving.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:22.860]   We're going to, we go in the book very quickly from we're in Steve Jobs garage to, he's,
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.060]   he's, you know, meeting with the board in the building.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.180]   And I kind of wanted to go back and see, did I miss like, did I skip a chapter accidentally?
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:34.300]   I mean, this is a, this is a very quick run through a lot of things that, you know, as
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.980]   Apple geeks or as Matt Geeks or as just technology geeks or Silicon Valley geeks, you want a
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.940]   lot more information about, you know, how did, how did, how did this happen?
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.940]   Right.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.940]   When did they build the building?
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.060]   How did, I mean, at what point did they say, you know, the garage is getting a little
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.300]   tight.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.780]   We don't get that kind of detail, but at the same time, I mean, he's covering a ton
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.540]   of stuff and this is, I mean, this is a Christmas, well, not a Christmas release because it came
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540]   out in October.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.620]   I mean, this is a general consumer release as Andy said.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.180]   I mean, so there's a lot of really neat stuff about it.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.620]   He started in the garage and here's Pixar and George Lucas, you know, screwed up when
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   he sold big.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.620]   Sorry.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.620]   Oh, I mean, it's, it's, I mean, it's a Hollywood tale.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.340]   And a lot of ways where, how would a Silicon Valley?
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:19.460]   As Sir Cusa pointed out, the, the, the first few years of Apple was so heavily covered,
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:25.540]   the 50 books plus Michael Malone's excellent book and on and on that that I felt like
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.940]   Isaac's in skim through that is a prelude.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.940]   And I think you're right.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.460]   This was written for the general public.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:34.140]   So here's, so you know, here's the setup and really you're going to get to the good
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.140]   parts can are still to come the, the kind of behind the scenes on antenna gate and,
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.460]   you know, some insights.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.740]   We got a lot of insight into jobs that I, I don't think I'd ever read anywhere else.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:48.460]   I know John's probably, Sir Cusa's probably read more books about Apple than anybody,
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.580]   but I think there was plenty in there to make it worthwhile.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.420]   And I hope there's more to come.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.900]   You know, Andrew Sorkin, I'm sorry, Aaron Sorkin, Andrew's the business writer.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:04.620]   Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, is considering writing this screenplay for a Steve Jobs movie.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.820]   Sony apparently quoting him movie based on the book.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.620]   Sorkin of course wrote the West Wing.
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.100]   He wrote the social network.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.100]   Here's a guy, he used to go focuses on facts.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:19.180]   He's really upset that Apple didn't actually build that circular campus building like while
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.860]   Steve Jobs was alive because that would allow him to do like the entire movie as just one
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:27.700]   long walk and talk of Steve just walking, talking to underlings to come in and out.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.700]   Yes, no, yes.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.340]   They come back to the starting point.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.100]   They just keep going laps, laps, laps.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.300]   It'd be perfect for that.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300]   It's a bio.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.700]   So please, by the time it's made, he will have built it.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.500]   He will have seen it built and that'll be fine.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.900]   You just put him in there.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.700]   It was just, you know, it's a little fictional.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   I hope that happens.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.700]   I love, I mean, there, there's a lot of backlash immediately that said, Aaron Sorkin's the
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.300]   wrong person to do this.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.780]   He doesn't understand tech.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.900]   He doesn't understand business.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.300]   He understands how to sell tickets.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.620]   And he writes amazing dialogue.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.700]   He does kind of hate, he hates the internet though and he hates technology.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   He's pretty apparent in all of his writing, you know.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.700]   Bloggers are always underage snotty-nose kids and their jammies in the basement and
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.420]   all of his TV shows.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:15.980]   And you know, even the, even the portrayal, portrayal of Zuckerberg was I think kind of
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.300]   a little mean, but hey, you're right.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.220]   It'll be a great movie and it won't, it'll be much like this Isaacson book.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:29.300]   It may not be the perfect story of what really happened, but neither was Amadeus, but it
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.300]   was a great movie.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   Exactly.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.860]   I mean, it's okay to say that we're, you know, it's okay to say that we're just going
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:39.220]   to do a two and a half hour movie that's interesting entertaining that will not, will
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.620]   be based on fact, but not necessarily the facts.
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:48.700]   And then when we think about what, what, what other tech guy is better suited for two
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:53.500]   hours, two and a half hours of entertainment, be of so many set pieces that are just purely
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500]   visual.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.140]   All you have to do is do an establishing shot of Steve Jobs inside his mansion that looks
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.940]   like he's basically a squadron.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.860]   He pulled in like a mattress we found on the curb somewhere and a, and a, and a, and a,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:08.100]   and a, and a really good expensive chair that his grandfather left him when he died.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.300]   And then this is this guy who controls this huge company with surrounded by practically
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:17.340]   nothing, then you understand so much about how, what makes this guy tick.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:22.380]   You get, you, you get into this, this, these other figures who are like, no, he's got,
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.620]   well, he's got a couple action figures and he's got a couple comics on the, on the nightstand
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.860]   and a couple of empty soda can't hit.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:33.380]   That's, that's like, that's like almost 73% of anybody between the age of 25 and 43 who
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.940]   knows a little bit of Pearl.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.060]   How much, how much more interesting is this movie going to be than the, the social network?
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.340]   I mean, this, I mean, this is dramatic.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.340]   And you've got it.
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:48.500]   You got a central character that is operatic in his mood swings and, and his genius.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.780]   And I mean, it's, I want to see Steve Jobs the opera.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.500]   The, the, the, exactly.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   You could do that.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:59.420]   Zuckerberg's as, as you must have rounded corners.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.420]   This is.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:07.220]   I, I almost launched into a song that would have gotten us the explicit tag, but.
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   This is crap.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.420]   I think you all know that this is crap.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   You're a jerk.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   Get your stuff.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.420]   You are gone.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.380]   I'll talk to you to defend your defend your system.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.980]   I don't think you can do what I want the company to do.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.220]   And that's the Broadway musical.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   Let's see if Jobs the Broadway musical.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.220]   I'll come know and choose my thing.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   You should be that.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.700]   This is like, this is good.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.380]   I hope somebody's taking another spill on the floor for someone else to pick up.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:37.140]   I was going to say it's obvious you've been working on this for quite a while.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.620]   No, no, you don't know, Andy.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.940]   His best work is just by boom, right over the top of his head.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.260]   That's what I got.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:49.020]   I got Dr. Andy's magic thinking juice in this job.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.140]   Steve Jobs exhibit on display at the US Patent Office Museum.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:57.500]   This looks some like really cool, the US Patent and Trademark Office opened an exhibit in its
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.060]   Alexandria, Virginia offices.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:07.820]   It's in the atrium of the headquarters and it's 30 giant iPhone like display panels,
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:13.540]   most of which display the front pages of the over 300 patent and trademark filings that
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.020]   bear Steve Jobs name.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:21.820]   I think that is a tribute that Steve would have loved.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.700]   It's amazing that it only took them a month and a half to do it.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   I'm just kidding.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.700]   It's not just something to me.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.140]   I mean, you hear they applied for this patent in 1996 and it was released this past week.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.580]   And then I hear a month or month and a half.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:37.140]   They've already got the immemorial up and I'm kind of like, wow, that's so fast.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   Don't you guys have something else to do?
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.140]   No, no, no, no, not at all.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   I'm amazed.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.540]   I'm wondering if maybe they'd go, you know, if we were able to do that so quickly.
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.540]   Just that.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:51.860]   The US Patent Office took a break away from its usual mandate of crushing innovation and
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.620]   enhancing open technologies in order to put up a whole bunch of really wicked, cool,
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:56.620]   jumbo iPhones.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.620]   We took the taxpayers and Joe.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.860]   Oh, you're in rare form today.
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.020]   Andy Inaco is here.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:10.900]   He is also the host of a great podcast audio only called Andy Inaco's Almanac.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.300]   Do you not go Almanac?
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:17.460]   Do you not go Almanac on the five by five network at five by five.tv.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:24.020]   And I'm not going to talk about you and Marco, but I just I just hope it all works out.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.020]   We're building it.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.020]   We're rebuilding brick by brick step by step.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.020]   They're in there.
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.020]   We'll get back to where we once were.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:33.580]   We're just we're both willing to work and that's really all you need.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.100]   And of course, Mac OS can is here.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:41.940]   Mac OS can come for his daily podcast of tech news right there on the web.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.100]   It's a great podcast.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.740]   But these are all podcasters here.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.380]   A bunch of podcasters.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.780]   We're going to get to our rumor segment.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.260]   We did one rumor, but there's still plenty more.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:56.700]   This is the time of year when the rumors go crazy, but first I'd like to talk a little
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.580]   bit about my Mustang.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:05.820]   Ford.com/technology is the place to go to find out more about all the amazing technology
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.540]   Ford is building into its automobiles.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.980]   My next I got to tell you my next vehicle is going to be the all electric Ford focus.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.500]   I cannot wait.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.500]   It's coming.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.260]   It's maybe a few months off, but you can take a look at the 2012 focus right now with
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.420]   the sink and my Ford touch and just the things that this can do.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.340]   You got the in the center console.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.620]   This big I would as an eight inch seven inch display.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.100]   You got two of the screens to behind the steering wheel and you can control everything with
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.100]   your voice.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.900]   The whole point of all of this is safety first.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.100]   Hands on the wheel eyes on the road, but you press the button on the wheel and you can
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.260]   pick a song.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.540]   We've talked about this before.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.780]   You can set the cabin temperature ask for the nearest gas station, but I think it's
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   really important to underscore the GPS.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.100]   We don't talk about that.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.780]   It's fantastic in this thing.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.700]   They've got 40 million businesses built in.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.500]   You can ask for something by business and it will not only have directions to the business
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   and drive you there.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.340]   It also has the telephone number.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.580]   You can say call that business.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.220]   You can use a send they've ascended to sync feature, which lets you on your desktop use
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.100]   Google Maps or MapQuest to plan a trip.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.780]   This is nice if you have multiple stops and you want to do an elaborate trip, maybe over
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.460]   the river and through the woods to grandmother's house.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:19.580]   You do it on your desktop, save it to your website, your sync traffic directions and information
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.500]   systems account and then use voice commands in your vehicle to get those term to fetch
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.420]   the term by turn directions.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.500]   Or even they even have a free mobile app for your iPhone.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.180]   I'm an Android phone.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.180]   We'll say that.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.260]   That lets you get that information on the go.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.300]   I have traffic conditions sent to your mobile phone and more.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   If you go to Ford.com/technology, you'll see an overview of all the wonderful technologies
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.740]   they're building into today's 21st century Ford vehicles.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.820]   They are really the most forward looking car company.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:54.140]   The best way to try this, go to your Ford dealer and try that 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.420]   You're going to love it.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.420]   Give it a try today.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.180]   Drive one today, Ford.com/technology.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.900]   We thank them so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:10.220]   I just thought that Slacker now is part of the App Link package because they talk, you
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.940]   can talk to your smartphone.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.580]   Now you got Stitcher, Slacker, Pandora and OpenBeak.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:21.300]   There really is more and more apps all the time.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.340]   Before we get to the rumors, one more thing.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.820]   I saw an iPod touch ad the other day.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:31.700]   It's really interesting to look at Apple's positioning of the touch.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.940]   They're going after kids, teenagers, preteens, kids you may not give an iPhone to but who
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:42.140]   want those apps or demand those apps would be using Wi-Fi, not 3G, a lot more affordable.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.940]   They're really focusing on the youth market.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.500]   This is the first time I can remember Apple doing this.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.860]   Of course, their iPod ads.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.860]   There we go.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.420]   Want to play?
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:57.900]   These are, remember, these look like they're 17 or 18, but that means it's aimed at a 14-year-old.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.900]   13-year-old.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.420]   Those are younger kids.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.980]   What are they saying here?
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.300]   Parents aren't going to buy iPhones for kids this young.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.340]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:17.260]   Well, iPod touch has always been a really popular solution for, as a parent, to buy kids,
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.220]   not only because you delete the phone features, but also because you lose a monthly contract.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.500]   It's the last PDA.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:28.620]   Yeah, it's the last company still selling PDAs.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:34.140]   What a great entry-level drug to get kids into the iPhone space.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:39.740]   I doubt there, but I don't notice in the past years you would have seen ads for the iPod
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.500]   and the Nano, but now it's the touch.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.940]   That's the sweet spot, isn't it?
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:51.100]   Also, because, oftentimes, parents get their kids' phones that are on a family plan.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:57.700]   They're not really willing to necessarily buy them a real smartphone as part of the
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   family plan.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.860]   They'll take the deal where they get X number of phones for $29.99.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.060]   They're decent phones, but they're not great phones.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:09.340]   There's a gap there for Apple to exploit to say that, yes, you will get this simple flip
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.380]   phone or this simple touchscreen phone with a camera and a Facebook app that will be your
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.700]   cell phone, but for real apps and for real fun, I think you're going to be turning to
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:17.700]   the Apple logo.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:23.700]   You raise an interesting point, actually, in that paper, Jeffery, thing we were talking
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.660]   about earlier, where 11% of kids want Apple stuff.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:34.460]   If you break down the list, it's talking about generic iPod turns up before iPod touch
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460]   on the list.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   Interesting.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.660]   So nobody's saying, "I want a Nano or I want a shuffle or I want a classic."
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.460]   They're saying iPod, and then the next thing down is an iPod touch.
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.100]   So it makes sense that an Apple would push them that because, like you say, get them
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:48.100]   in while they're young.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.660]   Start with apps when they're 14, 15, and 16.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.540]   I think kids want to get their own smartphone.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.180]   I think kids, they want the games.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:01.580]   They want to play the games that Angry Birds or I guess kids don't play Angry Birds.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580]   What is there?
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.660]   There's that flying game.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.780]   The kids are all the kids are playing where the birds flying around.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.780]   Angry Birds?
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.220]   No, not Angry Birds.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.220]   It's Tiny Wings?
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   Tiny Wings.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   That's the kids love Tiny Wings.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.900]   And there's iMessage because of iMessage, they context.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.260]   So they're not left out.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.540]   It's really interesting way to get them right in there.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.500]   It goes, "Why are they going to advertise the Nano to get it?"
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.980]   That doesn't hook anybody in.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.860]   It might be a gateway drug, but it's not the same gateway drug or Trojan horse that iOS
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.260]   device is because then, you know, hold on to that application forever.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.820]   It's actually time for you to make your own decision about where you're going to go.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.860]   All your stuff's already here, so don't go on.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   Uh-huh.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   All right.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   Rumors.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.860]   Let me have a bumper.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   Go.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.860]   Bumper.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.860]   Okay.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.860]   Sorry.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.860]   I made that.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   I'm not thinking of that stuff.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.860]   That's good.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   Rumor has it.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.860]   The rumor has it.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.860]   There will be 3D iPads.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.860]   Oh, gangmy with a spoon.
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   They're already, well, they're pretty thin, but they're already 3D.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.900]   Would you buy a 3D?
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.620]   Remember the Nintendo 3DS?
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:20.020]   The 3D gaming device using the lenticular 3D, so you didn't need glasses.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.460]   You just had to have your head in the exacting the right spot.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:32.040]   According to Business Insider, Apple decided to nix plans for an Apple iPad 3 with 3D over
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.940]   concerns that the device could become a gimmick.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.940]   No, you think?
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:39.020]   So, um, I don't know.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.780]   Is there a market for 3D?
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.900]   You see 3D phones.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.300]   Uh, I just, you see 3D laptops now.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.540]   You know, you see them at the mobile world congress.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.740]   You don't see them in the world.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.740]   I do.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.740]   You know what?
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.500]   There's a number of people who've come in here and you can tell it's a 3D phone because
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   the camera has two little lenses.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   Yeah, but yeah.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   They hate it.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   Everybody hates it.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:04.860]   But, but I just saw a TV ad for, was it a Toshiba 3D Toshiba laptop?
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   I know.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.540]   I can't imagine there's a market for any of this.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.540]   I hate it.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.540]   I hate 3D.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.100]   But I'm kind of the 3D naysayer.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.220]   So I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:19.180]   I believe this is the, I believe this is a website entering the enterprise market saying
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.220]   that what market are we not touching?
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   I know.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.500]   Well, but we don't want to compete with the, we don't want to compete with the, with the
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.820]   retina display iPad rumor market.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.780]   Let's create a brand new market.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:30.780]   Really stupid 3D.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.500]   It is a crowded market.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.940]   When you talk about Apple suppliers.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.780]   This is green.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:41.420]   It's a carnal Kim and Mac rumors saying apples, suppliers are starting to ship four inch screens
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   for the next iPhone.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:48.820]   According to Asian source Hitachi's display, limited in Sony mobile display corporation,
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:55.700]   started to ship four inch LCDs with the new iOS devices and LCDs for iPad threes.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:56.700]   Okay.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.460]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.940]   Did the original, did the original port say that it was for a four inch iPhone or did
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.620]   it say it was for an iOS device?
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.100]   Oh, because I still have a problem believing in the four inch iPhone.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:11.100]   I mean, if they're actually shipping them something, then maybe something's coming, but
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.940]   I still have a hard time buying the four inch iPhone.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.940]   Really?
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.940]   Yeah, but buying it.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.980]   You think they're going to stay with three and a half inches?
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.060]   Well, I mean, it's that whole thing that we were talking about about the applications,
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.060]   right?
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.060]   I mean, don't screw up something.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:25.780]   If you, if you, right, I mean, it's, I don't know, I'm hard to believe.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.860]   I think if people want to, but you know, Apple is going to.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:34.580]   I have to tell you, I have to tell you consumers want these big screens.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.460]   They want four inches is still too small.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.220]   They want four point three, four point five, four point six.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.660]   They are selling like hotcakes.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.860]   Those are all the Android phones.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.900]   You saw that Samsung commercial slamming eye fans.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.420]   Did you see that with it?
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.820]   All the fanboys are in line behind the bar.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:49.820]   That's a great commercial.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.820]   I loved it.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.180]   But they're all looking and they say, well, that's a big screen.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.540]   And I really do think that the market's moving towards big screens and it is the retina.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:01.260]   You know, I don't know if you could say the retina, the retina display has as many dots,
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.260]   but it's in a little screen.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.260]   I don't know if that's compelling.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:09.020]   I think that Apple's public answer to that question about when they're going to have a
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.180]   larger screen for this.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.740]   They'll say, well, the feature of having a larger screen is to make it easier to read.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.620]   And this is already the best that this is already super easy to read because we packed
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.020]   so much to definition this is.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.620]   It's not taken from a 40 plus year old person.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620]   Yes.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.740]   But I think that if they make that change as more as mostly going to be because of the
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.700]   fact that so many display component manufacturers are making these foreign displays and it might
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:37.860]   become less expensive for them to simply find an existing display if they really, really
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:43.420]   like and hook onto that rather than have to be one of the few a few copies west of source
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.940]   rather odd what might what might become someday a rather odd ball looking component.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.220]   I think they're caught between a rock and a hard place because I think you're right,
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.100]   Ken, that the developers makes a problem for developers.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.300]   If you change the, I guess you could do a foreign display with the same resolution that
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.620]   it wouldn't matter.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.780]   It's resolution that size that matters.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   Okay.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.580]   See that's I mean, that's something that I've always had a question about and I don't honestly
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.300]   don't know the developers point of view its thoughts that they don't care about how many
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:13.940]   if it's four inches worth as long as the same dots you develop for that resolution.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.300]   Maybe, but that doesn't.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.460]   See, here's the other thing though when you say what consumers want is this bigger screen.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.060]   There's a story out of the UK.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:28.940]   It was in the Times online and I cannot remember which firm it was, but there was some firm
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:36.620]   that said that Apple sales of smartphones in the UK after the release of the iPhone 4S
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:42.740]   were something like 42.3% of all smartphones sold in the month of October or iPhones.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.820]   So you can't say that what people want is bigger screens because you keep going for
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.500]   more iPhones when there are more iPhones.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.740]   I have no doubt that people who don't want an iPhone want a larger screen.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.620]   I don't think all of them do, but some of them do.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.860]   I don't think the larger screen is what's driving the smartphone space because you get
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.980]   the iPhone 4S.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:06.100]   You get record sale from Verizon and AT&T on the weekend that the iPhone 4S comes out.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.060]   I don't think people were crossing their fingers hoping it was going to be a 4-inch screen.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.180]   I think they wanted the next iPhone.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:15.100]   So it's not a huge different fader at this point.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.060]   And so then it's hard for me to see why Apple would want to change it.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.420]   Now Andy's point isn't an interesting one.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.620]   If it suddenly becomes cheaper to make a 4-inch screen than a 3.5-inch screen, Tim Colts,
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.980]   a smart guy, and he would want to do something that's going to let it ensure $620 per phone
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.420]   that costs less for him to make.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.700]   But I don't know.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.820]   It's hard to see them changing it just because some people want an Android that has a bigger
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.860]   screen to me.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   I don't know.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.780]   I think people do want bigger screens.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.180]   I think they're willing to give up bigger screens to get an iPhone.
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.580]   But yeah, that's true.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.940]   I mean, it's a different sort of metric when you have one manufacturer making one phone
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:56.980]   take it or leave it.
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:01.220]   I don't think that if there's somebody who would much rather have an Android phone because
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.900]   of the larger screen, they were probably not really locked into the idea of getting an
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.220]   iPhone to begin with.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.140]   I think there are way more advantages to, excuse me, I'm sorry, from my perspective,
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:15.300]   the size of the screen is not the reason why I'm using an iPhone over an Android device.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:21.380]   I do think that Apple should at least look at it because I think that there's a larger
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:26.140]   screen is a nice sort of happy medium between a device that is rather emphatically a phone
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:30.740]   and a device that is sort of a hybrid between a tablet and a phone.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.660]   A larger screen is nicer for reading, obviously.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:38.140]   It means you can actually use it to take Android notes and video.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.020]   But that's not a slam dunk.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.860]   You still have to really articulate that feature well to take advantage of a larger screen.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:50.380]   So it's a difference between on Android, you really can seek out and purchase exactly
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.980]   the device you want.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.900]   And that's why there's so much room for someone to say, well, if people are buying foreign
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.580]   screens, we're going to build the device with a 4 1/2 screen.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.660]   Well, now they're building a 4 1/2 screen.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.900]   We'll build one with a 5-inch screen and see how big we can make it before someone
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.740]   says, oh my God, you people are idiots.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   You don't understand the pockets about this size.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.940]   And now you're making me carry a purse for my phone.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.100]   Well, I agree.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.340]   You can get too big.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.660]   The other thing is, I think that Apple could split the difference by making a bigger screen
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.660]   with the same resolution.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.180]   You don't fragment the market, but you satisfy this need for a bigger screen.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:27.180]   Remember, the iPhone is $660 by $660.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.140]   This new Galaxy Nexus is 1280 by 720.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:37.460]   I mean, we're talking about a significant amount of more real estate.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:46.900]   And I think that as phones become kind of our primary computing platform, more and more
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.340]   primary in the sense that we use it more than we use anything else.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.300]   I think you're going to want more real estate, aren't you?
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.140]   If it means, I don't think it's so much the ability to actually watch HD movies and HD
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.740]   resolution on your phone.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.500]   I think it really is a case of being able to use a Sansa Rift font and actually be able
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.900]   to see the syriffs.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.900]   That if you can get a foreign screen in which you have something that looks more like a
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.780]   printed page and not more like an accommodation of trying to get as good a details for this
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:19.740]   webpage or this magazine content as you can on a small device, then I think that the advantages
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.540]   of larger display become apparent.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.420]   I really don't think it's about user interface.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.220]   I really don't think it's about video or games.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:29.420]   I really do think it's about the simple things of having a user interface that was designed,
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.100]   at least with a potential of looking pretty.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:38.180]   If you had Android 2.1, you can add more pixels and now you're basically adding more
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.340]   garbage to the vacant lot next to your house.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.740]   It's more, it's not better, it's just more.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.220]   So you're looking at changing the phone to me, though, aside from changing the form factor
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.140]   that we already have, looking at changing the phone to me is going the wrong direction.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.300]   I think it would be going the wrong direction as far as Apple is concerned too, not that
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.060]   I'm there, not that I know for certain, but what they're building is an ecosystem.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:03.620]   To say, well, people on bigger phones is to say, well, we are actually concentrating
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.860]   on this device rather than concentrating on the whole.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.860]   Do you see what I mean?
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:13.460]   I think the better case for Apple is, okay, how do we get, it's the whole iCloud thing.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.460]   It's the whole ecosystem thing.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.780]   It's the whole AirPlay thing.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:18.900]   It's the whole making everything play nice together.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.660]   If I'm trying to find a way to make my phone a better way for people to do everything that
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.340]   they want to do, well, then I'm kind of losing because I'm not figuring out how I'm going
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.940]   to push it to the Mac, how I'm going to push it to the iPad, how I'm going to push it to
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.380]   the television, how I'm going to push it to whatever the thing is that I'm going to come
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.940]   out with the next couple of years that nobody even knows about yet except for Walter Isaac.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.540]   Somebody won't tell anybody, damn it.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.340]   Well, I do think that Apple's actually going to have a little bit of a problem because I
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:45.740]   think they are primarily, thanks to Steve, a hardware company and the cloud is baffling
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.500]   them to date.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   Mobile Me was a horrendous experience and I'm not impressed with iCloud yet.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.380]   Yeah, but we're not done.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:57.420]   We're not done, but they haven't shown a mastery of this space in the way that they've shown
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.260]   a mastery of the hardware space.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.740]   And I think that could be a problem going forward, to be honest, as the cloud becomes
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.740]   important.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:10.300]   They do and apparently they are trying to hire some cloud executives as we have the story
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   here.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:17.860]   Apple looking for more senior executives to help run iCloud says Cult of Mac.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.260]   I think that don't you think iCloud is right now?
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.660]   Like what?
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.180]   I think there are parts where that work really well and parts of it.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.900]   I think most of the difficulties, at least I've been having with iCloud, are just ones
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:35.420]   of simple perception where they're not really huge problems with the service itself, but
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.860]   it wasn't working the way that I assumed it would work or the way that the interface
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.260]   kind of hinted at me that would work.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.020]   Most of the problems are things that could have been solved with a really good five minute
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:50.380]   video on apple.com that would automatically load up is, okay, welcome to iCloud.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.460]   Here's what you can expect and here's what it's supposed to do.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:56.460]   Here's what this is not, so don't try to expect that it's going to be unlimited documents
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.620]   thinking on all devices.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:02.260]   That said, there were a whole bunch of glitches that I'm still trying to figure out.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:06.260]   iTunes Match is a really good feature, but I still can't figure out why a lot of my smart
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.260]   playlists aren't coming through the way that they should.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:16.020]   All I know is that before I enabled iCloud for iTunes Match, I had a smart playlist for
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.980]   my podcast that would keep my podcast, I would sync my podcast onto my iPhone in chronological
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.940]   order so that the most recent podcast was always at the top.
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.980]   Now is in sort of a weird, unpredictable order and sometimes an ancient as hell podcast will
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.220]   wind up in that list.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:37.860]   The moment that you take something that worked for me and makes it not work anymore is when
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.940]   you start wondering, "Oh, Apple, did you really think this one through?"
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.260]   Here's what I feel like and I'm saying this to someone as an outsider.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.620]   Immediately, I love Apple and I use all the Apple products, but I think I'm somewhat of
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:56.140]   an outsider and I see the world moving towards bigger screen phones.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.500]   I see the world moving towards social.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:06.820]   I see the world moving towards cloud and I see Apple, it feels to me, is maybe there's
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.140]   a big risk anyway, that Apple is going to be left a little bit behind here, that Apple
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:18.140]   is not moving with the rest of the world, that Apple is going to become once again a
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.140]   backwater.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.140]   That was a backwater.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:24.420]   In fact, that's one of the reasons we liked it was that Macintosh was kind of the smaller,
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   the small guy.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.300]   I'm worried that that may be what's happening here too.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:34.260]   You may say, "This is a perfect object," but it's the last small phone.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:40.060]   I got to tell you, no premium phone has a screen that's small anymore.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   That's okay.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.620]   Apple's never really been let themselves be dictated what other people are going to do.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.460]   Maybe they should be there a boutique again.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.700]   Oh, I won't call that.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.820]   They've been selling a lot more than any boutique I've ever visited.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:57.140]   The fact that people are still running towards this device and still selling out two or three
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.980]   months after it's been released says that Apple's still making a product that's compelling
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:05.260]   and that the people who are buying an iPhone don't see the smaller screen as a handicap
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.660]   of any kind.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:11.140]   The question is, if that data actually were to start to surface, would Apple really react
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.140]   to it?
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:17.420]   The first year that we get full results on how fast the Kindle Fire is selling, is that
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.700]   going to tell Apple maybe we should look into creating a seven-inch version of the iPad,
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.060]   find a way to solve that problem and add a third screen resolution to iOS developers?
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.700]   Or do they simply say, "Nope, we decided.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   We decided a long time ago.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.820]   We're not going to do seven inches.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   We tried seven inches.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.820]   Seven inches don't work.
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.500]   We'd 10 or 12 million people who've been buying fires and really really like them.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500]   They're wrong.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500]   We're right.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.500]   Shut up.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.500]   I can't hear you.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.100]   This is seven inches.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.100]   What's going to drive the fire though?
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.740]   It was at $200.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.580]   There was somebody I can't remember who, but one of the financial analysts says what we
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:52.180]   think Apple's going to do, which is code for what I think Apple should do.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.740]   One of the analysts said this week that they think what Apple's going to do is they're going
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.100]   to introduce the iPad 3 and then they're going to keep the iPad 2 out there at the lower price.
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.940]   Sort of like they've done with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 3G and all
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.940]   that stuff.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:04.940]   The only other 3GS rather.
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.700]   The only problem is there's the subsidy tied to all of those.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:11.580]   Apple can keep making the one that costs less because they're still getting money from Verizon
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:18.300]   AT&T, Sprint, a T-Solot out of Saudi Arabia from a bunch of other places.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:23.300]   Is seven inches the question for the fire or is it the lower price for the fire?
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.700]   Those have to be either or I think you're right.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.780]   Low prices driving it, but I have to say I like seven.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.420]   I've always liked seven inches.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.420]   I like that.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.980]   That's weird because you're saying bigger screens for TVs.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   For phones.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.260]   Well, but they say you want to smaller.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.140]   It's not just bigger everywhere.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:45.380]   I like seven inches because it's easy to hold, easy to type on, easy to put in my pocket.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:50.100]   I get as much done on that as I get on a larger iPad because the iPad resolution is
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.420]   frankly not very high.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.860]   This I'd like to see this a little bigger.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.740]   I don't think those are inconsistent.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:04.060]   Anyway, I think interesting.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.580]   Apple could start feeling quaint.
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.180]   There's a risk of that.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.180]   Okay.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.180]   I'm just raising.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.820]   You don't have to agree with me.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:19.060]   No, it's just, I mean, there's the whole, I hate to hate when I get like this because
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:22.460]   it sounds like I can't possibly conceive of anything else doing well.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.340]   I think there's a lot of other stuff that can do well.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.460]   It's the ecosystem thing that really sells out.
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.460]   Oh, I agree.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.460]   I agree.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:32.980]   But if the ecosystem doesn't include social and the cloud, the ecosystem may fall by the
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.700]   wayside spotify may replace iTunes.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.140]   I'd be okay with that actually.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.140]   So would I?
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.140]   Yes.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   Yeah, I'd bet.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.140]   Well, guess what?
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.780]   You have to pay every month for that and a lot of people don't want to pay every month
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:44.780]   for that.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.180]   But you pay, I mean, if you buy a CD a month, you're paying the same amount.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.180]   Right.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.180]   That's why I love Spotify.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.180]   I loved Rhapsody before it.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.500]   Spotify has the social side of it, which is what made me switch over to Spotify.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:59.780]   But I mean, that's what I'm saying is the ecosystem isn't a lock because you're doing
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.900]   stuff as a lock though as far as on hardware.
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.940]   I mean, Spotify is not selling me a phone.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:07.420]   If Spotify gets into phones, I think it would be a mistake, first of all.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:12.140]   But I mean, Apple is still a hardware company with services that sort of tie all of the
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.020]   hardware together, right?
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.380]   As long as those services keep up, but if you can't do cloud and you can't do social
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:24.580]   and you are stuck in the idea of selling songs instead of renting them, maybe you aren't
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   keeping up.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:28.420]   Maybe you've got an ecosystem, but it's a quaint ecosystem.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:31.340]   See, I'm not sure.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:36.660]   It feels to me that like you're putting like a separate requirement on Apple's hardware
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.860]   ecosystem at that point.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.300]   I mean, they do have, I mean, they do have an easy way to make all of this stuff talk,
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.300]   right?
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:45.660]   But I mean, you say if they can't do cloud and they can't do social and they're done.
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.980]   Well, what other hardware manufacturer is doing both cloud and social on their own?
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.380]   They're making those things accessible.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:53.500]   And then the question is, how does it talk to everything else that you have?
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.940]   I'm just saying that you don't have the lock in anymore into that ecosystem.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:02.180]   If people say, well, I love Apple hardware, but I'm going to use Google Docs and Spotify,
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.700]   then your lock in isn't a lock in.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.700]   Okay.
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.700]   That's interesting.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.700]   That's interesting.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   That's interesting.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:09.700]   That's interesting.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:15.180]   Comment when you talk about the possibility of Spotify as a planting iTunes store, to
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.980]   me, Spotify is the ultimate lock in.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:21.420]   You're into all your plan lists, all your content is really being held hostage to your
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.100]   monthly subscription fee.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:27.540]   The reason why I buy most of my almost all of the tracks that I like is because I like
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:31.260]   the fact that once I own it, I own it in a non DRM format, I can play it through my
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.260]   Roku box.
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.260]   I can play through my Apple TV.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.260]   I can play through an Android device.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.260]   It does.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:39.660]   I'm not limited to the devices that Spotify has chosen to support.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:46.140]   Neither am I limited to the interfaces and the way that the Spotify app decides to handle
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.780]   music and handle playlists.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:53.980]   So I do think that Apple should at least look into the idea of, I'm sorry, I really wish
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.580]   that Apple would least experiment with the idea of having some sort of subscription component.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.340]   Because if they were to simply say, "Look for six bucks, we will give you access to 100
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.180]   tracks full bore for free."
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:11.940]   When you add new tracks to this locker, the oldest six or the oldest seven dropout, at
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.300]   least give you a way to sort of hold on to full length, full quality tracks that you don't
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   necessarily own.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.300]   Well, then you're agreeing with me.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.020]   Because I guess what I'm really saying is that Apple has the risk of running the risk
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.340]   of being locked into the book of jobs.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:31.060]   That three and a half inch screens, you may not rent music, you must buy music.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:38.140]   The ping is the ultimate social music network that iCloud really is the best way to do cloud
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.380]   computing.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:43.540]   If you get locked into the book of jobs and you don't look at what is happening and what
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.940]   people want, there's a risk of that's what quaint means to me.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:50.300]   It means being trapped into all things in life.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:56.420]   It's incredibly corrosive to get seduced by dogma.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.140]   When you're doing things only because you've been taught that this is a basic principle
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.060]   and that you don't dare swerve away from this.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:05.620]   Every day, every week, every month, and every year, you have to look at the reasons why
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:08.100]   you do things and see if those reasons still hold up.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.660]   A good decision from two years ago, a good decision from two weeks ago, might not still
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:16.780]   be a new good decision given the new information you have at hand.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:27.580]   Apple's showing a little bit of its historic hardball pulling out from Samsung and moving
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.300]   its business to Sharp in Japan.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:37.140]   Samsung, of course, is in a bitter lawsuit with Apple over what Apple claims is stealing
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.180]   the iPhones, trade dress and so forth in the iPads, trade dress.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.900]   Sharp is now a big partner.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:48.300]   Shifting production to Sharp in Japan away from the Korean Samsung and may, according
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:52.100]   to Piper Jeffery, I'm sorry, Jeffery's in company.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.100]   I got confused.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.820]   Peter Mysek writing at Jeffery's may actually start producing a television with screens
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.620]   from Sharp as early as the middle of 2012.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:02.900]   Sharp is a big player in LCD TVs.
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.140]   As is Samsung, be interesting to see.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.140]   We've talked a lot.
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:09.140]   I'm not going to talk any more about the Apple TV.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.220]   We've talked enough about that.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.340]   We'll just have to wait and see.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.100]   Can I ask Andy one question really quickly?
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:15.100]   Yes.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.300]   You're still thinking no TV?
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.300]   I'm thinking that's going to be the Apple 3D TV.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.860]   That's the little thing they solved.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.580]   They fixed the problem of 3D TV.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   It's 4D.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.580]   Does it really?
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   It's one better.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.580]   Does it come with a...
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.580]   I'm quaint.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.580]   I like 2D.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.460]   I weigh in on the quaint side on that one.
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.460]   Two...
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.060]   You say that I want to send you an eye patch.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.660]   I think that would be funny.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.180]   I don't need an eye patch, actually, because I only use one eye, which is one...
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.220]   Many would say that's why I don't like 3D, because I don't really see it very.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:47.220]   I can see it.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.420]   I think Ken is just saying, and I agree with him, that you would look really, really sexy
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   with an eye patch.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.420]   I have an eye patch.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   I'll go give you that sort of...
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.220]   I don't know Jack Sparrow sort of...
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.060]   At least think about it.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:01.460]   They're selling Apple's founding contract.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:09.340]   The contract that I guess created the corporation Apple Computer, an auction, it's expected to
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:10.340]   bring...
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:13.340]   How much would you pay for the contract signed by the Steves?
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.620]   Who else is on this?
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:19.100]   The three-page document signed by the Steves and Ronald Wayne, Ron Wayne, the guy who after
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:25.700]   a week later after sits, and I don't want to do this, is being sold at auction by Sotheby's.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:30.020]   They expect $150,000.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:35.580]   There it is, Apple Computer Company Partnership Agreement, to whom it may concern...
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:39.140]   Isn't that April 2nd, 1976?
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:45.020]   I think Ron Wayne wrote this, as I remember.
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:48.580]   I think that Blackberry's going to be a really big bidder, because I think that somewhere
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:53.140]   that company, someone thinks that if we simply set it on fire at a crossroads, then bury it.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.580]   It will cause the company to not have ever existed.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:57.820]   Actually, this is...
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.420]   On that basis, it's got to be worth a couple more.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:02.620]   This includes the amendment that says, "As of the date of this amendment, Wayne shall
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:06.740]   here and after cease to function and status of partner in the aforementioned agreement
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:10.340]   in all obligations, responsibilities, agreements and understandings of the agreement of April
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:15.660]   1st, 1976, are here with terminated."
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.460]   That's a separate filing that's not a law.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:20.500]   Yeah, they're going to have both of them.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.260]   I think it has to go for about as much as a set of handwritten Beatles lyrics.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.260]   Ooh.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.300]   I mean, I mean that I think that it would be somewhere within the high low of that range.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:36.540]   Maybe not up there with Let It Be, but definitely more than Digipony.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.540]   I think.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:41.220]   I think it was at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:45.100]   It's either the experience music project or Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the handwritten
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.620]   lyrics to John Lennon's In My Life.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:55.180]   There are places I remember that I would give everything.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.180]   That's just an amazing document.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:01.380]   But you know, the one I really want is also at auction is Houston.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.380]   We have a problem.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.380]   Was it Apollo 8?
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.380]   Apollo 13.
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.380]   Apollo 13.
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   That's right.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:15.180]   13, where they had the Oxygen Lake and they might have been stranded and the paper checklist,
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.420]   which was typewritten.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:21.780]   That's how long ago this was, that the astronauts used to, was it Jim Lovell?
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:25.860]   I can't remember, I boy my memory is fading, but to solve the problem, including his handwritten
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:33.020]   calculations on how much oxygen they had and everything, is that's available too.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.700]   That would be something to have.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:42.300]   Anyway, let us take a break and when we come back, our picks of the week and our tips of
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:47.420]   the week, Andy usually does an Mac OS tip, a lion tip.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.620]   Would you like to do an iOS tip?
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:52.780]   Mr. Ken Ray or we can just pass on that.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.420]   I may have to pass on that.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:30:00.100]   And we do have picks coming up, but first my friends, I'd like to tell you a little, a
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.100]   little story about this studio.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:04.140]   You know, when we first moved in a year.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.540]   Suddenly we were a business, right?
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.620]   I mean, we were in the cottage.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:11.620]   I got away with letting, making my employees use their smartphones for their business phones.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.700]   We had one line and one phone.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:18.060]   I think it was a cordless, so you could go upstairs with it.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:21.340]   And then we came here and people were saying, well, what's the phone system going to be?
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:24.620]   And I said, we need a phone system.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.580]   And then I started thinking about this and I thought, God, this is very 20th century to
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:33.980]   have what a PBX in the basement and go to AT&T and pay all that money and have, you know,
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.980]   all this stuff.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.020]   I said, there's got to be a more modern way to do this.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:41.300]   Fortunately, our great IT guy who I just saw wandering through here, Russell Tammany, said,
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:48.180]   well, you know what, we've used for many of my setups in my clients is Ring Central.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.820]   And I said, Ring Central, what's that?
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:55.420]   He said, well, Ring Central is basically a virtual PBX with no startup costs, no PBX
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:56.420]   machine in the basement.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.500]   It's affordable, easy to set up.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.500]   It is too.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500]   You just plug in the phone.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.500]   You have a phone.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.860]   In fact, we've got a polycom conferencing system.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:09.540]   We've got phones in our offices with multi-lines, just like a real business, but you get so
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.020]   much more than you would with an old fashioned PBX system.
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.060]   You get facts in your inbox.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.220]   I can have calls transferred.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.780]   You know, you call the business line.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:21.580]   I've got an extension that extension can ring my smartphone as well as my phone and
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.660]   my desk.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.660]   It's the number one cloud phone system for business.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:28.460]   We are now using them and couldn't be happier.
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:29.460]   And I want you to give them a try.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:32.620]   In fact, you can have a 30-day risk-free trial.
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.140]   It's that simple because it's all managed.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:38.420]   It's all software is, you know, it's in the cloud there.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:45.500]   RingCentral.com or call 800-847-847.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.060]   You want to hear our Ring Central system?
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:51.860]   Call our 800 number, 800-605-TWIT.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:55.100]   And you'll hear me and I'll give you the tree.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.580]   You hear the music.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.340]   It's really cool.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.020]   It's really, and it was so easy to set up.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:01.020]   Thank you, Russell.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.020]   Thank you, RingCentral.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:09.460]   And find out more at RingCentral.com or call 800-800-4070 to find out more today.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.220]   Andy, you're lying.
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.820]   Now our phones are probably ringing off the hook.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.700]   I should not have done that.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700]   That's all right.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.700]   Don't answer the phone.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:20.740]   It's just our audience.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.300]   I forgot there's so many at the front desk who probably is going to pick up and pick
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.300]   up and pick up.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.220]   And yeah, don't answer the phone.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220]   That's poor Brian.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.140]   Or at least we answered the phone saying, "Hi, Twizzoodos.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.540]   You know the count and the amount."
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.020]   Just depending on the tool.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.260]   That is an oldie but goodie.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.260]   I always wanted to do that.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.900]   I was thinking Martin Stargent could do a dialing for dollars.
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.020]   We should do a dialing for dollars show here at Twitt.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.540]   That would be so much fun.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.940]   Andy, you're a lion tip.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:46.940]   Lion tip.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.900]   Well, there used to be this semi-complicated but really cool hack you could do.
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.260]   So if you wanted your login screen to say something other than what Apple Pre-programmed
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:33:00.020]   to do like something where you know, type in the wrong password and the missiles launch
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:03.700]   on to OctuVM or in a more practical sense.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.340]   Hi, my name is Andy Inato.
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.340]   Here's my email address.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.340]   This is my notebook.
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:11.420]   If it turns up someplace, please email me and I will proceed to it that you will be properly
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.540]   compensated and rewarded for returning this to me instead of just trading it for half
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.340]   a gram of crack or whatever you do with laptops.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.340]   It's a lot of problems.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:23.500]   But with Lion Apple actually added a new twist.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:30.140]   If you go into the Security and Privacy Settings panel and click on General, you actually have
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.460]   the ability to click a checkbox and define what message is going to be shown on your lock
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:35.460]   screen.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:39.060]   So every time you log in or every time that the machine goes to sleep with an ask for
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:42.820]   a password before waking up again, you can have it say this is Andy Inato.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:48.700]   But if you want your notebook returned to me personally, again, I did turn on the chance
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.980]   to buy them, 11 and share.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.580]   So if you'd like to have it mailed to me personally, so I could use it if it gets stolen or lost.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.060]   But all means have this is Andy Inato goes with 11 inch air by all means email him for
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.940]   his address and send it back to him that way.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.620]   Or anything else you want to do to just sort of identify your very generic looking MacBook
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:10.980]   Air or MacBook Pro to identify it from any other machine that might be in the airport
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.180]   security line or in the office.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.180]   Very simple.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.180]   You just click it goes.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.180]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.780]   No hacks, no tricks, no nothing.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:19.740]   And that's a, I believe that's brand new for Lion 2.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.060]   I like that.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.060]   I like that.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.860]   Now I have given out our number again.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:30.340]   Remember, you don't, you don't get the prize package.
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.580]   Let's you also know the phrase that pays.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:39.940]   What is the phrase that pays and can repeat all seven hit all killer no filler songs
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:43.180]   are played at seven minutes past every hour for the past week.
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.980]   You've listened to too much radio, Andy.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.620]   I was gonna make an iOS and tip and pick with I tether.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:51.580]   Did you see this for about five minutes?
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.380]   You could buy this app.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.820]   A tethering app that was in the app store.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:58.340]   And of course, here's the article from a cult of Mac.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:03.020]   Quick get it before it Apple finds out and it was, it's literally was gone in minutes.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:09.980]   It was a $15 app that bypassed all of the wireless companies, you know, stuff and would
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.260]   let you tether your iPhone, your laptop and use this.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.260]   Get approved.
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.500]   How did that get approved?
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.660]   I mean, there was a flashlight app that you went, you had like doing incantation and like
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.820]   switched through three different screens and eventually you could get tethering Apple pulled
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:24.820]   that.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.820]   Can you believe it?
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.820]   And how did this?
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:27.820]   I don't know.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:30.820]   And some people in the chat room got it.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.260]   Web 1340 says it works.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.540]   It doesn't work anymore because it's gone.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:40.180]   And you should remember that when you see this kind of thing that that I believe, maybe
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:45.260]   not, but I believe ultimately that the wireless companies can tell you're doing this and
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.740]   will punish you if not, if not make you pay.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.180]   So one of those emails says, Hey, you're using an awful lot of data.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.180]   Tell you what we're going to do.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.540]   Well, they can see that you're using a desktop browser.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.340]   They can see that you're, I mean, it's not, it's not invisible.
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.500]   The fact that you are using your smartphone to tether.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.500]   Right.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.380]   How did that get through?
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.660]   It's a very good question.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:10.940]   You know, because it actually, it is a germane question because I think people have this
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:14.500]   notion that, well, you know, because Apple vets every application, we can be sure there's
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.780]   no malware.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:17.620]   They may vet it, but no much attention.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.140]   They're paying if this got through.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:23.460]   I don't know, you know, why, why wouldn't malware get through if tether can get through
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.260]   an app named tether?
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:27.260]   Oh, what does it do?
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.260]   Ah, don't worry.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.260]   It's fine.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.260]   Let's put it through.
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.260]   It's fine.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:34.380]   Just, just look, is the color, is the color scheme good?
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.100]   How does that icon look?
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:37.100]   Put it on.
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.620]   If they start writing about it a lot, we'll go back and check and see if it should actually
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.620]   be doing what it's doing.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.700]   Well, that's of course how they found out.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.540]   All the articles about it.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:45.780]   Let us get a pick of the week.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.860]   Can, did you prepare one for us, sir?
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.340]   I did.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:55.620]   And I have to say this is one that I wasn't nearly as into when I first found it.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:59.140]   Last year at Macworld, or this year at Macworld, very early this year at Macworld, there was
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:02.220]   a company there called Zugu.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:06.540]   Z-O-O-G-U-U-G.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:11.100]   And they were giving out to people to try them out and check them out and see what they thought.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.460]   These iPad cases.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.980]   Now, before I show it to you, let me say it's not the prettiest iPad case in the world.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.020]   I'm going to say that up front.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:21.820]   If you go and you look at the website and you think it looks not as pretty as you might
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:24.540]   want it to be, okay.
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.700]   So here's what it looks like.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:26.700]   Okay.
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:27.700]   And I can't.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:28.700]   Oh, it's hideous.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:29.700]   I'm too close.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.700]   Well, it's not.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.700]   No, here's the deal.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.700]   Here's the thing.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:38.420]   When the iPad 2 came out, I decided I was going to get a smart cover because we were
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.420]   all getting smart covers because they're cool, right?
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.420]   And they look cool.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.500]   And so I did that.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:47.540]   And then my girlfriend got my first generation iPad and she got the Zugu case.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:51.100]   And the thing is she does not like the looks of Zugu case.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.820]   And so she just ordered something else.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:53.900]   I don't know what it's called.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.140]   And it looks a little bit more sleek.
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.140]   But here's the thing.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:01.660]   A week after getting that, it doesn't sit quite as well as she wants it to.
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:05.540]   It's not quite as it's everything that she wants it to exactly.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:09.380]   In the meantime, now that my Zugu case was free again, I put it back in my iPad 2.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:11.740]   I put my iPad 2 in it.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:15.020]   Now it's a little loose in there because this one was made for the iPad, not for the iPad
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:16.020]   2.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.060]   But just the way it's made, it sits.
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.460]   I mean, they're relying on the miracle of Velcro.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.380]   I was going to say, is that a magnet?
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.780]   No, it's a Velcro.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:24.780]   No, it's Velcro.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780]   But it works beautifully.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.900]   I can set it at any angle I want to.
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:33.060]   If the surface I'm setting it on is a little bit slanted, that's okay because I can really
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:38.380]   set it at any angle rather than having the three positions that you can do with the smart
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:43.700]   cover or the five or six little nibs that you can set it in in the case that my girlfriend
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.020]   just bought.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.020]   And then it's also the strap on the back so that you can put it if you're driving and
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.940]   the kids are in the backseat and you want them to watch something, there's that right
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:51.940]   there.
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:52.940]   It's that.
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.060]   I mean, it's just a perfectly utilitarian thing.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.060]   I like it.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.060]   It's a little bit thick.
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.100]   Does it look quite as cool as you want it to?
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.100]   No, it's not.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.140]   It's not, you know, a goochier, Versace, or whatever.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:06.260]   But it just it works in such a great way.
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:07.740]   It's almost like I get a new case.
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:11.900]   No, I got my old smart, my old iPad case back.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.060]   So that's it.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.060]   Zugo.
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:22.300]   And the one on here says smart case with a K smart case.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.260]   And I'm just, I love it.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:29.780]   It's making my iPad more useful again, you know, for like, if you get a recipe.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:32.780]   I have to say, I can't do stuff like that.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:36.860]   It's not the prettiest thing you'll ever see, but it's just incredibly functional.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:37.860]   I love it.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.180]   I, you know, I'm about the smart cover as everybody did when the iPad two came out.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:44.860]   And I've dropped the iPad now three times and it's so dinged up because the smart cover
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:46.660]   is not a case.
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:49.020]   And I feel like I should have a case for this thing.
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.180]   The smart cover is cool.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.420]   It's a neat trick.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:56.180]   And after a while, yeah, you kind of want something that maybe, yeah, you lose the smart cover,
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.020]   though, if you use the Zugo, right?
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.020]   Yeah, you do.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.660]   Yeah, they make a smart cover back, but it doesn't have that all that tilt stuff.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:03.660]   Right.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.140]   That's basically just to protect the back of your iPad.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:07.740]   If you're using smart cover, right, which is a different thing.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.340]   I mean, that's a cool thing, but it's a different thing.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.220]   If I have this, I wouldn't have a dinged up iPad.
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:15.540]   But I'm figuring all I have to do is get it through till next June, say March, then
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:16.540]   I'll have an iPad three.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:17.540]   So who cares?
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.220]   Andy and I go your pick of the week.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:27.580]   My pick of the week is a free or pay, depending on how much money you want to spend, utility
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:34.460]   for all of your devices, desktop mobile, desktop, laptop, mobile.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.100]   That is both track your device.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:37.860]   If it gets lost or stolen, it's called pray.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.460]   You can download it from PrayProject.com.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:47.140]   And there are versions that are available for Mac, PC, iOS, Android, even Ubuntu.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:50.500]   Now you've heard of a whole bunch of these different services, usually when someone's
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:56.580]   report of someone buying their stolen laptop or stealing their laptop goes viral and God
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.580]   help.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:02.100]   If there's anything to discourage you beyond good moral turpitude to never ever, ever steal
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.780]   someone's laptop, the idea that everything that someone will make fun of you on Tumblr
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:13.060]   by posting pictures of your stupid, like T-Shirted face staring into a camera and like all the
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:17.700]   pictures you've posted on Facebook to private to share with your girlfriend or boyfriend
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.300]   are now being shared with the entire world.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:24.300]   That's like the curse of, oh, I really, how about if I give you this thing back and give
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.860]   you $8,000 and hope that you have take down this blog so I don't have a blog of what I
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:33.860]   look like when I'm like alone in my room using a losing a notebook.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.500]   The difference between Pray and the others is that Pray is an open source community based
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.500]   project.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.500]   Oh, interesting.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:43.100]   So that you can actually download it and install it and use it for free.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:47.660]   A lot of the basic mechanisms are the same if you realize that your laptop's been stolen
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:52.460]   or it's missing from a web browser from any other device, you can simply activate it.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:56.260]   Your, the Pray software that's installed on the device will occasionally checks in and
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.380]   say, oh, by the way, have I been reported as missing or stolen?
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.380]   I am.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.380]   Okay.
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:03.980]   It's time for me to start sending reports on exactly where I am and what the user is doing
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:10.500]   and screenshots of the desktop and pictures from the web camera to the user.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.900]   The difference though is that if you get it for free, you get a maximum of, there are
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:18.620]   things you can't do, you get a maximum of 10 reports are retained at any given moment.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:24.220]   So whenever, if it's set to set, create a snapshot at any given moment, the 10th that
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:28.980]   when you, when it takes a 10th one, the next oldest one gets, goes into the land of ghosts
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.500]   and winds and is never seen again.
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:36.300]   If you pay up for personal use about five bucks a month, you get a hundred of those.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:42.300]   And also instead of it, of it setting those reports on a fixed routine basis, you can
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.340]   actually also just on demand say, oh, I think that this guy is actually like in a hotel room
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.340]   right now with it.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:48.340]   Let's get a screenshot.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.340]   Let's get a capture data.
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:53.300]   Let's get all the sort of stuff I can send to a cop has asked, where is it right now?
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:56.620]   I can actually do a snapshot right now and get that sort of stuff.
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:01.740]   On the iOS side, it's kind of the question is going to be, I have find my iPhone.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.460]   Why would I actually know this?
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:05.940]   It's not as it's not quite as important.
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:10.020]   But the fact that it's always always checking in on an active basis without you having actually
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:16.780]   babysit things is a big plus also it also has a great a snapshot feature using the front
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:21.140]   facing camera using a pretty cool little trick.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:27.140]   The front facing camera can only be taken over by the front most app at any given time.
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.180]   We're asked on the desktop, any app in the background can activate the camera, take a
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.340]   picture without the person really knowing it.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:37.180]   So what it does is it actually sends sort of a fake SMS that sort of gets the person
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:40.220]   to take out the iPhone and hold it up to their face to read the SMS.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.220]   And that's when that guy's picture gets taken.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.780]   It gets taken sent to you.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.380]   But it's a really cool total solution for everything.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:54.060]   Now, my big questions whenever I look at these services is now I am you're telling me that
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:44:00.940]   I should voluntarily install a key logger and like a snoop and a remote access app.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:05.620]   Basically, I'm volunteering to infect my system with what would be described as mall where
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:08.260]   if I were installing this without my knowledge.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:13.140]   Pray has a nice answer to the question of how to quite why should I trust these guys in
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:16.660]   that all of the code is open source.
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:22.020]   Anybody can investigate it and take a look at it and to see what it's actually doing,
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.900]   which not only hopefully will cause them to not actually slip things in there that you
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:29.980]   don't know about, but also if there's a weakness or vulnerability that other people can exploit
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:35.580]   like if someone decides, oh geez, I think they're using nail the perp, nail the perp
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:41.020]   dot com anti theft software and nail the perp dot com stuff software has a bug in it that
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:44.660]   will allow anybody to hijack this device and get screenshots off of it.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.340]   Hopefully with that kind of openness with pray that sort of bug will not exist.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.860]   If it ever did exist, it would be revealed pretty quickly.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.240]   And if you're that worried about it, you can actually take the source code code and build
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:01.420]   your own copy of pray from from source instead of trusting the binaries there to be downloaded.
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.340]   So also the price is right.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.540]   If you're in sort of position where you're often worried about losing things or things
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:13.100]   getting stolen, if you're on if you're afraid of spending any money per month, this will
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:15.980]   cost you absolutely nothing per month to get this going.
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.740]   It'll work with everything that you're got going.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.820]   And if you actually want to enable the premium services, it's only five bucks a month, plus
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.140]   you get a discount if you decide to buy one year's worth of service at any given shot.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:27.140]   This is really cool.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.460]   I was pretty impressed with it.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:32.380]   Also, I did ask I had to do the paranoid.
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:33.380]   Okay.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:38.140]   Have you heard about pray and do you know if it's just a cover for some sort of Eastern
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:43.180]   syndicate that's just trying to get you know, Amazon.com, sign in information and it actually
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:44.340]   has a pretty good reputation.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:48.740]   I haven't been able to turn up anybody who has anything suspicious to say about it.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:53.980]   That said, realize that you are volunteering to install potentially a key logger and a
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:57.420]   snooper and that sort of stuff in the background.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:03.380]   It doesn't take up much system resources, but realize that you're trading the you're
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.460]   trading one potential hazard for another.
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:09.900]   If your machine does get lost or stolen, you will have this extra tool to recover it.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.620]   However, you're also introducing a possible point of vulnerability.
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:18.340]   And this is the reason why that I have a piece of tape over my over my webcam, where I'm
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.420]   not using it, or at least on my Windows machines.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:21.420]   I do it.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420]   Right.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.420]   Very interesting.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:45.660]   You can put it on Android stuff too, so you can put it on all your devices if you want.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.660]   It's just open source.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:47.660]   It's been ported just about anything.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:51.140]   I will be very curious if we get a whole bunch of emails saying, "Oh my God, I can't believe
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.420]   you're recommending pray."
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.180]   It's not an East Coast that it can.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.180]   It's a West Coast crime.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.180]   It's just confusing.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.220]   I don't think so.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:59.620]   I don't think so.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.340]   Ken Ray is at MacOSKen.com.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:06.540]   Listen to his show every single day, except weekends.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:07.540]   Right?
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:08.860]   Every single day that weekend.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:14.660]   Somebody has to take some time off sometime at MacOSKen.com.
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:20.900]   And you should also follow him on Twitter as you see @MacOSKen.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.980]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.980]   It's always great to talk to you, Ken, and get your insights into all of this.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:25.980]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.980]   I appreciate it.

[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.820]   It is my birthday.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.100]   So they are now going to humiliate me.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.860]   You're probably wondering why I have balloons growing out of my head.
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:00.340]   Yeah, I want to do that.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.340]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.740]   Now, get back to work.
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:03.740]   Great time is over.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:04.740]   Get back to work.
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.740]   I told you.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:06.740]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.740]   Look, I'm fifth.
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:10.340]   Either I'm five twice.
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:11.340]   Thank you.
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.340]   Don't sing Happy Birthday.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:13.340]   We'll have to pay AOL money.
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:14.340]   Go ahead.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.340]   You can do it.
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:16.340]   You just won't want to get it.
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:23.020]   Don't sing Happy Birthday.
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.620]   The Beatles are already in us for millions.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:27.620]   Thank you.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:30.620]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.620]   Spanking machine.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.620]   Yeah, the spanking machine awaits.
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:35.620]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:36.460]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
