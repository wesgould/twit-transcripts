[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160]   Andy's on the phone and--
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.800]   yeah.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.600]   Alan is so upset.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.040]   He says, I'm out of here.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280]   You wait to lose your audience, Leo.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.360]   No, I think people like this stuff.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.880]   No, you know, for some reason, this really bugs people.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.560]   And I'm not sure why.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.320]   There's something very small, but a number of people.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.800]   Most people are about that very positive.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.560]   No, that's fine.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.040]   But for some reason, it bugs people.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.520]   And I'm not sure why it does.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.120]   This is not that complicated.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840]   Like, I dropped off my car and we fixed last night.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   And I knew that was the mechanic.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   And I--
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.000]   It was a chance to say, yes, by all means, please go and fix.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.080]   It's like picking up today.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.800]   I'm like, oh, but Leo's going to be entertaining the audience
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   for a good five minutes or--
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.320]   You got time.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.800]   I'm sure there's nothing here.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.120]   You got time.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.320]   All right, we're ready to begin here.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.000]   I'm recording.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.840]   Whenever you said I wholeheartedly agree with your status--
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.240]   You'd be a fool to do otherwise.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.920]   I control the microphone.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.560]   You are the titan.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.080]   The titan of self-broadcasting and self-blowing.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   If anybody knows--
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.320]   I put my money where my mouth is.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200]   Give away, Sharers like-- oh, actually, they did give you
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   that chair.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.120]   But still, that example.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   No, no, we paid for this chair.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.320]   Oh, there you go.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.960]   We paid for it.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.480]   They don't get it for--
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   They don't just give away those chairs.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.120]   No, they don't.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.040]   That's the focal point of years worth of business acumen,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   quality content, respecting your USRS
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.600]   and building a solid community.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.080]   A community that I too hope to exploit for my own personal
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.000]   content.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.440]   Exactly.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.560]   Exactly.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320]   Exactly.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.160]   Exactly.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   All right.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   There you go.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.920]   The other reason I don't really want to start the show
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   is there's nothing to talk about.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.360]   Yeah, no, I'm going to put this--
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   what you just did on the show somehow.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   OK.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's more interesting than the rundown.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200]   So here we go.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.440]   Should we just read public domain Christmas stories?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.600]   I will-- here's what I'll do.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   I'll give you an intro that gets you into that.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.960]   And then we'll give you an outro out of that.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.880]   Awesome.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.560]   Mac and Tosh and Apple and iOS in great detail.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   And the core group-- the core is here
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.200]   in our pre-holiday episode.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   Hanukkah begins tonight.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.760]   Christmas is Sunday.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.800]   But Alex Lindsey is here back from his travels
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   around the world.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   May I see?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   Where would you last?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400]   Tell me the countries you've been--
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.160]   In the last couple of weeks, I was in Paris and then New York
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.880]   and then Japan.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   Were we in Paris at the same time?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.160]   We were-- I think we were just--
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   We missed each other.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.800]   Paris, New York, and Japan.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.280]   Is it all a sales source?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.760]   A lot of it.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.960]   A lot of it was--
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.080]   Yeah, so we were doing a lot of different streaming.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   Wow.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.600]   But--
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.280]   And I'm going to ask you about the Niners game last night
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.160]   in a second, because I know you're a Steelers fan.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.680]   I want to talk about it.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.040]   I'm not going to rub it in.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.120]   What I really want to talk about is FaceTime in Japan.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.320]   I want to talk about that too.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.560]   Also here, Andy and Aco and Andy,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.600]   it's really great to have you back with your sisters.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720]   Because Andy was--
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.080]   Sorry.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.680]   That's from the movie-- because we talked about this on Sunday
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.520]   because you were on Twitch.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.480]   By the way, thank you. That was a wild tweet.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   That was a great thing to be part of.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.040]   It was worth getting up early four on a Sunday night
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.200]   at 6 p.m.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   To take part in that.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   Well, thank you for being the voice of reason there.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   Poor Harry McCracken was just shell-shocked.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   And then Niele and I were like fisticuffs.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.440]   But I think it was a really good conversation about SOPA
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.000]   and all of this stuff.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   And Niele Patel is like an old fart.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.680]   I don't understand it.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.600]   I'm the old-- I should be the old fart.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.480]   He's going, no, there's got to be a compromise.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.280]   I said, there's no compromise.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.640]   What are you talking about?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.680]   SOPA was created by the devil.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680]   Well, his position was--
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.760]   Devil.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.520]   --that you can't make it polarized black and white.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.040]   You can't say there's--
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.800]   SOPA is the devil.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.320]   And then there should be--
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.360]   you have to do something about piracy.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.240]   And I was saying, well, it's not that I support piracy.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.920]   But the problem, really, in my opinion, the problem
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   is that once things is bits, there's no technical--
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.600]   and Niele never came up with one--
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.920]   but there's no technical solution that allow--
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.320]   there's no DRM that works.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.160]   If a pirate wants to crack it, they can crack it.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.400]   So any technological solution is going to be flawed,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.120]   is only going to hamper legal users,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.360]   and is going to never is going to slow down pirates.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   And to me, the real issue is that what you really have
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.360]   is you have an older generation that says,
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.320]   yeah, we understand.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.880]   The internet's here.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.720]   But we don't want to come up with new business models that
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.040]   work.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.720]   We'd like to preserve our old business models.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480]   So let's break the internet rather than break our business
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.760]   models.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520]   So it's really, I think it's a very clear choice
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.000]   between breaking the business models that they have
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.440]   and breaking the internet.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.320]   And Niele, we were in agreement about that.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   Our only disagreement was Niele said, well,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.240]   there's some middle ground where you could somehow
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.760]   preserve these business models without breaking the internet.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.000]   No, I just don't think that's technically feasible.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No, I think it's--
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   I'm not sure if he was saying that there's a way of preserving
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.040]   the business models.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   But that's essentially--
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.000]   But that's what it is.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.400]   I mean, because the thing is, is that Apple sold billions
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.560]   of songs inside of massive piracy
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.760]   because they made it easier.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   You know, they made it easier.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.080]   Well, that's what Niele was saying.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   You know, the copy protection in Netflix works
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.760]   and said it's not the copy protection.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.920]   It's the ease.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.960]   It's point of access.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   Copy protection doesn't get funded only for--
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.320]   iTunes was an interesting initial example
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.280]   because it proved that people don't really care about DRM
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.800]   so long as they care about access and ease of use.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.040]   So given that so many of the iTunes initial users were using it
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.200]   to load content specifically on Apple approved devices,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.800]   whether or not they then had the right to copy that content
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.400]   onto any arbitrary device, they didn't so much care about that.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.440]   As long as they delivered the purchase mechanism.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   But that's missing the point because the DRM
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.040]   didn't stop piracy in any way.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   Although it's easy to strip the DRM out of fair play content.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   It's trivial.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.800]   So one can do that.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.360]   The only people who were hampered by the DRM in iTunes
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.600]   was those of us who said, well, I'd
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.720]   like to play it on a sixth computer and couldn't.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.400]   And so the people who bought it with the ones who DRM screwed
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.160]   and the people who wanted to pirate it,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.880]   pirated all they wanted.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.800]   It doesn't slow down piracy.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.480]   It merely is a technological cluge
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.080]   that inconveniences real users.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.960]   And that's why they dropped it, by the way,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.840]   because it didn't do anything.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.160]   Which was Apple's point all along.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.360]   Yes.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.680]   But the great thing about the SOPA debate has always been--
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.640]   excuse me, for me, is just that it
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.720]   brings the larger debate and every faction of that debate
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.080]   just in the forefront and into play.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.760]   And just reminds you that there's so many different opinions
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.440]   on what the future of distribution should be.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.840]   There's some people who even think that Louis CK's model was--
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.680]   I'll shorthand--
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.720]   two pages of very, very thoughtful blog posting
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.760]   from somebody down to the core sentence, which is,
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.680]   Louis CK is a fascist for charging money
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.280]   for his first concert video.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.720]   He should just give it away for free,
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.880]   not force us to pay an over credit card number.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.080]   I'm doing the right just thing by putting this on BitTorrent,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.160]   because I'm helping to promote his live show, which
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.360]   is where he makes his money from, by helping
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.840]   to spread the word on his great comedy.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.720]   So that's one polar side of it.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.560]   So the people who are advocating SOPA is the other polar side
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.760]   of it.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.280]   No, but see, I think that's a long side.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.840]   I'm the polar side of it, which says
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.640]   that there is no technological solution that
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.040]   doesn't break the internet.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.920]   There are going to be people who will steal.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.440]   I mean, look, there's thieves in the world.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.360]   This guy's a thief, and he's rationalizing his thievery.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   Their thieves in the world, my point
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.240]   is you can't do anything about them technologically.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.600]   So you need a business model that bypasses them.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.920]   And the best business model of all is Louis CK's business
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.800]   model, which is, hey, community, I love you.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.720]   If you love me, pay for it.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.680]   And he's made almost $750,000 to date.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.480]   Seems like a good model.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.640]   It's our model.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.480]   And the thing is, is that when you're really providing
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.720]   a service, when we started DV Garage,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.000]   I was putting up little free videos constantly.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.680]   These little videos on how to do this.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.400]   People were buying our products simply to support us
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.640]   continuing to make those videos.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   Because we were doing something useful.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.960]   And they were like, I'm buying the product.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.200]   I don't even need your product.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.680]   But I'm paying $150 short, because I
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.960]   want you to keep on making the videos
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.520]   that you're making for free.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.760]   And the thing is, is when you're really providing a use
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.240]   and you're really doing something,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.680]   I think that that is the--
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   that's what's missing often.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.320]   Some people keep saying, well, but Louis CK was famous.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.600]   Well, I don't understand how that's a tangent.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.920]   I don't understand how that has anything to do with piracy,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   not piracy.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.160]   Or people who are famous don't get
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.640]   pirate of people who are not famous do get pirate of it.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.960]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.280]   It has nothing to do with the piracy debate.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.600]   But it's a response to a lot of these outfits
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.480]   that are being written are saying that, well, Louis CK
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.960]   proves that all I have to do is you don't need a distributor,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.200]   you don't need to be on TV.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.240]   All I need to do is just set up a store,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.720]   your own storefront, sell things directly to the people.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.040]   And you'll make a million dollars just like Louis CK.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.960]   Well, if you're great, you will.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.200]   Justin Bieber is doing all right.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.760]   Well, not even if you're great.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.920]   I mean, the reason why he had such a success
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.000]   was that he's been a comic for 30 years.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.160]   Why did Justin Bieber have success?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.680]   Partly because--
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.160]   He's right out of the internet, baby.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   Pompa-loos.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.000]   Well, no.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.840]   He was good.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.680]   Pompa-loos.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.520]   That's what he was making.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.360]   Jonathan Colton.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.560]   There are people who are not TV famous
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.120]   who are doing great.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.400]   But not making a million bucks great.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.840]   Well, I mean, I don't know if it's a million bucks,
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.680]   but I know that--
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.520]   You know how much--
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   You would guess Justin Bieber makes more than Louis CK.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.400]   I would be my guess.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.160]   But realize that at some point he struck a deal
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.880]   with somebody who could convert talent
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   and exposure into actual cash.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.360]   He didn't have to, but he did.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.520]   They're a bunch of--
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.480]   There's still-- I think there's hangers on in the old--
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.600]   In the old media--
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.640]   Well, but who decides--
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   I think--
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.000]   And I think this is--
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I don't--
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   --the transition of the whole period--
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.440]   That's going to happen.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.800]   All I'm saying is that Louis CK is a data point.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.080]   It's not a proof.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.560]   Well, there's tons of data points.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.440]   I can give you-- we can go on and on and on.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.240]   Paul Coelho, the alchemist, couldn't get it published.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.920]   It got pirated.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.040]   And he realized-- and it started selling in Russia
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.880]   in a pirated version.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.520]   He thought, wow, that's interesting.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.120]   I can't get this thing published.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.880]   And so he started putting it on BitTorrent himself.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.280]   And I think he's doing all right.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.400]   I think there are infinite-- not infinite,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   but there are multiple data points.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.560]   And the thing is--
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.160]   It doesn't have to be proven because that's almost even
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.480]   a subsidiary argument to the fact
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.720]   that there's no technological solution that
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.040]   doesn't break the internet and disadvantage honest users
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.400]   without slowing down pirates in the least.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.680]   So an attempt to find this middle ground,
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.280]   this imaginary middle ground that Neil I was talking about,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.040]   is futile.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   Well, I think the other--
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.200]   It doesn't even matter.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   It's just the way it is.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.840]   It comes-- it's like-- I think I said this on Sunday, too.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   It's the idea of that store where
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.280]   you have to leave all your bags at the front counter
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.880]   when you enter, when you leave somebody with a flashlight,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.320]   we'll check to make sure that everything you're
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.680]   carrying has a receipt.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   I might shop there once, but I'm never coming back there again.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.120]   It's possible that you're so concerned about losing 5%
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.640]   of your income through theft, that you're
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.280]   willing to lose 20% to 30% of your business
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.760]   just by including such tight controls that you're
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.800]   making your business such a pain in the butt.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.640]   So Web 88.95 has said 18 times what
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.000]   about the struggling small guy getting pirated?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.640]   You're missing the entire point here.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   First of all, there's plenty of struggling small people.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.400]   You do-- you make a business model that
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.040]   doesn't require you to play whack-a-mole.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.120]   Otherwise, you're going to get screwed.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.360]   So if you set up a business model,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.080]   basically an old-style, old-school business model that
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.520]   requires DRM, you're screwed.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   Forget it.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.640]   Well, dear--
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.960]   Well, DRM is different.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.680]   I mean, there are some success stories
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.000]   on people who managed to sell their content on the Kindle
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.520]   store and on the iBook store.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.480]   They are getting a pretty OK trade.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.640]   The Kindle store and the iOS store
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.480]   say that you have to control all your stuff via DRM.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.040]   However, we will make it easy for people
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.600]   to find your content.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.400]   We'll make it easy for people to pay for your content.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.680]   If you are struck by a bolt from the gods,
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.480]   and for some reason, we put you in the top 10 list
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.080]   or give you a profile tile on the top page,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.200]   that's going to translate into sales, too.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.720]   So given that DRM is something that's
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.880]   pretty much invisible to Kindle owners,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.720]   given that they don't have two or three different devices,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.760]   that if they have different devices,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.320]   they have devices that can be supported directly
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.520]   by the Kindle app, DRM is a total non-factor
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.280]   in their buying decision and has a real benefit
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.080]   to these independent authors who don't already
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.880]   have a built-in audience.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.200]   But I agree with you that in general, the more you--
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.640]   there's the old saying that a market is like an egg,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.880]   that you don't control it by squeezing tighter.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.080]   If you squeeze tightly, you lose it completely.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.600]   So that's the best privilege.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.120]   When you criminalize this stuff, it
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.120]   turns people into criminals.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.080]   So it's completely the opposite effect.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.440]   And it's not working.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.960]   So Nilai comes from a legal background
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.320]   where in which there is always a compromise position.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.440]   That's how politics works.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.120]   There's always a middle ground.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.360]   And he's right.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.720]   The polarization prevents that kind of compromise.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.040]   But where I disagree with him is that such a compromise exists.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.320]   And I think the truth is, it doesn't even matter what
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.520]   will end up happening as a result of if SOPA passes,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   is merely that there'll be a second tier internet where--
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   it was already happening.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.960]   There's a Firefox plugin now that goes around it.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.880]   So what'll happen is we technologists will just say,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.000]   well, screw you, you can have your little government-run
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.240]   internet, and we'll see you later.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.040]   And I think that that's really what will end up happening.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.600]   It'll stratify the internet.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.240]   And there'll be an internet that non-sophisticated users
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.120]   use that is censored just as there is in China.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   And then there'll be an internet that is wide open
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.600]   and that they can't do anything about.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.040]   But there's no-- I don't see--
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.920]   I understand what Nilai was saying was,
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.360]   you can't go to Congress and say, you're wrong.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.680]   You have to come up with a--
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.520]   you have to go to Congress and say, here's what we propose.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.600]   And I don't disagree.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.120]   I think that if you want Congress to play a long,
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.920]   you have to.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.600]   But there is-- I don't know what you give them.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.720]   And he never came up with anything.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   He never said, well, here's my proposal.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.240]   He said, well, I'm sure one exists.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.480]   I mean, the bottom line is, is for those of us
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.120]   who are paying attention, is that we just
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.080]   have to remember that for the most part, not always,
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.760]   but for the most part, most of these representatives
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.720]   are highly sensitive to criticism.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.000]   This is democracy.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.360]   They want everyone to like them.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.560]   And so the thing is, is that you can't just stop them
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.640]   by blistering.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.200]   If you just hammer them with the massive amounts of upset--
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.080]   email, by the way, is very ineffective,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.880]   because these are going to do a snail mail and phone call.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.680]   Snail mail and phone calls is how you get their attention.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.240]   And you just-- and you know, when they can't make a phone--
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.520]   when they can't pick up the phone, if they can just keep on it,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   every time they pick up the phone,
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.960]   there's someone that's upset about it.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.560]   They're not going to vote for it.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:25.920]   And that's the--
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.120]   CNN, that's the bottom line.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.000]   By the way, everybody keeps--
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.360]   I keep hearing this one, too.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.640]   Well, Leo, what if somebody edited out all of your commercials
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.800]   and put it on YouTube?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.600]   Go ahead.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.840]   Please do.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.000]   In fact, the license allows you to do that.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.560]   Our license on all of our shows is you
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   may do anything you want with them for non-commercial purposes,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.080]   as long as you put attribution in.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.920]   And that includes editing out all the commercials
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   and reposting them.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.040]   It's my opinion that our audience wants us to succeed.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.840]   It's one of the reasons our commercials work
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.200]   is because our audience actually goes out and uses the products
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   as a way of supporting the program.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.640]   So please be my guest, CMMTS.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   Go right ahead.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.320]   We haven't been able to figure out your audio issue.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   Do you want Jammer B to plug in and a troubleshoot
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.560]   before the show?
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.960]   No, I don't think I'm going to be playing any audio.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.760]   OK.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.600]   All right.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.640]   And if so, I can.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.320]   Because I know if I do, they'll pull us off YouTube.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.760]   OK.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.640]   I'm really-- I'm so tempted just to withdraw from YouTube.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.280]   I feel like we should make a statement that if YouTube is
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.160]   going to be this way, we're just not going to participate.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.880]   I really feel like that's how we should do it.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.320]   But no, that's exactly right, Web 51.90.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.680]   If you want to rebroadcast our HD stream,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.480]   you are absolutely free to do so.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.120]   So this is another example.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.400]   So he's saying, well, if you do a pay HD stream,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.520]   you're going to have to shut down people who rebroadcast.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.040]   And no, because the only reason it's pay is because the bandwidth.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.800]   If you want to rebroadcast it, please do.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.760]   Be my guest.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.800]   I would love that.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.720]   That would be great.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.000]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.440]   People don't understand.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.240]   They really don't get it.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:20.800]   Well, they think that you have to fight piracy.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.040]   And any business model that doesn't account for piracy
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.480]   happening is not going to work because piracy happens.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.400]   Period.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.480]   Period.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.800]   I'm reminding when the least pleasant, like little talks
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.000]   or debates I've ever had in public,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.640]   it was at the University of Colorado,
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.000]   talking about the future copyright with a lawyer who had never
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.280]   written anything but knew the law, like, inside and out.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.240]   So he always saw all this, no legal basis for this.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.480]   And there should be-- the federal government should not
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.120]   give any protection to.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then every time, it was him, me, and another author saying,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.640]   well, how do we go about writing something?
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.680]   If we put two years into writing a novel,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.400]   how do we make sure the someone can't simply take that,
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.680]   publish it themselves, do a couple of search and replaces
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.880]   and turn to a zombie pirate vampire novel with 20 minutes
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.680]   for the effort, and they make the money.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.320]   We don't because they have better distribution
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.200]   and better audience.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.480]   He says, well, that's your problem.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.840]   Be sure to be happy that your work is being shown in front
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.720]   of a larger audience.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.800]   And that was the point where I'm like, wow.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.040]   And I didn't have an answer to it because it just seems so silly.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.600]   But I'm sorry.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.160]   So I'm trying to restrain myself because I
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.320]   know that this is an issue where if I don't think four times,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.080]   I say twice as stupid things.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.840]   But all I'm saying is that there is a difference
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.960]   between the way that you do your business.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.200]   Because by the time that video is on YouTube,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.840]   you've already sold the advertising.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.920]   You've already gotten the check for the advertising.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.840]   That's perfectly true for your business.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.480]   But for other people's business, it's possible that by the time
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.880]   something is taken out of the sales context,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.280]   they originally put them in and put it on YouTube,
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.000]   they get a little bit of attention maybe.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But they definitely lose whatever money
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.800]   that they were going to make for sales.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   The problem is if the added attention
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.440]   was going to be a net benefit to them,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.480]   and I do believe that in the end, the more people see your work,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.320]   the more people are liable to pay for your work,
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.600]   that should be that person's choice about whether or not
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.720]   they want to take that risk.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.360]   The thing is that inside of the system--
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.120]   we talk about the little guy getting screwed--
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.640]   inside of this whole system, I used to work for Sony Music.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.000]   And it got to a point where I had so many friends that
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.160]   had been not necessarily by Sony, but had been so screwed
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.040]   over by the record companies, that I wouldn't even
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.840]   try to get them signed.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.720]   I wasn't going to be part of that system.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.440]   I wasn't going to be part of helping them.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   I didn't know how-- that 20 years ago,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   there was no other way to do it.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.920]   But I watched my friends lose rights to all of the songs
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.960]   that they've been working on for years.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.640]   They'd-- to MCA or whatever, and then MCA decides not
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.520]   to publish the album, but they're not going to give up
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   the rights.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.640]   And so now these guys can't publish what they had been
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   building for a decade.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.080]   And these are the kind of things that happen all the time.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.880]   And so that's inside of a system that's
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.000]   supposed to help the little guy is you basically Hollywood
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.760]   and-- I mean, not all of Hollywood,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.800]   but they're a big chunk of Hollywood
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.920]   and a big chunk of the music industry is just full of vipers.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.040]   And it's just-- and there's always exceptions.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.920]   And I have friends in New York and friends in Hollywood
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.000]   and friends in the music industry that I know are
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.960]   exceptions to this rule.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.360]   But man, when people talk about, oh, I'm going to go get my script.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.760]   I'm going to take my script to Hollywood.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.880]   And I'm like, yeah, and someone's going to-- you're
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.560]   going to show it around.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   And someone else is going to get the--
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.960]   they're going to make a movie that looks just like your script.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.840]   And you're not going to get any--
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.360]   anything for it.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.640]   I just say be a realist and consider the world we live in
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.480]   and come up with a business model that works.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.400]   There's a great post by Trey Radcliffe on Google
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   plus five reasons why I don't care if my stuff is
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.600]   pirated a new way of thinking read it.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.880]   Here's a guy who puts all his very beautiful photography
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.440]   up, unprotected, creative commons, and does just fine,
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.040]   by the way, just fine.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.520]   And so my suggestion-- you don't have to believe what I say,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.280]   but my suggestion, if you have--
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.000]   if you're a content creator is to think of a business model
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.280]   that works in a modern world instead of trying to set the clock
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.960]   back to a pre-internet world so that your business model works,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   you cannot take the world and bend it to your business model.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.920]   You have to bend your business model to the world.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.480]   That's all.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.720]   But I want to say something.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   As the surface says, good for him, he's established.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.720]   How do you get established?
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.760]   You get established by--
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.680]   He was not established.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.760]   But Trey made himself established using the internet doing this.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.960]   But it's not something that you're going to--
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.320]   if you have an idea for a book, the part of this business
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.840]   model is I'm going to then spend a year or two years developing
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.200]   a reputation, doing something in the community
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.480]   that I'm trying to work inside of, doing something--
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.120]   you have to get your name out to establish yourself,
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.040]   takes a lot of work.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.200]   And that's the thing that people--
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.520]   And he used all of these tools, including giving away
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.640]   his photographs, to establish himself.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.720]   Trey is a perfect example of a guy who did not
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.000]   come through traditional means.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.200]   He came up through the internet.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.280]   And he used Google+ Facebook and Twitter, his website,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.240]   and gave away photos from day one.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.680]   So that's the point.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   Justine.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.320]   Justine is another great example.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   I mean, I can give you--
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.280]   It's interesting.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.720]   People get very-- I don't know why people get so upset by this.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.440]   It's just--
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.120]   Well, it's kind of almost the physical universe.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's just the way it is.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.960]   Justine has a Rick, it's a good example,
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.600]   because no matter how crazy some of her videos are,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.520]   you need to understand.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.720]   As someone who knows her fairly well,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.520]   nothing about her is an accident.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.400]   She's brilliant.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.840]   I mean, there is nothing--
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   She's an accident.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.440]   There's nothing to ask them of a young person who used the way
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.040]   it is as a business model, rather than saying,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.600]   let's see, I'm going to come up with a business model
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.440]   and then try to bend the internet to my will.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.080]   She was just--
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.200]   It's really straightforward.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:02.840]   I don't know.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.040]   And people say, oh, well, someday,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.240]   there'll be a technological solution.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.360]   That's not the point.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.480]   The world is the way it is.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.280]   Think of how you can make yourself work with the world
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.360]   the way it is.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.880]   It's life.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.800]   It's people beat their heads.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.440]   I see this all the time in all sorts of realms.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.840]   People beat their heads against reality,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.760]   saying, no, it shouldn't be that way.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.320]   Instead of saying, OK, this is how it is.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.200]   What works in that context?
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.800]   But we got to talk about Macintosh here.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.400]   Before we go on, though, I got to explain
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.800]   why there's a stripper pole right here.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.960]   It's not a stripper pole.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.720]   It's festive, it's my friends.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.760]   If it was a stripper pole, it'd be glossy.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.520]   That's right.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   It'd be brass-y.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.120]   But you can see that it is very dull looking.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.400]   It's an aluminum pole because George Costanza--
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.680]   and his father, Frank, don't like to decorate the pole
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.240]   for Christmas.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.680]   They celebrate instead of Christmas,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.800]   instead of Kwanzaa, instead of Winter Solstice,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.200]   instead of Hanukkah, they celebrate
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Festivus for the rest of us.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.480]   And actually, I had to look this up.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.520]   First of all, I came in, and I said, what the hell
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.360]   is that doing there?
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.560]   Did Brent forget to take something down?
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.800]   And John goes, it's Festivus.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.720]   I got to point out, you've put it in such a way
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.440]   that's coming straight out of my head.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:12.960]   OK, there.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.320]   I'll sit like this.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.040]   And I said, of course, it's Festivus.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.360]   We got to celebrate Festivus.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.240]   And if you don't know what Festivus is,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.120]   you can read about it on Wikipedia.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.800]   It was actually predates Seinfeld.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.680]   I didn't know that.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.920]   The Seinfeld writer, Dan O'Keefe,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.080]   who put that in the script, actually, his dad
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.320]   started Festivus years before, and they celebrated that
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.840]   in his family, so it was real.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.320]   Anyway--
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.120]   Well, actually, before-- actually, I did have this handy.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.480]   And I didn't know--
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.040]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.280]   I was kind of like, just wear this around my neck.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.400]   Yeah, on Dasher, on Prancer.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.680]   So that every time that I make the slightest movement
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.880]   during the show, I'll be making a noise.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.800]   So every time I take a drink, I'll also
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.080]   be making a noise.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.920]   I just wanted to ask first to see if that was going
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.520]   to be really annoying for the listeners and for everybody else.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.120]   Not at all.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.160]   We love it.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.600]   There you go.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.440]   It's very Festivus.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.880]   All you need is your red nose, and you
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.960]   could be in that code, the red nose.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.840]   Where did you get those are actual slave bells?
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.080]   Those are not like some cheap Christmas decoration.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.840]   This is the real-- you've got to have a horse in order to--
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.280]   Does it smell like a horse?
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.040]   It's made out of leather, baby.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.720]   I could wear this like an ascot.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.240]   I got so many bills here.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.360]   Is that a family thing that was handed down,
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.120]   or did you find that at the MIT flea market?
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.520]   I came across this in my travels,
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.240]   asked if somebody wanted it, and someone did not
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.480]   want it to my shock and horror.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.120]   And I said, well, you're not throwing this out.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   I'm taking it.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.320]   Of course, the person he was asking was a horse.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.960]   Yeah, it didn't say anything.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.040]   He hangs on the back of my door year round,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.960]   and only today they realize, oh, wait a minute.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.560]   I could actually take this off the door and have fun with it.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.800]   Yay.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.640]   Oh, lardy, lardy, lardy.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.480]   All right, we do-- there is a little bit of news.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:57.960]   Is it a news day?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.080]   You betcha.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.760]   The reason we do best steps-- and next week,
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.440]   we're going to do a best of a Mac break week.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.840]   We've got us some highlights from the year and stuff.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.360]   But the reason we do that is because this is usually
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.640]   a very dead time.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.400]   I mean, nobody's doing anything.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.480]   I don't even think that they probably shut Cupertino down.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.080]   This time of year.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.680]   But there is a few things.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.200]   And we'll talk about those in just a second.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   How about that?
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.720]   That's perfect.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.560]   How about that for a tease?
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.280]   Something must have happened this week,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.000]   and we'll find out about it in a bit.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.840]   But first the word about Haba.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.520]   Haba, I haven't talked about Haba in a while,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.960]   and I should mention this.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.680]   You know, a lot of times--
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.400]   I don't know.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.320]   Do you do this?
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   You're listening, or you're thinking, sometimes I do this
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.840]   in a shower.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.360]   I go, that would be a great domain name.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.960]   And I say, I got a register that domain name.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.000]   Do you hover in the shower?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.680]   I hover in the shower.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.320]   I do.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.400]   The last time that happened, Jennifer and I were at dinner.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.680]   And what did she come up with?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.800]   We actually registered this at dinner.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.040]   This is going to be good.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.760]   It was some weird--
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.360]   she-- something about tunics.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.640]   Tunic time-- I think it was tunictime.com.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.000]   She wanted to do a tunic online tunic store.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.640]   She gets these ideas.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   And she actually made me register it.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.560]   Now, the good news is I have a hover account.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.320]   So I went right to my hover account on my smartphone,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.000]   on my iPhone.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.680]   And I created tunictime.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.760]   I think it's tunic-- let me just see here.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.120]   This is my hover account.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.280]   By the way, the hover domain management console is fantastic.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.000]   I want you to go to Macbreak.hover.com to register your
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.080]   domains from now on.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.440]   You just type tunictime.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.560]   And you could choose dot com.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.800]   But they'll also give you the others.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.080]   Now, actually, there's something cool that
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.040]   Hover is doing that nobody else does.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.440]   And I want to show you this.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.080]   Gosh darn, I'm still having trouble with Chrome.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.960]   Do you guys ever have trouble with Chrome on the Mac?
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.480]   It's really slow.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.760]   In Lion, yes.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.160]   It's Lion and Chrome.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.960]   Lion and Chrome do not get on.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.120]   I have to go back to Safari.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.360]   Anyway, so here, notice tunictime.net is available.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.880]   I have tunictime.com.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.440]   So they make some suggestions.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.280]   And see the star?
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.520]   It's a premium domain.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.120]   So this is something that they're doing new that I really like.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.640]   Somebody owns tunictease.com.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.680]   But it's willing to sell it.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.800]   And they've actually set a price.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.360]   Now, this is great for people like me.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.160]   Actually, for anybody, you don't want the price to go up
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.360]   just because you're inquiring about it, right?
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:28.860]   Right.
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.040]   Hi, this is Leo LaPorte from Twitter.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.720]   I'm wondering if twit.com is available.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.320]   Yes, it is $1 million.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.280]   So you don't want to do that.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.000]   So this, they've already set the price.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.360]   And you see it right there.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.040]   So normally, it's very affordable to register a domain name
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.240]   from Hover.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.600]   But this particular company, tunictease.com,
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.040]   wants 1,788 bucks.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.560]   I don't know where they came up from that.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.840]   So that's a premium domain name.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.120]   And this is really cool.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.080]   Now, if you upgrade to a premium domain,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.920]   here's tunicoblog.com.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.640]   I think they're over-pricing tunicoblog.com.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.080]   Timely tunictop.net.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.120]   Tunic Biloxi.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.480]   Evidently, that's very valuable.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.000]   Cheaptimes.com, that would be good.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.520]   I'd get cheaptimes.com.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.080]   That's a deal at $15.99.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.360]   Anyway, you can register one of these premium domains
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.440]   and trade in your clunkers.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.680]   So in a little while, it's going to become apparent
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.320]   that tunicteime.com is, in fact, not the big money maker
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.280]   that we thought it was.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.760]   And we're going to want to get rid of it.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.640]   And I can.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.960]   I can trade in my clunker domain name
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.320]   if I bought it on a hover.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.120]   Get all the money I spent in hover back.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.800]   So when you search for domains at hover domains,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.960]   it were previously purchased or available for sale.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   Come up in the search results with those stars.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.960]   You could purchase those domain names
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.680]   anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.320]   And you can trade in your old clunkers@hovered.com.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.960]   If you want to upgrade your domain,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   they'll credit you with everything you spend
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.760]   on your old clunker with hover,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.560]   including the original registration fee
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.960]   and any renewal fees.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.080]   That is pretty cool.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.280]   I like that idea.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.200]   Because we all have clunker domain names.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.240]   I have lots of those.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.040]   Yes.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.320]   I have a large collection.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.400]   I get the updates.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.160]   And I'm like, really?
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.320]   Why did I do that?
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   But then you don't want to give it up.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   Transfers, if you've got existing domains,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.920]   only $10 and you get an additional year,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.320]   so it's a very good deal.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   They even have a transfer concierge service.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   Mention you heard this on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   They'll do that for you for free, I believe.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   They still do that.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   The concierge transfer transfer is great.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.320]   Is that concierge that helps you get it out of register?
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   Yeah, you could do it.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   If you're on some other domain host,
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   you can get out of it with a lot of clicking.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   In fact, I keep screwing it up,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   so I keep getting my domain locked.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   I have a couple that are--
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.320]   Go, Daddy, locks it if you start doing it.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   And then it's like, well, you can have it in three months.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   What?
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Right.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   So I learn my lesson.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   Normally, it's $25 for as many domains as you want to transfer.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   But I believe they waive that fee if you call them
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   and say you're coming in from Macbreak.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   1-866-731-6556.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   It's at Macbreak.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   I'm going to call them and tell them I'm coming in from Macbreak.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   I still have some that are--
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   Let them do it.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   It's so nice.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   They just do it all.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   And it's like, let them deal with that and all the weirdness.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   And let's see, what else should I tell you about this?
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   Oh, they have that no hold policy
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   when you call them during business hours.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   They're customer service hours are Monday through Friday,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   When you call them at those times,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.320]   they-- once you get a live person,
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   they will not put you on hold.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   And 10% off when you use a code Macbreak to check out.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.320]   Can we make this any more sexy and hot and desirable?
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   Use the poll.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   [laughter]
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   Use the poll in the oven.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   Use the poll in the oven.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   And it was a show title.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   [laughter]
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   Macbreak.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   That hover.com.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   Let's see here.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   So I guess one story that's kind of germane to us
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   is that the T-Mobile merger of AT&T is dead.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   We talked about this on Sunday,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   and Neelite was saying, yeah, you know,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   I don't even understand what they're doing.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   The FCC has already said no.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   And so they said, okay, well,
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   we withdraw our application FCC.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   And, you know, technically they withdrew it
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   before they said no.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   But it's like-- and talk about--
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I think that isn't the cost, like, $4 billion.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   $4 billion cancellation.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   There's $3 billion in cash in a billion in spectrum
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   that goes to Deutsche Telekom
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   if that doesn't happen, and so it didn't happen.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   And in fact, Neelite said-- I don't even--
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   Neelite, who's the lawyer, right, on Sunday said,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   you know, this whole thing doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   Why are they pursuing this with the Department of Justice
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   in the courts?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   He said even AT&T in their filings couldn't really explain it.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   And he was right.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   It's dead.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   But what happens to T-Mobile now?
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   I mean, they're really just a lame duck, aren't they?
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   With $4 billion more than they had before.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Well, they were lame-dunked before.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   Now they have $4 billion in their lame duck.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   I'd rather have the $4 billion.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   I actually like having T-Mobile around because that's the sim
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   that I put into all the unlocked Android phones that like the--
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   Yeah, I have to say that, you know, I--
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   So I have different devices that have Verizon
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   AT&T and Sprint.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   I don't have a T-Mobile one.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   Sprint is such a joke.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   I mean, you know, like, OK, so the thing is,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   it's like, how are these guys still in business?
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   You know, I'm in Washington, D.C., and it tells me
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   I'm on data roaming.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   Like, I get this data roaming message on my Android,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   on my Galaxy.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   I'm like, I'm in the-- I understand data roaming, like,
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   in Canada, and Canada, Europe.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   Well, you're apparently--
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   Well, I'm in--
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   I mean--
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   I mean, it doesn't have a Washington, D.C. Act.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   I was like, I'm in-- it's not like I'm in the country.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   You know, and, you know, I mean, I'm--
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   Anyway, I just-- I don't understand how those guys are still in business.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   That's all I have to say.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   You know, the interesting story here is-- and somebody in the chat room just said this--
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   T-Mobile is expanding its frequencies to include iPhone compatible frequencies.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   They're the one carrier in the U.S. that doesn't have the iPhone.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   Maybe that's a sign that they will be getting.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Doesn't matter.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   Don't do it.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.320]   Like, like, if you're-- let's say the show, don't use Sprint.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   I mean, you know, the thing is, is I don't care what--
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   I was talking about T-Mobile.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   No, T-Mobile, I'm sorry.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   You really hate them, don't you?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.320]   I'm so angry.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   I'm so angry that I could have gotten your only phone.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320]   You didn't bring any--
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   No, I have an iPhone.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   I mean, you know, but--
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   You're being unfair.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Remember that Sprint was the first telecom company to fully invest in WebOS
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   and to turn it into the telecom-- the title of that is right now.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   That's true.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   And without that respect for innovation and novelty,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   we would have one less phone to left with.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   But I have-- I have--
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   I'm actually scared because I'm going somewhere.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   Tonight, that I called ahead.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.320]   They say, oh, no, you can't use your cell phone here.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   The entire town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, I said Verizon, no.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   Sprint, no, AT&T, no, T-Mobile, no cell phone works.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   How could a town-- how could a town in this country, in this day and age,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.320]   actually have no cell phone access?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   They said you have to go to the edge of town to use your cell phone.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   Why fine?
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   You got-- Stockbridge is definitely a town that would think,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   build a big, ugly tower in the middle of our beautiful world.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.320]   No.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   Well, no, we're not even going to-- and we're also a godless healer,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   so we don't have any church steeples into which to install--
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   cell repeaters, so.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   So one of the questions I have is-- so FaceTime is all fine and dandy,
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   but why does an apple just allow us to make phone calls?
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   I know.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   You know, because the thing is that-- so we were in--
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   Well, can't you use Skype?
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   You can use Skype online.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   Yeah, you can use Skype, but you just-- I just want to be able to--
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   anybody who has an iPhone, you know, so like my daughter went to Tokyo with me.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   What a nice idea.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   I don't know how to-- I don't know how to do this.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   I don't know how to do this.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   I don't know how to do this.

[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   I'll sort that out.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.280]   That's reflected in the comment that they made, which is a reiteration of what they've
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   said over and over again.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.200]   Let me see if I can scroll down and the new lines article.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.280]   This is at theverge.com.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.600]   Apple's response was, "We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.400]   their own original technology, not steel ours."
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.280]   When you use a loaded phrase like steel, that's exactly what you're saying.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   That's like, "Meh!"
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.720]   Well, that cut my to.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:42.120]   It almost seems as though that's a keyboard macro that Steve himself programmed last year,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.840]   and they're still going by the same keyboard macro system.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:52.200]   Do you think an larger note that Apple will change in some of this scorched earth philosophy
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:59.600]   with Steve gone that perhaps Tim Cook and others might say, "Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   do this."
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.280]   Or will they just say, "You know, Steve started it.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   We got to finish it."
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.920]   Well, I'm not sure if they will.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.680]   Realize that this wasn't something that was started two or three months ago.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.400]   This was the long end of a long process.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.960]   It started when was it two years ago?
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.520]   It started a while ago.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.840]   So I think we'll get our answer maybe a year and a half or two years from now.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.280]   I just can't see Apple deciding that this is a productive avenue for them to pursue.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.440]   Again, there's large problems that they can attack legally.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:38.400]   These small things are just when you're exactly one percentage point ahead of the number two
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.080]   provider and you're making razor slim margins so that every 10,000 units you sell is going
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.320]   to define whether you have a good quarter or a bad quarter.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.120]   Yes, this is the sort of stuff that you do.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.320]   This is not the sort of stuff you do when you're making so many billions and billions
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.960]   and billions of dollars every single year when you're just hammering the profitability,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.360]   every other consumer electronics manufacturer, not just in your product categories, but every
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.360]   product categories.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:08.080]   But I think if you drop a penny at lands in a sewer, you don't lay on your belly and
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.560]   get out gum on a string and try to get that penny out of the sewer.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   It's not.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.520]   But I think that Apple pissed.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.080]   I think also Apple has seen this before and it was in the 80s.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.000]   So the thing is, is they've seen this thing where someone else comes in with another operating
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.080]   system copies a lot of their ideas and then eventually takes over a market that they theoretically
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.080]   own.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.000]   A large portion of that was because they let Steve go and then they're in a situation
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.640]   where they didn't have any real leadership.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:40.520]   But the point is that I think that they're going to fight tooth and nail specifically
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.280]   because of their history.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.640]   And I think that's part of their DNA is that in the 80s they had the lead and they lost
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.680]   it to another company.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.720]   And I don't think that they're going to use every avenue.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.960]   Because the problem is the legal costs for Apple to do this are, you know, a rounding
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   error in their income.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.560]   So they can just keep this running for the next 10 years and they wouldn't notice it.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.320]   So I think that's why most likely will continue to throw matches at that fire.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.480]   So the Apple rumor of the week coming up in just a moment, this is the best rumor ever.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.920]   Just the best rumor ever.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.680]   Just love it.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   And it comes from no less than the New York Times, so it's got to be true.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:30.280]   We'll also talk about Apple's big $400 million acquisition and a lot more.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.680]   But right now I'd like to talk a little bit about Ford, Boater company.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:40.840]   We got a great look at last week at some great Ford automobiles, the Focus, the Fiesta,
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.440]   somebody, not me, got to drive the 2012 Mustang.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   Did you drive it?
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.440]   No, I was out of the country.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.600]   I never even saw it.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   It was here for four days and it was just like it was gone.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   I think they should send it back so that we can continue to do it.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.840]   One of the things I got to do was take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus and the My Ford Touch
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.600]   and this new thing called Sync Services.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   Let's take a look.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.920]   Hey, it's Leo LaPort here for this week in tech.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.680]   You know, you've heard me talking about my 2010 Ford Mustang and how much I love Ford Sync.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.320]   The folks at Ford have just let me the new 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   Sweet car.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.440]   This has got My Ford Touch as well as the Ford Sync and some really nice new features,
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.800]   including Wi-Fi.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.680]   It's got the Ford services, Sync Services and app link, which allows me to play apps
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   right from my phone.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.280]   I thought I'd take you for a little ride and show you some of the things it could do.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   Come on.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   Let me just show you this screen.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.840]   I usually keep it on this, the home screen.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.600]   You see all of this stuff here very easily, but the point is not to look at the screen
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   or even touch the screen.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.280]   The point is you're driving down the road.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.640]   You want to keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road, but I want to, let's
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.680]   say, find somewhere I'm going to go.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.440]   So I press this paddle here.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.960]   That's the signal to get Sync to listen to me.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   Listen.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.720]   Street address.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.080]   In California, say a street address, including the city.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.400]   One four zero Keller Street, Petaluma.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.920]   That's the Twitbrick house.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.800]   Say a line number.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.600]   One.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.400]   So again, I haven't touched the screen.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   I haven't done anything.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.800]   You don't actually even have to look at the screen.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.200]   I'm going to press this button, set his destination.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   Setting destination.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.560]   And we're on our way.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.560]   But let's say we're lost.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.560]   We want to go somewhere.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:31.920]   I have a destination POI.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.680]   By name or by category?
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.680]   By name.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.840]   POI name.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.160]   Jack in the box.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   I was hungry.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.760]   So now it's going to find some onion rings in the boxes, but there's a number of them.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.280]   So I could pick which one I want.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.080]   Please choose.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Line one.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.080]   You do have to look to see the line.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.160]   Set his destination.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:00.960]   Setting new destination.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   And then the music comes back.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.840]   Now we've got a map and it's going to walk me through it and we're on our way to Jack
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.840]   in the box.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.000]   The route guidance will start now.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Thank you.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   She's so pleasant.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.480]   I've wanted to do this for a while.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.720]   Just kind of show you how it works.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.440]   Now I had the full voice prompts on that one, but you can actually turn the voice prompts
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   off and they're much shorter.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   You get to do it.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.080]   As you get used to it, you need less car with that.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   That was the focus.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.120]   That's the gas focus, but I'm going to get the electric focus as soon as those are out,
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.440]   which is I think they started building them this week.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   Last week they started building them.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.440]   So I'm very excited.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:47.120]   Anyway, take a look at Ford's amazing technology in their cars by going to Ford.com/technology.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.840]   You know the best way to do this.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.200]   Drive a 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.160]   Drive one, the Ford dealer near you.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.520]   We thank Ford for your other support.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.920]   I'm so excited I'm going to have a dinner with Ellen Malawi.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.600]   By the way, Eileen, we got to talk because that's during showstoppers.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   I'm going to have to rearrange my...
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.040]   I already arranged it.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.040]   I could do a PEPCOM.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.040]   We'll figure that out.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   We'll figure it out.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   Sarah's going to cover for you now.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   Is she?
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.400]   You know, when the CEO of Ford says, "Would you like to have dinner?"
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   You can't really say...
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.040]   You can't say no.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.440]   No.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.880]   Even if they weren't a sponsor, I would say yes, because that's kind of a treat.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:26.280]   Offer to pick them up in your 10-year-old, like a foreign car.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   They might say, "We can do...
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.080]   Oh, Leo, we have to do better for you than this.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.840]   You shouldn't be driving a Subaru."
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.080]   I just want everybody to know.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.400]   I bought my Mustang.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   I did not use a friends and family discount.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.240]   I actually went to the dealer.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.560]   I didn't even haggle.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.160]   I just said, "What do you want?"
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.440]   I'm so bad at that.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.720]   I just said, "Here, I'll take it."
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.240]   I love that Mustang.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.040]   I love that Mustang, baby.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   So this is...
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:58.560]   First, let's talk about Anno Bit, which is a company that an Israeli flash memory company
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.760]   that Apple is buying for.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   We've heard the rumor for a while, but now it's true for, I think, almost half a billion
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   dollars.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.040]   They don't make the flash.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   They design them right.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.040]   They're researching.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.640]   The fabulous chip designer.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.680]   They don't actually make them.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.920]   They design them.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:19.960]   They will set up a semiconductor development center in Israel where Anno Bit is located.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:26.160]   Anno Bit designed components are used on both the iOS devices and the MacBook Air.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:32.120]   They have something called memory signal processing, which makes flash memory more reliable.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.120]   They don't use...
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.760]   It's not DRAM, it's NAND flash.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:41.280]   I guess it's used on the solid-state drives and the flash RAM and the iOS devices.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.520]   That's cool.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.120]   To get a little bit more technical, because I know we have a pretty technical audience,
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:55.880]   we've talked before about something called TRIM.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.560]   There isn't fragmentation doesn't happen on SSDs in the way that it happens on spinning
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   drives because SSDs, the data is actually distributed all over.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.320]   There is no access time.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.160]   It's instant access.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.760]   Full of awesomeness is what it is.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.680]   That's one of the reasons it's very fast.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.800]   There is a problem that happens with SSDs in terms of as you use the drive, they do slow
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   down a little bit.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.640]   I actually talked to two guys at Intel last year at CES who work in the flash hard drives.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.720]   The Intel makes the best SSDs.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.040]   Two guys, and they disagreed.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.640]   One said, "Oh yeah, you should have TRIM so that you don't have this slowdown."
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.400]   The other said, "It's such a minor slowdown.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.040]   It doesn't matter."
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.720]   Even experts who make these things disagree about the importance of TRIM.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.680]   TRIM is in many controllers on solid-state drives.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.000]   By using the TRIM command, it has to be in the operating system.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   You can keep the drive at full speed even after you use it over time.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.160]   It's like fragmentation, but it's not the same idea.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:04.080]   OS 10L does have TRIM, but this MSP technology makes it unnecessary.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.040]   This is an article in Apple Insider.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:17.880]   MSP technology, on the firmware level, monitors flash memory cells to eliminate bad cells,
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.080]   which isn't exactly what TRIM does.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.160]   Apparently, according to Apple Insider, this means TRIM is less important.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.320]   It makes components faster.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.360]   It enables data to be pushed to flash memory at speeds that generate more errors but can
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.880]   correct the errors.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.280]   That's kind of cool.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.040]   You can get cheaper SSDs because you use cheaper RAM.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.320]   You can use flash memory in things like phones where price points are critical, cheaper MLC
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.040]   memory instead of the higher quality SLC RAM.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.640]   Alan Melvatano is the guy to ask.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.280]   I'm sure he'll have something to say about this on this weekend computer hardware on
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280]   Twitch.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:03.200]   Meanwhile, that's my layman explanation of Anobit and why this is a smart acquisition
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   for Apple.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.040]   I think it's very clear, and after reading the Isaacson book, I got it, that Apple really
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.160]   doesn't like having third-party suppliers.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.160]   If they start with that, they start with working with you.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.200]   The trajectory is that if we like you and we're going to continue to use you, we're
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.760]   going to buy you.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   It makes me wonder why Apple doesn't, well, actually Steve did in the early days have
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   his own factories even.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   Remember that?
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.360]   They made the Macintosh.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.000]   They made the Lisa.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.320]   There's that anecdote about how the Lisa plant, he wanted to paint all the machines and there's
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.600]   a blue machine that broke all the time because he had a painted blue.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.840]   It's like funny anecdote.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.040]   Rumor of anyway, that's that's-
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.840]   But I think you get into a situation like Foxconn where Apple, you know, making it for a lot
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.360]   of other people and Apple pushing their technology forward by asking them to do certain things.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.480]   Makes them better at serving HTC and other folks as well.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.800]   I think Apple doesn't like to do that.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.320]   Well, that's a good point, right?
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   Now Foxconn is better.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.800]   I guess it depends on the part because they've had success in monopolizing the output of certain
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.840]   factories so tightly that it makes it almost impossible for somebody to create another product
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.400]   that uses the same techniques.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.200]   If you look at what's been happening with the Intel UltraBook lines, they're most of
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.040]   them aren't made out of like milled components.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.880]   They're not like you know, body frame components because the manufacturing capacity to make
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.800]   hundreds and hundreds and thousands of these devices is largely supposedly monopolized
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.920]   by Apple that they don't have the manufacturer Samsung and Asus and the rest don't have access
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.800]   to that kind of manufacturing.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.520]   There have been times when a certain critical part that pretty much every phone manufacturer
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.320]   is using is being tied up.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.960]   Apple bought so many of them so far in advance and locked in those contracts so firmly that
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.320]   just to ensure that everybody who wants an iPhone can get one, they assured that other
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.600]   people who want to make a smaller run of a different phone are probably going to have
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.280]   to wait two years before they find a spot in the production schedule.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.240]   So it's a complicated dance.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:13.040]   Well to that point, Apple is now completely monopolizing Samsung's new factory in Austin.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.600]   Samsung just completed a $3.6 billion factory in Austin that does one thing only.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.280]   It makes A5 chips for Apple period.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.880]   That just went into production.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   It's a 1.6 million square feet factory.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:34.160]   It's fully owned by Samsung but they built it to make the A5 which is used only by Apple.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.320]   So that just shows you.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:41.040]   Apple's Apple by so much that even if a third party's making it in effect, that's an Apple
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.040]   factory right?
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.280]   Also, I wonder how much this simplifies and speeds along their manufacturing process.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.800]   The fact that now to get this component around, how does it change the fact that now they
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.520]   have this main plant in Texas, where do these chips then have to go in order to assemble
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.720]   that iPads?
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.240]   And does that make things, does the fact that they can get things certified and checked
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.440]   out within the United States make it easier and faster or the fact that this thing has
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.800]   to then be shipped half across the world to be put into an iPad and shipped all the way
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.680]   back to China, don't they?
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.880]   It would have been faster to make in Korea.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.520]   I have to think it's something to do with the tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.800]   that maybe they feel like we ought to have something somewhere else.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.520]   Are you guys having as much trouble buying hard drives as we are?
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   No, are you?
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Well, you buy a lot of hard drives.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   We go through a couple of terabytes.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.720]   I think we stocked up a few months ago.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.880]   We have like a thousand hard drives in the base.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.400]   I feel like I order them every day because Amazon only let me buy like three at a time.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   So I'm just kind of like, okay, I'll just keep every day.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   We buy three.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.880]   Perfect Facebook radio is pointing out that actually there is a big iPad factory now in
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.520]   Brazil as well.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.040]   And so maybe they're just sending them to Brazil.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.960]   But you think about this, this makes sense.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.880]   Apple is distributing its production.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.720]   It's big enough now that they can build a factory in Brazil, a factory in Japan, a factory
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:02.040]   in China, a factory in Austin and just distribute it.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.880]   That's another Foxconn factory in Brazil though, isn't it?
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.400]   Yeah, it's owned by Foxconn.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.320]   I think Tim Cook is the genius here.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.480]   There's no question about it.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.560]   And Tim has probably figured all, you know, he's got all the spreadsheets to say, it's
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.120]   much better Foxconn owns it, but we dominate.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.640]   Well, the other thing is, is that you're basically by spreading it around, you often
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.160]   are leveraging your relationships with those individual countries when it comes to tax
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.800]   breaks and all kinds of other pieces and saying, well, we can bring this to you, but
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.600]   we're going to get X, Y and Z, which can end up saving you hundreds of millions or billions
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   of dollars.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:41.240]   And then we're going to get to the next time by simply twisting the local governments to
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.680]   allow them to, to, you know, to...
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.780]   Well, and remember there was an explosion a couple of days ago, right, the Pegatron
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.560]   plan in Shanghai.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.720]   That makes not just Apple stuff, but does make a...
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720]   I don't know what they make.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.560]   Let me check.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:07.040]   What the 60 workers were injured, it's operated by RIT, ENG, computer accessory, HP and Asus
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.200]   also make stuff there.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.880]   The company was in the middle of a trial production of an aluminum iPad 2 back panels when the
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.120]   explosion happened on December 17th.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.520]   It was at the particle collecting equipment.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   Yikes.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   Do you guys, what do you guys think of the other persistent rumors that workers are mistreated
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.520]  ?
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.280]   I think that suicide stat was bogus because there's so many workers at the Foxconn factories
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.880]   that you'd expect a certain percentage.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.360]   That's not abnormal.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:46.600]   But do you feel like Apple is responsive to those kinds of complaints that they do a
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.560]   good job of protecting the workers, the international workers working on Apple products?
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.080]   I think the workers in other countries probably don't have the same creature comforts that
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.680]   workers in the United States have.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.080]   I think that they're probably much better than most of the other factories in their
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   given country.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080]   But I don't think it's the same.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.960]   Is it unfair to compare their salaries, their conditions to American workers and salaries
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   and conditions?
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   I think it is.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.200]   I think you have to look at it.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.560]   I think you have to look at it from a relative perspective.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.400]   That you are providing a lot of opportunity there and obviously it's not going to...
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.920]   That is their advantage is that it's cheaper.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.440]   They wouldn't be employed otherwise.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:30.920]   I do think that Apple does, especially after the suicides, I think Apple sent people over,
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:36.760]   was doing a lot of work on trying to make sure that it is as they try to improve the
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.120]   situation.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.880]   But I do think that it is difficult in those countries.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.760]   Also Apple can't divorce themselves from responsibility of what the workers are experiencing because
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.240]   in so many other industries, other manufacturers can say, "Well, really, what can we do?
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.080]   There's limited capability.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.640]   We're just contracting this stuff out."
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.480]   Apple is such a prime mover for the success of these individual companies that if they
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.120]   simply said, "From now on, everybody gets an American style of living.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.720]   Everybody gets full health benefits.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.920]   Everybody gets retirement fund.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.040]   They would have to at least sit down and at least negotiate them down to something better
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.840]   but not quite up to that level."
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.960]   Well, in the iPad, it's also $1,000.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   Exactly.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.000]   We're culpable in the sense that we put the pressure on Apple to keep the price down and
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.480]   that's how you do it.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.480]   Yes.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.760]   But the point is that if I think Apple has wisely never stepped completely back away from responsibility
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.240]   for the working conditions there, they can't, I think they're smart enough to know that
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.760]   they can't just throw up their hands and say, "Well, we have nothing to do with that.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.160]   We just contract this out.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.560]   We have no, there's nothing we could do and therefore our hands are kind of tied there."
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:54.760]   It does make me think though about, I think it's a good thing that Apple's moving some
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.960]   of their manufacturing into the United States.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.800]   But sometimes I worry about when a part of the country becomes a factory town for one
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.360]   industry or one company, it doesn't take a long time for somebody of that company to
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.440]   start thinking, "Gosh, we can, things would move so much easier for us if this regulation
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:21.360]   will relax just a little bit."
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.160]   All they have to do is simply communicate that, "Well, the reason why we move this
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.480]   factor to your district is because we're able to do things profitably and efficiently for
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   ourselves."
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.760]   This pesky little regulation that we're dealing with makes it more difficult for us
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.720]   to keep these thousands of jobs in your district end of message.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.280]   The Congressman who just wants to make sure the things are okay for the people that he
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.600]   works for would then start to maybe put more pressure to ease off this regulation, this
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.080]   rule, this concept that would affect the rest of the country.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.600]   So I don't believe that Apple's a sort of company that would do things that are necessarily
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.080]   bad or evil.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.240]   But that's always something that's in the back of my sick, twisted, black, bitter, little
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.560]   cynical mind.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:08.000]   Every time I start, for every good side that, "Oh, for every good side to bring 5,000 jobs
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.320]   in," that's 5,000 hostages that you have in this congressional district.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.400]   And that's a lot of pressure as soon as you start to, even if it is legitimately in your
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.520]   company's best interest to close that plant, that's a big, big responsibility you have.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.040]   And a lot of danger you could create just by accident.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.840]   And I just want to, I mean, we work hard.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.200]   We're building training facilities in Africa right now in Rwanda.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.240]   We just got funded.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:40.120]   And we're working to make sure that those working conditions are really good, actually.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.960]   But one of the things to, if people are upset about the way things are being done in China,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.560]   then check every box that you buy and every piece of clothing or whatever.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.640]   No, don't buy anything from China.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.720]   If you really believe that, don't go to Walmart.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   Don't buy anything out of Walmart.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.520]   Don't buy anything out of Kmart.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.560]   And the thing is, is that people are very good at being holier than now until they go
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.240]   shopping and then they want to save some money and they go to Walmart.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.040]   You know, that's what, you know, and you are paying for that.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.400]   And you just have to remember as a consumer that, you know, it's not just these corporations.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.240]   When you, when you decide that you're going to buy stuff from Walmart, you are voting,
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.400]   that that is okay with you.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.040]   Yeah, which makes me sad because I don't think we could do any of the shows that we do if
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.240]   we stopped buying things from China.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.080]   Well, it's a very, it's a very like young, I won't say young.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.600]   I would say juvenile instead response to say that there's a binary, you have a binary
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.600]   responsibility that you're either doing 100% good or 100% bad.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.200]   And so if you're not actually employing somebody to polish the insides of shell casings with
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.320]   tiny, tiny little children's hands for one cent per week, then you must be a wonderful,
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.480]   wonderful person.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.880]   That said, it's always good to have an awareness of the cost that oftentimes comes into play
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.960]   by every single consumer choice that we make.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.320]   We do things at a large scale.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.160]   We do things on a small scale.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.640]   So long as you're always responsible for that one piece of trash that you have an opportunity
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.560]   to pick up and put in your pocket and make the world a fraction of a better place, I
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.960]   think you're responsible to do that.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.680]   Even if you were going to acknowledge that you haven't, you're not a saint, you just
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.160]   picked up one thing, you didn't solve the entire problem, but at least by thinking a
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.120]   little bit harder and doing at least the least you can do, you can have an effect that if
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.200]   everybody decided to act that way would create a much, much better place on earth.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.280]   It's so tempting to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and say, "Well, since I can't
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.040]   fix it, I give up."
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.240]   Well, when I say something, and by the way, I want to say that, I'm not saying not to
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   shop at Walmart.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.480]   I'm not saying not to make stuff at Walmart.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:45.280]   Because what I'm saying is that if you really believe that, then you shouldn't be
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280]   shopping.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.480]   You should be paying attention to everything.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:53.720]   I look at it as what tends to happen is that when success happens, development happens
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720]   behind it.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.800]   The thing is that what you're looking at, there's a huge problem in China right now as far as
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.920]   riots and people getting upset.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.520]   That is being created by all of this success because you're having basically a separation
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.200]   where people are getting left behind.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.840]   The old systems that things are becoming more transparent, the old systems aren't working.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.040]   So the actual what's actually happening over a long period of time, I think is going to
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.640]   positively affect the Chinese workers.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   I hope so.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.320]   Well, because they're getting upset because they're starting to see more of that.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.720]   We see the air quality Beijing.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.080]   Yeah, yeah, it's terrible.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:33.720]   So the thing is that those are, those things will over time, but it's not going to be immediate.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.720]   Right.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.960]   So moving along, enough do good or stuff.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.120]   Let's talk more about cool gadgets.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.600]   Apparently, Wolfram Alpha has been enlisted to make Siri smarter about buying products.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.240]   I'm going to try this before.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.040]   So I'm going to try this right now.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.440]   I phones.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.200]   So we have the over the headshot.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   We do.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.920]   Oh, see, that's not what I wanted.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.240]   Apparently, Wolfram Alpha is incorporating best by...
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.040]   I move your hand.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.600]   Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out what can I, what can the question be that will get this
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.720]   to work?
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   iPhone availability.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:21.320]   Great.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:27.960]   Well, Apple Siri can now shop for electronics by voice using Wolfram Alpha according to
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.480]   this report on Apple Insider.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.000]   Let me just say Apple iPhones.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.960]   Apple iPhones.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:44.080]   Yeah, see, it's just getting me stores.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.480]   Somehow you can get Wolfram Alpha to tell you what models they are, what prices there
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480]   are.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.440]   I mean, this is pretty cool.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.040]   How do I do that though?
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Okay, look it.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   Here's a search.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.840]   Let's try this one.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.840]   Lightest digital camera under $100 with a pixel resolution greater than 12 megapixels.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.920]   If that works, I'm going to be blown away.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920]   Actually, I tried doing that and that didn't work.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.080]   However, it worked if I said, how much does an iPhone cost?
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.840]   Ah, that's the search I'm doing.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.280]   Let me see if we can get it on camera.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.560]   Hello, Mr. Zumi.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560]   There you go.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   Enjoy my Apple.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.400]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400]   Focus.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   Focus.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   Focus.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   Focus.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400]   Zoom in.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.400]   Focus.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400]   Focus.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400]   Zoom.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   Ah, come on.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400]   I get the idea.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   Probably because I'm not okay.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.960]   Well, I will then give you the audiobook.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.800]   There maybe you can see that a little bit better.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.040]   This is only audio.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:46.600]   There's a Wolfham Alpha that says, median is $6.99.99, highest is $899.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.760]   That's cool.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.480]   The lowest is $79.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:56.840]   parentheses, Apple iPhone 3G with 8 gigabytes of memory, regular price rankings from 1 to
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:05.560]   32, model by model, Apple iPhone 4, specifically 4 gigs, white 899, 64 gigs with black 899,
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.120]   zooming down, down, down.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.120]   Currency conversions too.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   That would be 535 euros, 447.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   Wow.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   That's nice.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.120]   Wow.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.360]   It's almost $10,000 in pesos.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.560]   I don't know why you put the dollar sign in front of this.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.360]   Is peso a simple dollar sign?
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360]   Anyway.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   You know what?
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360]   Here's why I mentioned it.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.280]   I think this is encouraging because it was showing is that Apple is increasing the capabilities
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.080]   of Siri, that it isn't a considered a canned thing.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.400]   This is what Siri does.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   They're done.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.280]   And I hope that they continue to do this at a faster clip, frankly, than they're doing
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.080]   because the smarter and smarter Siri is.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.400]   I think they were clear that this was the beginning.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   You know, that they were--
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   Yeah, but it's not.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.120]   But it's the beginning, but it's been out for how long and how much has changed, right?
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   But also--
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   And it doesn't work--
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.040]   Also, it works half the time, which is another issue that's got to be resolved.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.360]   Another part of the question is if they're doing this with partners like Wolf of Malefra,
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.400]   how much is this Wolf of Malefra's ability to simply turn on the taps on certain other
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.040]   features or striking deals?
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.040]   The article mentions that they use Best Buy prices, so this is a deal with Best Buy.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.600]   It's not that these give you links to where you can buy it on Best Buy.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.680]   And if they're going to choose how to implement this, they have to choose a store or a bunch
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.080]   of stores anyway, so that's not quite so bad.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.640]   But I wonder if the way that these services are integrated with Siri is such that if they
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.360]   wanted to simply say, you know what?
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   I think that we're going to go with Walmart now.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.000]   We're going to use Walmart as our price index for anything that involves a TV set, because
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   they've made us a better deal to put their pricing into--
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.680]   That makes it less useful, frankly.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.200]   But I wonder if Apple has that kind of control.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   You'll put the two cool.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.680]   I bet they do.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.840]   Hey, Santa is using Siri.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   They better get working.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840]   Here's the latest iPhone 4s.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.840]   Should probably play it since I have audio.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.840]   Oh, you should play it.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840]   I don't have audio, do I?
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   Here we go.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   [MUSIC]
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.840]   How do I get to Charlie Graham's house?
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.400]   Here are directions to Charlie Grant's house.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.320]   Is it cold in Santa Fe?
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   Raleigh.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   Cleveland tonight?
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   Raleigh.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.320]   Really cold, down to about 14 degrees.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.640]   Find that email with an audio or an iceless.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.600]   New message from Mrs. Claus.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.160]   Go easy on the cookies.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160]   [LAUGH]
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.560]   How does the rest of my day look?
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.520]   You have 3.7 billion appointments.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.080]   Good one.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   That's the best part.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   That's a cute ad.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   I like that.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.880]   Little timely ad.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:40.720]   All right, here's the Apple rumor of the week I love this rumor and I hope that is true.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   Let me pull it up.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.880]   There's going to be an Apple TV.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.440]   Well, the New York Times did this article.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   Was it the Times?
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   I think it was Wall Street Journal.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   Oh, the journal.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.920]   That really didn't say anything that we didn't already knew.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   I don't even understand what the whole point is.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.280]   It's them stating this is now on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.040]   Apple execs have discussed the future of TV with major media companies.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.360]   Not said we're going to do anything, not trying to make any deals.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   Just what do you think?
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.800]   What's the future of TV?
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.880]   So I'm not that excited.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:16.120]   Now the Times, on the other hand, says, I find this bizarre.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:21.080]   Apple is secretly working on wearable, Siri compatible computers.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:26.960]   Apple, according to the New York Times, has a prototype, a curved glass iPod that would
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   wrap around the wrist.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:32.360]   You could interact with your voice.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.760]   I'm sure this is just like blue-skying, right?
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   Maybe not.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.160]   Nick Bilton wrote the article.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.720]   He says, Google also is working on wearable computers that could connect to Android.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.720]   I see a lawsuit.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.520]   Somebody who got there first.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   Who got there first?
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   What?
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   That's it?
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   He's got it.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   It's a nano.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.520]   No, I mean, it's such a, it's such a, it sounds like a non-story the way it was written because
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.720]   Apple already has wearable computers.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.280]   They can clip on anything.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.160]   It's also such a low profile that you can embed them into wrist watches and jewelry
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.400]   and stuff like that.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.520]   It certainly makes sense for them to create, to add a voice, it adds a Siri or Siri-like
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.520]   functionality to devices that don't have really good keyboards.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.880]   Thirdly, it makes perfect sense for, there's another part of the article that talks about
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.800]   using these wearable devices to communicate with the iPhone and give you another point
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.560]   of accessibility to it.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.860]   That's another kind of a no-brainer because the whole point of every Apple product is for
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.960]   Apple to sell you another Apple product.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.240]   So if you already have an iPhone and someone tells you, by the way, there's this little
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.680]   workout gear so that you can keep your iPhone or wrist watch, wrist watch able the iPod
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.320]   Nano now so that you can keep your iPhone in your pocket and instantly see exactly who's
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.680]   calling without doing anything.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.200]   You could actually scroll through iOS notifications through this without taking your phone out
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   of your pocket.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.720]   You can transfer the call to your headset all without fiddling around with your iPhone.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.760]   If they did that in the standard $150 Nano, they wouldn't have to create a brand new wearable
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.920]   computer.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.880]   It's just like...
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.640]   As Nick points out, in a way, an iPhone is a wearable computer.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.600]   I'm wearing it right here.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.720]   Although it would be great from a workout perspective.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.720]   That's what I think a lot of people use those NANOs for, and being able to have it on your
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:22.520]   wrist and being able to...I think Siri makes more sense for a wrist device than it does
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.200]   for the iPhone in a lot of ways.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   Apple really wouldn't...
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.680]   I don't think they would come out with a device that specifically here is a scarf, but it's
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:36.360]   also...it also plays a AACs.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.200]   I have to admit that I was...
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.640]   Although that would be great, the iPod scarf.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.320]   Yes, the...
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.560]   It's like Apple's giving you a hug.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.200]   It's like...no, no, more like...
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.200]   Apple's slightly built.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.560]   Apple's literally now has a stranglehold around your neck with its locked in technology.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.400]   Why not make it official?
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400]   Apple's slightly changed.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.880]   Do I want it in Gryffindor or...?
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.760]   Or Whivren.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.960]   But yeah, I got him in there.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   I was wrong last year when they came up with a redesigned Nano, the color touchscreen Nano.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.440]   I was wrong because I was just seeing it as a clip on iPod.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.080]   But I failed to...I didn't take a step back and realize that what you have is this wafer
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.520]   theme, little touchscreen computer that could then be re-articulated in a million different
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.880]   ways by third parties.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.000]   So that's why if Apple were to decide to put a beefier processor inside this device and
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.240]   make it into an iOS device instead of a whatever it is right now device, that could be...that
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:37.280]   could give a lot of people who weren't giving...up to now, haven't given the Nano a second thought,
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:46.320]   looking at G, maybe I should have a MacBook Air and an iPad and an iPhone and iPod Nano.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:52.040]   I'd love just...I hope that five years from now we'll be reading the rumor that Apple
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:57.920]   planning to implant a Nano into my brain with Siri mind reading capabilities.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.400]   That's all I'm looking for.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.400]   Me being like from...like flat muzzle velocity from a rifle or...
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.720]   No, no, no.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.960]   I just want a little socket on the back of my head like they had the matrix.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.000]   Click it right in, that's all I need.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.600]   I think...I remember having a conversation with Scott Bourne, I guess they were doing some
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   research and see how to do it.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]   He was like, "I'm ready, I'm ready."
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.440]   A little clip in the back.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.840]   That guy doing a second.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.040]   So another Apple rumor, seven inch iPad in 2012.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.080]   I think this is bogus, but what do you think?
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.040]   Digitimes is recording.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   No.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   No.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   I think that's...
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.520]   Because they're so scared of the one million, one or two million fires they sold to the
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.680]   sold during the Christmas season.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.240]   How could Apple ever...how could Apple ever ran just selling two million of anything?
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.560]   It's the same as the rumors that Apple would make a netbook, I think, that Apple doesn't
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.800]   need to worry about those markets.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   They don't need to worry about the seven inch market.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.360]   They don't need to worry about the netbook market.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   They just keep doing what they're doing.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.800]   Although it's interesting to think about them maybe doing a new version of the iPod Touch.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   That's maybe a four and a half inch screen.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800]   That's the one...
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.800]   A bigger touch.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.480]   I mean, not even necessarily make it a larger resolution display, but simply say, "We
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.520]   realize that people are using this for gaming.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.800]   We realize that people are using it for e-book reading.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   We decided to make the screen a little bit bigger to make it better for those two things.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.200]   And no longer has to be exactly the same size as an iPhone.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.760]   It would give it a little bit of distinction from the iPhone right now.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.640]   It'd be an interesting thing to do, but that's the only area in which I could ever think
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.120]   of them doing anything with a larger...anything like a seven inch iPad.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.640]   I just don't think that would ever happen.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.640]   I like this one.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.040]   I would run out and buy an Apple rumored to launch a 2880 by 1800 MacBook Pro, a retina
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.440]   display MacBook Pro in the second quarter of 2012.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.280]   For those of us who sit four inches away from the display, that would be a really wonderful
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   advantage.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:47.920]   I think people don't understand that when you get the resolution that high, it doesn't
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.320]   make things bigger.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   It makes them smaller.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:54.200]   Well, it makes them clearer because what they're doing is they'll make all the font
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.000]   sizes bigger and everything else.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.640]   And so they're moving very quickly towards the idea of the look.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.840]   Yeah, I mean, you just make everything twice as big.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.080]   But are we talking about the resolution limits of the human eye?
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:11.440]   I mean, can the human eye really see that difference when you're always sitting a fixed...what's
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.440]   the average difference today about?
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.600]   Maybe a little bit about a foot and a foot and a half.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.880]   How close would you have to sit before you would see that that's a difference between
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   a letter E and a letter O, for instance?
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.520]   Well, but I think I'm looking at my 11 inch air.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.920]   It's 1366 by 768.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.720]   And I can clearly on the rounded corner see that there's pixelation and so on and so
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720]   forth.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:32.720]   That would go away with twice the resolution.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.400]   I mean, it would look like I'm looking at a paper.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.240]   I find that I end up using the Retinitis Play on my iPhone like three inches from my
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.240]   eyes.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.240]   Oh, I can read that.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   That's beautiful.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.320]   Of course, I'm nearsighted, so that works for me.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.080]   But that's what happens to me is you get...
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.080]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.400]   Everything looks crisper.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.720]   But nevertheless, there's this temptation to make fonts smaller.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.840]   You do have to stay within the range.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   Make them bigger.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.400]   I like the idea of everything's crisper, but the same size.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.760]   What I don't like and what tends to happen is everything's...
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.800]   The icons are smaller, the text's smaller, and I feel older.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.320]   I think with the Lebanon share, the movement really should be towards not Apple, but independent
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:18.040]   developers thinking of full screen mode on an 11 inch air almost like an entire different
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040]   OS.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.680]   They'll never get iOS on the MacBook Air.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.000]   But if they simply say that whenever the user is in full screen mode on an 11 inch air,
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.360]   I'm going to essentially assume that I'm developing this for an iPad app.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.800]   So we're going to have big fat buttons.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.000]   We know this is a tiny screen.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.080]   We know that people are still going to be using...
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.080]   Even though the screen is smaller, the keyboard is the same size.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.280]   They're still typing at the same distance.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.640]   So I really think it's a change in philosophy rather than a change in technology that should
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   be coming for that.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:54.560]   I think, by the way, I think never have iOS on a 11 inch air is a big prediction that
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.440]   I wouldn't necessarily agree with.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440]   They might well.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   I don't think...
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   I don't like...
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440]   I don't like to get more iOS-C.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.680]   I think that's the correction we're going.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   I think we're going to...
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   I think well...
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   You said iOS, sir.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.680]   Sir, we have a difference.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.440]   Could the corporate reporter read the transfer?
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.360]   I think three to five years from now, the OS on the iPad and the Air will be almost indistinguishable.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   I don't know about it.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   Whatever they do.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:23.440]   I think that Apple is going to continue to try to find good ideas wherever they can find
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440]   them.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.560]   If they happen to already own those good ideas, all the better, less legal hassles.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   Fewer checks to write.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   Let's see.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.960]   I'm going to move on, I think.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   The Apple hired, by the way, a young guy who has done some videos on how Apple could do
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.160]   multitasking and so forth.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.840]   I love it when you see Apple doing things like that.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.160]   His name is Jan Michael Cart.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.200]   He's the guy who came up with a notification center idea, right?
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.400]   I think it's mostly his notification center work also.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.080]   A hire was an internship.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080]   That's right.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.880]   It's a seven-month internship.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.520]   He's majoring in mass media arts at the University of Georgia, specializing in video and graphic
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.160]   design.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   I think that's great.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:18.960]   I think that's a great idea for getting new ideas into the mix.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.160]   You've got to figure as an intern, they're not going to go.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.360]   Yeah, you can design the notifications.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.760]   He's going to know where all the best coffee shops are.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   Exactly.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760]   Exactly.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.800]   The fastest way to get from Apple campus to there and back.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.160]   The video is pretty good.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:41.280]   It has a lot of real common-sense solutions to a lot of the problems that the notification
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.400]   center still has.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:50.040]   One of them is to put a persistent bullet in the taskbar that says, "Here's how many
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.200]   unread notifications you have."
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.120]   Another one is to treat each app that can put notifications into this system like it's
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.360]   a separate widget so you can have more control over how these apps present themselves, whether
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.720]   or not they present themselves.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.520]   It's certainly prettier.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.160]   It's certainly more interesting.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:12.880]   There's also one feature that I would love to have where if an incoming call comes in,
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:16.720]   instead of taking over your entire screen immediately, his idea is to just make it a
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.200]   notification period or at least have that as an option.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.480]   As you can say, if anybody ever actually calls me on the phone using the phone app, then
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.360]   that's probably a breakdown in communication.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.080]   I do not want my game interrupted by this person.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.880]   Are they foolish?
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.760]   Even if it's Steve Jobs, I want to continue with "Cut the rope."
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.640]   One of those ideas are earth shattering, but I think it's cool that-
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:42.360]   Yeah, but essentially it's also cool that he cut together a video that puts them together
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   extremely well.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   Nice job.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   Yeah, he did a good job.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360]   And it looks very professional.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.960]   If this were a keynote video, you wouldn't think twice about- I don't know, maybe there's
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:56.160]   a couple places where if you would look for things like, "Okay, you see that there is
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.960]   a four and a half bars of signal strength instead of five plus bars, therefore this
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   video fails."
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.360]   All right, time to take a break when we come back.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:09.160]   Our Lion and iOS tip of the weekend, some picks as well, but first time to mention our
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.920]   friends at audible.com, the best.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:19.080]   Number one audio bookstore in the world with 100,000 titles in the US, and of course,
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.660]   stores all over the world, different- because of the way publishing works, different titles
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:27.280]   in different countries, but always a great deal.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.280]   If you're in the US, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.280]   Thank you.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.280]   Thank you.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.280]   Slashbackbreak.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   It says it right there.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   What am I looking for?
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.480]   Audible.com/macbreak, and you can sign up for the gold account.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.480]   That's a book a month.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.840]   Your first month's free, your first book's free, cancel at any time.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.680]   You can keep that book forever.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.120]   And I think that Mr. Innaco has a suggestion for us.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.760]   I have a great suggestion.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:58.640]   It's Patrick Stewart's audiobook version of A Christmas Carol.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.640]   Wow.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.640]   What's here?
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.680]   Do you have a little audio of that?
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680]   Do you have a pull-up?
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.280]   I will pull it up while Andy explains what is-
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.800]   No, I don't want to talk over Mr. Stewart.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:13.480]   Well, I think if you hear five seconds of this-
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.480]   Do you see that?
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   Or Tim Curry.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   I've got it.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.480]   I've got it.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.480]   Here we go.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.480]   Go ahead.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:26.280]   "The language effort not being a man of strong imagination, he failed."
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.720]   "A Merry Christmas, uncle!"
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:33.000]   It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.800]   intimation he had of his approach.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800]   That's good.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.040]   Jean-Luc LePrais reads a Christmas Carol.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.240]   I mean, there's a backstory behind this.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.800]   This was one of- he used to do stage one-man productions of A Christmas Carol with him doing
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:52.080]   every single voice, including the children, including the girls.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.320]   This was even when he was doing Star Trek.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.800]   At some point during the year, he would have a theater book in which he would do his one-man
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.960]   reading or one-man stage production of A Christmas Carol.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:04.920]   Just him in a black suit, not reading from a script because he knows every page of this
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.080]   so intimately.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.640]   I came across this in audio cassette form.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.640]   Wow.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:15.800]   Must have been 10 or 15 years ago and quickly became one of my holiday traditions.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:20.080]   So long as I had a cassette player was to get the box full of stuff that has my Christmas
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.960]   stuff in it, get out the audio book version of A Christmas Carol, put it in the car and
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.840]   pretty much listen to this three or four or five times between Thanksgiving and Christmas
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   Day.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.560]   It is unfortunately very, very abridged.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.200]   It's only an hour and 47 minutes.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.520]   But I would even go so far as to say that of all the versions of A Christmas Carol that
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:45.760]   have ever been produced for TV or the movies, I think it's the one that's closest to the
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.760]   original source that really feels as though all the character, all the spirit and the
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.440]   basic good nature of the story are reflected.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.480]   If there's only one thing that I could call out, it's that I think Patrick Stewart understands
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.760]   that the key to A Christmas Carol is understanding that Scrooge isn't the villain of the piece.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.760]   He's the hero of the piece.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.880]   And that's how he portrays it from start to finish.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   Wonderful.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   Absolutely love this.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.200]   If I could give this to every single person, I know I would do that because it's just
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   a brilliant.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:20.360]   It's if I don't know if I can ever say that anything is my single most favorite audiobook,
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.640]   but this is the one that I would be one of the two or three that would come into that
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.560]   list before I start arguing that we'll know who can pick just one.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.560]   Wow.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.560]   Now I've got to have to get this.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.920]   That's great.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.560]   So this could be your holiday gift from Andy and not go.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.880]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.640]   Bring those bells.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.840]   Sign up for the gold account.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840]   You'll love it.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.160]   I am an audible fanatic as is Andy, as is Alex, as is everybody I know because we just
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.720]   love listening to great books.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.160]   And it's a way of reading when you really just couldn't read.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:56.240]   I am now in the middle of the second book of the Game of Thrones, the Song of Ice and
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.240]   Fire.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.040]   It's called A Clash of Kings.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.040]   Is that what it is?
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.040]   I think it is.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.120]   And it is just, Roy Dottrice is so good.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.760]   And I just love, I just love listening.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.360]   Got a plane, got an overnight red eye tonight and I will be listening to audible.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]   Always am.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.400]   Audible.com/
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400]   We fight mono tasker.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.960]   That's all I got to say.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.160]   That's my audible lady.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.160]   That's good.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.000]   We fight mono tasking.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   We fight mono tasking.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.920]   That's how I read all my books.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.920]   Is it on cleaning or?
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.960]   Well, and you know, they're now passing laws against using the phone in the car, but there's
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.400]   not a law against listening to audiobooks in the car.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   And it actually helps you.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:35.640]   It helps keep you from picking up that phone and texting because you're engaged in the
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:36.640]   book.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.000]   So it probably helps safety.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.280]   We thank them for their support.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.120]   Now let's get an iOS tip of the week.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.880]   So this is actually an AT&T tip of the week.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880]   Oh.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   But it's connected to your iOS.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.880]   Don't use sprint.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.880]   Don't use sprint.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   There's my tip of the week.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.880]   Done.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:54.880]   That's it.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.880]   No, no, no.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.280]   So one of the things is people, I travel overseas a lot and oftentimes I turn on and off
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.280]   my international plan.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.280]   I do that all.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   Yes.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.280]   Yes.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.120]   But sometimes you leave and you forgot to call them.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.760]   And the tip of the week is to remember that AT&T is actually very flexible in this area.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.360]   Because I haven't called yet to turn it off.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.360]   Well, no, no.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.560]   So as far as turning it off, but when you want to turn it on, so I forgot I went to
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   France.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.560]   Oh, you could turn it on that day.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.560]   Couple days into the trip.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.560]   Right.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.560]   You can call.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.560]   In fact, you'll get this warning that says, hey, you're going to have a really expensive
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.560]   thing.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.960]   If you call AT&T, they will backlog it.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.760]   So it's not just when you started.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.120]   So you get to France and you've been there for two or three days and suddenly realize
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.040]   you're not on the international plan.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.880]   You can actually call AT&T and request it.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:38.880]   And they'll usually suggest it.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.720]   They'll say, hey, when did you actually get to Paris?
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.720]   Let's start this.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:44.720]   So don't give up on it.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.000]   If you're going overseas, don't give up and say, oh, well, there's nothing I can do.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000]   You can actually--
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.280]   It can be so expensive.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   If you're not--
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.080]   If you're doing data roaming, it could be tens of thousands of dollars if you're not
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.080]   very careful.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.240]   I was careful and it cost me $800 one time.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.240]   Now, I get my international plan.
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.240]   And there's actually the other--
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.040]   It's like a buck a megabyte.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.040]   Something like that.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.040]   And it's--
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:07.880]   So it's still a lot cheap, but it's worth-- the other tip is that there is another-- there's
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.120]   a bigger data plan that is not promoted.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.120]   Oh.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.120]   So there's a big one.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.800]   It's like $400 for the month or whatever.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   But if you really are going to spend--
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   It's just 500 megabytes.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.120]   But it saves you an enormous amount.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.400]   And I use that-- I've used it a couple of times.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   Absolutely.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   It's still a lot less than it would have been otherwise.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.600]   It's nice if you're wandering through Shibuya and you don't know where the hell you are,
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   the ability to pull up a map and have that 3G data on your phone.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.960]   It's a lifesaver when you trip.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.640]   Well, and the tip to that is that especially if you're in Japan, this company that we
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.640]   use--
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.640]   They're in Japanese.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.160]   Well, no, but they-- this modem, $175 per week, they deliver it to either the airport
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   or to your hotel.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   How much a week?
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   $175.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   Okay.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   If you're there for a week and you want-- it's unlimited data.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160]   That's nice.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.960]   It's fast and it-- the battery life is very long.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.960]   It's surprising.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   It's nice.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.800]   And it is-- and you just carry it around and then suddenly you have Wi-Fi.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.120]   So in Japan, that's definitely-- that was a killer solution.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:08.000]   And Leona, who are producer-- she get cars for everybody?
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.280]   No, just a couple of them.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   And we kind of shared them.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   That wasn't going to work for them.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.280]   That's legal.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.600]   Yeah, so no, no, it'll up to five people.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.640]   It's a typical Wi-Fi.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.720]   For some reason, it is-- it's bigger and 10 times more stable than the Verizon Wi-Fi
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   that I have.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720]   That's really a good tip, actually.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.240]   We had it sitting in our pocket the whole time and we just wandered all over the place.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.520]   And with iMessage, it makes a big difference because you're not paying for every single
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.520]   message.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.880]   And there are just messaging back and forth.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.160]   And you could always tell when someone-- like, I could always tell when someone was leaving,
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.960]   going too far away because suddenly they're-- I couldn't see my bars anymore.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960]   Come back.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   My daughter would have the--
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960]   At the access point.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.960]   My daughter had the access point.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.400]   She'd just wander almost like, "I've lost my daughter."
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.800]   She's the first rule of pixel core.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.560]   Do not wander off with the access point.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.560]   Exactly.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560]   So those are-- and that's something to also do research in.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.760]   I don't know what they do in other countries, but I know in Japan it's a great service.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.760]   It shows up at your hotel.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.760]   You leave it at your hotel.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:04.760]   You don't have to think about it at all.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.760]   That's really great.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.760]   And it's killer.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.000]   Who do you call for that?
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   I post it somewhere.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]   I don't know how much it is.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]   Leona got it.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.440]   Yeah, I feel like she knows.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.040]   And now it's Andy's Lion Raw tip of the week.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.720]   This is-- I've ducked out so you can see this a little bit better.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.880]   This is a new feature in the preview app in Lion.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.000]   Preview is one of the most handy apps that you get for free with this sort of thing.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.160]   They've actually added a magnification feature.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.040]   So right now I've got-- there's a couple screenshots.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.960]   I've got a manual for a new camera here.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:45.200]   And they've decided to cleverly put the diagram for how to hit a certain function key in a
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.560]   tiny, tiny little thing.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.480]   Normally it'd have to open up the window or start zooming in, zooming in, zooming in.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.960]   Instead, all I have to do is hit the tilde key, the tilde accent key underneath the escape
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.040]   key.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.960]   And this little magnifier will pop up.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:58.960]   Oh, isn't that neat?
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.880]   It'll just magnify whatever you're looking at by a factor or two.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.360]   So if you're dealing with scan documents-- oh, there it goes.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.360]   There's a live fire exercise.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.360]   Isn't that nice?
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   Wow.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.040]   So if you're dealing with scan documents or travel documents like that, it just saves
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.080]   you so much effort.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.920]   Because then you have to reset the window.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.560]   If you use the zoom feature, you have to-- if you use the standard zoom in feature, then
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560]   you have to reset it to where it was before you got it.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.560]   You know, it's cool.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.560]   It understands the width of text.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:29.280]   So here, where the text is a narrow width, it's a narrow magnifier.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:33.240]   When I go to a line that goes across the page, it goes wide.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.840]   That's really smart.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.840]   That's really neat.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   I think of everything.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.000]   Boy, these Apple people, they ought to do some UI stuff.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.880]   I think it's funny when you see some of these improvements and you realize that the people
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.920]   who write the software also tend to use the software because this wasn't like a boardroom
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.240]   like whiteboard sort of thing.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.800]   That was like some guy who has some sort of involvement in previous saying, "Dang it,
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.520]   I'm so sick and tired of zooming in.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.520]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.520]   I have the source code to this.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.360]   I could add this feature if I wanted to."
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.520]   And so long as I don't tell my boss about it until it actually ships, everybody else
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.120]   will be able to use this feature too.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   Very nice.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.120]   Check it.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   I didn't even know.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.120]   You know, it's great.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.280]   I love these tips because I had no idea that was there and there it is right there
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   in the menus.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.320]   All right.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.600]   And now it would be a good time to do our picks of the week.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.600]   May I start?
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   Sure.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.000]   I don't think I've mentioned this.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.800]   We've mentioned an iPad today, but it's an iPhone app that just took the world by storm.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.920]   When we were in Paris, it came out.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.280]   Now you may remember Dave Moran, who used to work at Facebook, left Facebook to start
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.040]   a company last year called Path, very famously was offered $100 million by Google to buy
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.040]   it.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.840]   They had a kind of junky, not junky, but an underwhelming iPhone app.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.440]   The only feature, it was a photo sharing app, the only feature of which that was at all
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.320]   unique was that you could only share it with 50 people.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.840]   And I thought, well, that's dumb.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.600]   Why would I want to do that?
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.200]   He turned down $100 million from Google.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.400]   So obviously this guy had something up his sleeve.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.400]   And in fact, he did because a couple of weeks ago, Path 2.0 came out and it's actually a
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.160]   mobile form of Facebook that I love.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.680]   Most of all, the limits now raise to 150 people, but that turns out to be a good thing because
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:23.960]   you then very careful about who you pick on your friends list.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.720]   You make it your actual friends.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:28.160]   You know, I only have 50 people in here right now.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.920]   You can share, and this is by the way, one of the most, just get it to look at the interface.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.400]   One of the most beautiful interfaces ever.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.840]   You could share photos.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.760]   You could share people that you're with.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.960]   You have, look how that spins when it goes back in.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.160]   Places you are, songs you're singing, it's Search the iTunes database to do that.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.840]   Just do a little tweet or let's do it, let's do a text message so I can say hello.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.960]   Now normally it's shared only with the people, the 53 friends that I've made.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.440]   I can also add to that a location.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.200]   Look how gorgeous this UI is.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.440]   I can also add to it people that I'm with.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.600]   So I'm here with IAS and Tom and I think Eileen is here.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.600]   Let's add.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600]   I skipped.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.600]   Did I skip you?
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600]   There she is.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.600]   So I'm going to add those people.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.760]   I'm going to say done.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.160]   And now here's a nice feature.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.200]   And this is what really made it a killer app for me.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.960]   So by the way, that's great.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.880]   Now I've got 50 people I care about.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:26.520]   This would be great for you to get with your family members when you travel.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:29.920]   It's a really nice way to share pictures.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.800]   And by the way, video as well, I'll show you that feature in a second.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.640]   But it's, you know, it's a closed network for people like me.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:41.320]   And I say, well, you know, I would also like to share those images with the outside world.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:47.080]   You can turn on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or four square.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.920]   So you get to choose who, what public networks you want to share this on.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.560]   So this has become actually my full time interface to those four networks.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.200]   Be great if they added Instagram.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.800]   I'll cancel that one and I'll show you one other nice feature.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.200]   You can add videos.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.320]   A lot of pictures.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.840]   These are people who I follow.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:04.840]   They're my friends.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.200]   You can comment on anything that you see.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.000]   You even have these little smiley faces.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:17.200]   You could put a happy face, a wink, a gasp, a frown, or I love that picture on there.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:22.520]   There's, there's, I asked this post of, I, the mayor of Twitmaster control.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.520]   That would be me.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.920]   I would be you, I guess.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.280]   Are you the mayor of Twit now?
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.360]   No, no, just of master control.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.640]   Ah, just of this area.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   There's somebody's Ferrari.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.520]   I didn't even know I knew somebody with a Ferrari.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.120]   But let me go back a little bit.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.560]   This is a video that I posted earlier of us bringing our cat.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.160]   The cat is actually in the bag.
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.640]   We're bringing it to the back.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.480]   I'm talking about having a cat in the bag.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.280]   It's a cat in the bag going to the vet.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.520]   You should have used a hat.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.320]   So that's within the UI.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.480]   Now you can also of course go full screen if you want and look at it.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.960]   And one of the things I like about path is they upload full quality of video and pictures.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.480]   So when you do go full screen, they look good.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:11.040]   And you can also save the video out yours and others to your photo album.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.480]   So it's just, I just, it's a very thoughtfully designed.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.720]   You like that, the cat in the bag?
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.720]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.480]   I was thinking how much funny it would have been if you were also holding a shovel.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.280]   No, the cat's alive.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.280]   No, I know.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.280]   It's Charlie.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.640]   You just, you just don't get clawed to death while you take them to the vet.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.640]   I understand.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.560]   No, people are saying, well, what?
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560]   That's cool.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.560]   No, Charlie is so big.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.560]   He's huge.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.440]   He's not fit in a pet carrier.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.920]   We can't, there is no cat box that he fits.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920]   He doesn't mind it.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.680]   He's happy in the bag.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.600]   He's being held and he's not living around.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   You can see him.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   He's just kind of like, oh, he's happy in the bag.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.240]   Of course we fed him some whiskey first.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.520]   No, no, he was happy in the bag.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.560]   So I just, I just love path.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:54.440]   Now don't ask to follow me on path because I only follow my close friends because that's
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.440]   really the idea.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.640]   You only get 150 people.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.240]   This is not a public sharing network.
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.000]   For that use Facebook, you can subscribe to me on Facebook and most of the stuff that
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.120]   I want to be seen publicly.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:08.080]   I just share via path over to my Facebook.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.440]   So don't feel hurt if I don't add you.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.440]   And frankly, the path really in its design encourages you to ignore people.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.520]   And I just, I'm not doing it Renee.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.600]   I don't even know who you are.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.240]   So I'm only, I'm sure it's nothing against you.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.320]   I'm just sharing with people.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:28.040]   I like, by the way, you might notice a real similarity in path to Facebook's timelines.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:31.600]   It has a big picture on the front, a little picture of you.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.240]   It's very timeline-y, isn't it?
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.960]   Dave Moran used to work at Facebook.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.520]   By the way, there's Henry passing his driver's exam.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.640]   So he's going to get his learner's permit.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.640]   Oh boy.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.800]   Oh boy.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.640]   So these are the kinds of pictures you share with family that you might not share, you
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.200]   know, there he is before the test.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   Look at a little of his.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.240]   You might not share in public.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:55.040]   And so I just, I just love this and I want everybody to take a look at it.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.240]   I've only, because this is, I think, the nicest, this and the new flip board, which I'm sure
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:03.040]   you guys talked about, which also came out at the same time.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:09.000]   This new iPhone flip board is fantastic, are the best examples of iPhone UI design.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.080]   I'm really, we're really starting to see some gorgeous design and iPhone UI.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.600]   And I think, Path, download it just for that.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.040]   You know, free and a really nice piece of software.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.680]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.880]   How about you, Alex?
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   What's that?
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.880]   Battery.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.880]   It is a battery.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.280]   So, again, I travel a lot and you end up with a situation where you don't have enough
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.480]   battery on your iPhone or one of your devices.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:35.480]   All the time.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.480]   All the time.
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:37.480]   You know, I have a Mophie case.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:42.080]   And what happens though, when the Mophie case has been depleted and the iPhone is depleted?
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.080]   I have another Mophie case.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.080]   I have another Mophie case too.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.280]   I've rotated, I've rotated Mophie cases.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.440]   But what happens, what happens, the problem is that you're always charging all these things.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.440]   That's right.
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.920]   Occasionally, you're in an emergency, you don't have any more battery power.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.360]   You just need your iPad or your iPhone or any other USB device.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:06.080]   And what you need is you just need to go to a hardware store or a 7-Eleven and get some,
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.440]   what you really wish you could do is just go buy some batteries and charge your phone.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.000]   That's what this does.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   So, look.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.480]   So, you show me, I don't understand.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:16.040]   Oh, it's just a bunch of batteries.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040]   Okay, here we'll do the close up.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]   It's a box with batteries.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.880]   You can't do the close up because you don't have a camera.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:20.880]   So, I'll show you.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.680]   This is a box with batteries that go in a box, but then the box has what?
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   A USB?
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:27.680]   Oh, it does.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.680]   It does have a USB there.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:29.680]   And it lights up.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.280]   How much charging are you going to get out of that?
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.000]   One of those four batteries equal basically the life of one iPhone battery.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.120]   So you could charge this all the way, charge your iPhone all the way in.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.440]   And it works with any USB thing.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.240]   So, this Mifi that we were using in Japan.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.320]   So, we wanted to make sure that we could use it all the time.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.320]   I like that.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320]   This was the backup.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.480]   The, you know, the rip cord, if I think went down, we could plug this in.
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.480]   That's neat.
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480]   And then you just...
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.480]   Yep.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.120]   Any device that takes a USB cable, is it enough?
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.720]   It's probably not enough wattage for an iPad.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720]   It's 800 milliamps, which should be enough.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.360]   Doesn't it need 10 watts?
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.360]   10 watts?
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.360]   I don't think so.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.360]   Yeah, I think it does.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.720]   Well, let's try charging an iPad with this.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720]   That'd be my test.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   Yes.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720]   That's cool.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720]   And it's got an off battery.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.720]   It's called the mobile battery.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.720]   I bet it's cheap.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720]   It's from Pelican.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.720]   It's in Japan, it's cheap.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.720]   In Japan, it's cheap.
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720]   In Japan, it's 20 bucks.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.200]   And in the United States, the cheapest I found online, which, by the way, is a really cool
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.200]   website.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.040]   There's a website called AudioCubes, Japan's Best Kept Secrets.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.040]   AudioCubes.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.040]   So, I found this in Japan.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.080]   I found this in big camera.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.080]   And if anyone's been to big camera, it's awesome.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:36.080]   Anyway, so I found this in big camera.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.840]   They have like, there's, of course, 80 versions of this in Japan.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   And but this is...
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.240]   I found this one in AudioCubes is the website that I found.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.240]   And it's about $50.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.080]   But what I will say is that this is never...
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.000]   I'm never going to travel without it because I just want to know that no matter what, I
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.240]   can plug a USB device in and charge it if I need to.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.000]   You know, and I can always buy more batteries.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]   I can always buy more batteries.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.560]   I don't want to worry about whether I charge it.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.720]   No, generally, I'm not going to use it.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.200]   I'm going to leave nice, fresh batteries.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:08.040]   And if everything goes well, I'll never use it.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:14.120]   But I have had situations where I need to do a business call and now I'm hosed because
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.120]   I can't.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.120]   Right.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.400]   I love this idea.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:18.400]   So it's...
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.400]   I wish it were cheaper here.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.400]   That's ridiculous.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.400]   I do wish it was cheaper.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.800]   I hope someone walks this, walks the show and buys something.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:25.880]   I mean, 20 bucks is about right.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   $50.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.880]   Also, it's been imported from Japan.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:29.880]   That's why.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:30.880]   And they come in different colors.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.880]   Go ahead.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.200]   There's nothing stopping from buying $2,700 million power rechargeable batteries and using
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.520]   that as your power source.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.520]   True.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.520]   Right.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.120]   So then I bet you can get more than one recharge out of it.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120]   Good point.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.120]   Yes.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:43.280]   Good point.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   So anyway, that's my...
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.920]   The Amazon has something similar for $4.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:48.920]   Let's see.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920]   Let me...
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.920]   Let's look.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.920]   Let's look.
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.920]   Chatroom is so good at that.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.920]   That is excellent if it's true.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920]   Looks pretty similar.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.920]   Can you put AA batteries in there?
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.920]   AA battery.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:58.920]   I want an hour charger.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:50:59.920]   Probably two.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.920]   Two might not be enough.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.920]   A while back there was a...
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:03.920]   Oh, the one pixel more.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.560]   The week was...
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.840]   The really great Aida Fruits site had is really cool kit for converting an Altoids 10 into
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:11.840]   a USB rechargeer.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:12.840]   Right.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:17.940]   They had like a Radio Shack battery clip, had the electronics components just sold or sold
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:18.940]   or sold together.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:22.280]   As I remember there's a little bit of an issue getting through TSA with that.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.280]   Homemade...
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.280]   Homemade.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   What is this homemade thing?
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:27.840]   I have enough trouble getting through TSA as it is.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.520]   So I'm seeing a variety of...
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.960]   The one we just showed was two.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.280]   Newer has one that says 3X.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:35.920]   I presume that's three portable.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:36.920]   Three...
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.560]   Yeah, there's two and three batteries.
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.560]   That's interesting.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.280]   Of course, you've had a lover of things.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.280]   What's this?
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.120]   This looks like it has five.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.880]   No, it's just five X.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.880]   And the thing is I don't want to have something that I have to charge.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.880]   So that's the big two AA.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.880]   It says this is two.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.880]   Yeah, two AA.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.880]   Two AA's.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.000]   I don't know what the five X means.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.080]   But what I would suggest is whether you buy this one or one of those, it's just great
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:03.440]   to have something that you can charge your iPhone with AA as a backup.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.320]   I don't suggest doing it all the time.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.760]   But having something in your bag that you can just simply...
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.240]   I can stop anywhere and charge it.
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.240]   That's what I needed.
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:15.800]   And of course, you have, there's a number of them that you recharge the recharger.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.680]   But I like this because you can buy batteries for them.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   That's the key.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680]   That's the key to the operation.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.680]   Andy, you're not going to...
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.640]   Go, you're pick of the week.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:28.440]   My pick of the week is this really great online newsletter I discovered.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.040]   It's called TID BITS.
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.040]   Yay!
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.720]   Now, T-I-D, capital B, capital I, capital T, capital S.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:40.160]   I don't know if you have to capitalize it in your web browser.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.560]   But I'm saying it exactly how they gave the Uniform Resource Locator.
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.760]   That's what it's called to me.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:50.400]   Yes, I'm talking like it's 1993 and TID BITS is still brand new.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.080]   Even though I think they're even older than that.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.720]   Yes, we all know TID BITS.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.760]   One of the just...
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.920]   It's like the New York Times of Mac News, Mac Tips.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.920]   Excuse me, Apple News, Apple Tips, Apple Everything.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:09.400]   Run by the angst, Adam and Tonya, and a staff of really sharp, sharp individuals.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.960]   One of the go-to resources when you need to learn anything about anything.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:19.000]   It's always been run sort of on a PBS model where if you go to the website, there are banner
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.640]   ads, but it's mostly sponsored by corporate sponsorship.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:26.920]   A couple of weeks ago, they announced that, well, it's modern times and corporate sponsors,
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:29.320]   money is not quite as big as it used to be.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:33.560]   Rather than collapse TID BITS into something cheap that we can run under the money we now
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:37.640]   have available, we would like to continue to run at the exact same high level we've already
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:42.600]   had, meaning that we can actually hire and pay writers to do really great content.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.640]   We have the ability to create new features for our content management system to continue
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.640]   to deliver great features to our readers.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:55.520]   So they decided to add, to sort of change their model a little bit and have a subscription
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:03.160]   alternative where if you don't contribute to, if you don't buy a subscription to TID BITS,
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.480]   you still get access to the content.
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:10.880]   If you subscribe to TID BITS and they have annual fees anywhere, five or six different
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.680]   levels, starting at 20 bucks a year, 20 stinking, miserable, tiny little bucks a year, all
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:21.200]   the way up to a thousand bucks a year, a thousand bucks for a lifetime subscription.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.600]   And if you subscribe, you get, they'll, I'll have a listen in front of me, they will,
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.920]   you get the version of the TID BITS website, fruit graphical ads, the RSS feed, we'll
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.360]   get the full text of all articles via RSS feed.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:35.040]   Don't subscribe, you just get the headers, you have to click on these links in Google
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.240]   Reader to get at them.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.160]   You can get articles emailed to you immediately.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.800]   It's, you get some discounts on software, you get discount on all the, all the answers
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.680]   take control ebooks.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.520]   It's a good value when you're supporting something really, really great.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.280]   Also if you, if you do go for the thousand bucks, lifetime, lifetime membership, you get
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.800]   to have dinner with the TID BITS staff.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.120]   And also an open invitation that if you're in the ethical area, by all means, oh, you
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:04.280]   gotta go to it.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.280]   There's the negative.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.000]   They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll fix your dinner for a thousand bucks.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]   They'll fix your dinner.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.440]   You know, I should do that because we just use so much of their material all the time.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.440]   I should just, I'll, I'll just send them a check.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.800]   And they, I should re-enterase not as though they're like, they're a sinking ship and
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.800]   they're going down.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:20.800]   Oh, no, no.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.240]   They need, they need, they're all there, all they're, all they're saying is that this
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.040]   corporate sponsorship they used to rely on is not quite so big.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.080]   That's TID BITS, even if you don't pay for it, it's still going on.
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.160]   It's just that they're giving an opportunity for that huge community of TID BITS readers
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.880]   to show their support and show how much they appreciate all the work that the TID BITS staff
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:44.040]   is doing by giving them 20 miserable, tiny, stinking bucks a year.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.040]   Do it.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.040]   Do it.
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.040]   Do it.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.280]   On these side, but it's not that frickin bad.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.800]   No, it's very similar to what we do.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.480]   I mean, I think if you have a community around you that appreciates what you're doing, it's
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.200]   great to take advantage of that.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.160]   And you know, in some ways it's a nice thing to offer the community because then they get
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.080]   to buy in and participate.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:08.000]   If our bricks are almost all done, we're almost done with 1,800 bricks we sold at a high price
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.960]   to, they were not inexpensive.
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.680]   And we're going to do, I do promise a gig of pan.
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.240]   Maybe you can help me out.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:15.240]   Gig of pan of all bricks.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.240]   I have a gig of pan.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:19.360]   Yeah, because I want people to be able to go to the website and find their brick.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.360]   Right.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:24.200]   And just a button, something you were talking about at the top of the show about a community
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.960]   sponsored building community and them supporting your work.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.440]   It really is gratifying when you have a situation like this where I think so many of Tibet's
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.200]   readers have been, if they had been presented with an opportunity to just toss a few bucks
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.240]   their way, would have been happy to do that because they feel as though they are being
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:45.920]   a plus contributor as opposed to just a negative contributor to the enterprise.
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:46.920]   Exactly.
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:53.240]   And so it's, I do agree that I think the utopia and hopefully a realizable utopia for the
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:57.240]   future of content creation is exactly the sort of thing where you give away your content
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.640]   relentlessly and religiously and reliably for a number of years.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.400]   And then you get people that are not only so appreciative for the work that you do and
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.520]   looking forward to your next thing that you do, but also they're very, very eager and
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:14.160]   willing to actually contribute to the creation and your support.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.400]   So it's a great thing.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.560]   Twenty stinking bucks.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.080]   Well worth it or fifty or seventy five bucks.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.080]   You got it.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:25.840]   Adam and Tanya's chimes right now, tidbits.com jingle, jingle, jingle.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.400]   And I think the Vera Ellen on the wall says it's time to wrap this up.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.400]   Rosemary Clooney.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:32.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:34.400]   It's zoomed in.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.400]   It's three.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.400]   I've done that every time to pour Rosemary Clooney.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:39.160]   I just can't believe that she ever looked like that.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.800]   Oh, I understand the hair is mesmerizing.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.800]   It is.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.680]   There's something I want to stick my finger in that swirl.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:51.160]   It's like the T 5000 robot.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.160]   My kid said that to me.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.600]   He said, you look like an old Jimmy Neutron.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:58.120]   That's a reference probably none will get.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.680]   Thank you, Andy and I go Chicago Sun times.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:07.120]   You should also visit his website www.cwob.com.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:14.400]   He's also at an echo on the Twitter, I H N A T K O.
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.400]   Have a wonderful holiday.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.320]   I hope you're doing something fun for the holidays.
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.840]   Once again, actually going back to Patrick Stewart's Christmas Carol, I spend the entire
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:29.280]   Christmas day driving all up and down, knowing when visiting friends and family and playing
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:35.360]   usually playing a mixture of Patrick Stewart's Christmas Carol and one of my best friends,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:40.680]   really awesome holiday CD tape that he's been doing ever since that we were in high school.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.680]   So fun to do.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:44.200]   Well, I have a great Christmas.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.200]   Merry Christmas to you.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.200]   Happy Hanukkah to everybody.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:50.040]   Whatever, however you choose to express peace, love and joy this week.
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:53.800]   I hope you get to express it and experience it this week and next year.
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.800]   Absolutely.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.600]   And take care.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.440]   We'll see you in the new year.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:03.120]   We have next week we're going to do a best of show, which Andy will be featured prominently
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:07.360]   and of course, but we'll be back in a car to in a car.
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.560]   Yeah, Andy knows that.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:12.760]   Yeah, the trunk of a car desperately bleeding.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:13.760]   Let me out.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.760]   Let me out.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:15.760]   We're at a stoplight.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:21.760]   I hear a circus to my left, but we will be back on December, sorry, January 3rd, I guess
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:27.240]   it is for 2012 and a brand new year of Mac Break with me.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.240]   Thank you, Andrew.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.960]   Thank you to Alex Lindsey, pixel core.com for the multimedia guild of artists learning
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.400]   and working together, pixel core.tv for their podcast.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.480]   Are you going to do a live thing on Thursday?
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.640]   Thursday, we're not doing a live thing for pixel core, but I am doing a class at filmmakers,
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.200]   you know, seminars, webinars.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:47.000]   So the filmmaker seminars, this is the live streaming.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000]   So I'm doing it.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000]   It's a class.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000]   Should we go to filmmakerseminars.com?
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000]   Yeah, I think it's filmmakerseminar.com.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000]   Okay.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.080]   And I think it's right on the front page, but it's free.
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:00.360]   So if you want to, and I think there's like 1600 people registered or something, so it's
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:04.120]   going to be, and so it's been about 90 minutes talking about live streaming and some of the
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:10.040]   stuff that we've learned so far related to using everything from how to get it set up
