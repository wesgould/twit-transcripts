[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.720]   Apple rumors for WWDC, including a new Mac book Pro.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.160]   And those iPhone 7 rumors are they to be credited?
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.720]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.640]   where we cover the latest news from Appleland.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.880]   And there is lots of news, believe it or not, from Appleland.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.760]   We'll start with the man with the beer,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   Jim Dowl Rimples back.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   Great to have you back, Jim, from lupensight.com.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.480]   Great to be here.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.640]   I love having you on it.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.120]   He went inside today.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.200]   I did.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.160]   No more airplane strafing.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.240]   I just want you to know that has nothing to do
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.560]   with why we haven't had you on.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.120]   I've just we've been jammed because what we try to do--
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.360]   we can't-- I don't really want to do more than four panelists.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.600]   And so Alex Lindsey keeps showing up, damn him.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000]   So we love Alex.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.480]   So but we're glad to have you.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.920]   Alex took the day off and we're glad to have Jim Dowl Rimples
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.240]   with us.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.080]   And there's something to talk about, too,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   because WWDC is just around the corner.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   And you and Renee Richie might have something to say about it.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.960]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.520]   I'm more doubtful.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   I'm just happy that Jim is actually in a house
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   because he keeps saying he lives under a bridge.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.080]   And this makes me so much happier for his future.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   He only looks like he lives under a bridge.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   I stayed at a friend's house.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.560]   I'm doing a podcast.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   Can I borrow your bridge?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.920]   Also with us Andy and I co Chicago Sun Times and CWOP.com.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   Hello.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.320]   A big rumor.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.440]   And I don't know whether to credit it or not.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   It comes from Ming Chi Quo of the analyst
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.120]   who seems to have a fairly good track record
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.920]   that there will be new MacBook Pros with fingerprint readers
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.160]   and OLED keys.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.400]   Credible.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Can we get a yep or a nope for Mr. D?
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.920]   Look, I think the best way to look at WWDC
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.960]   is that it is first and foremost a developer conference.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   So they're going to have all kinds of APIs
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.360]   and all kinds of software news.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.640]   But it's also been the place where they do release new Macs.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.840]   So I mean, I don't think we'll see new iPads or new iPhones.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   But Macs have been released there pretty steadily
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.040]   in the past years.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.640]   So I wouldn't doubt that there's some kind of Mac on the horizon.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   It would make sense too because it's a developer conference.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.720]   That's what developers use.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.440]   They're not using iPads to write software.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.480]   So that would make sense.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.720]   They've done it before to Jim's point.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.480]   I mean, for years, every morning at WWDC,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.040]   everyone lined up outside the Apple Store
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.280]   waiting to get whatever shipments of the brand new MacBook
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   they got in.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   So this historical president-- and Ming Chi Quo
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.000]   does have good supply chain sources.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.720]   And they're always exactly temporally aligned
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.000]   because things do get moved forward and backwards.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.160]   But I don't want to say overdue because Intel
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.280]   has to make the chips before Apple can use them.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.120]   But Skylake has been around for a while,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   and it'd be great to see those in the next round.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.320]   That'll be one of the last OEMs to make a Skylake laptop.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   I mean, everybody else, including Microsoft,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   I've got the HP MacBook clone here.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.680]   They're all using Skylake.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.720]   So it's time Apple, I guess.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   It used to be Apple be the first to get the new Intel chips.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.640]   And I think this was a wise thing to wait on.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   Skylake was very challenging for Microsoft, for instance.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   They were super patient with this.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.320]   And other features, like the rumors are one thing.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.720]   Apple's been working on Touch ID Macs
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.160]   and a whole bunch of stuff for a long time.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   But it's always the question of how.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.360]   Like when you look at how it's done on iOS,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   there's a very clear chain from Apple's custom chipset
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.720]   to the sensor and hardware lockdown.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.200]   It's incredibly secure.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   But now they're using an Intel chipset.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.880]   And is there an Intel version of a secure enclave?
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   And how are they protecting that?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.040]   Because computers are traditionally more accessible
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.080]   than iOS devices.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.840]   So for me, it's not so much what are they gonna do,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.400]   but how are they gonna implement it?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.800]   And then I'll listen to security now
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   when you and Steve go through it.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.880]   And that's gonna be the fascinating part.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.040]   - Well, that's exactly right.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.540]   I mean, it's easy to say, oh, let's have a fingerprint chip.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   But how are you gonna protect all of that information
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.520]   because in iOS it all is protected?
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.480]   So, you know, there's more to it
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   than just adding a feature of you can log in
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.560]   with your fingerprint.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.520]   - We should point out that the chance miller
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.480]   writing a 9-5 Mac confirms this.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   He says our own source is confirm it,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.080]   but he's saying fourth quarter.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.920]   So they may announce it next month,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.480]   but you're gonna be waiting for a while.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   - Wow.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's always an interesting idea
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.560]   when you're thinking about what hardware could be,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.640]   at least shown off at WWDC,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.160]   because it could be that there is an empty session
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.600]   in the schedule right now that reflects.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.880]   Here's how to support the new swipe,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.480]   LED display that we're gonna be putting into every MacBook
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.800]   from now on, or here's how you can integrate
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.520]   with this new touch ID sensor fob
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.320]   that we're putting on to make it independent
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.080]   with other devices.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.760]   - And also just to the other points that were being made,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   it's not the, it's a lot easier for a lot of PC makers
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.640]   to just swap in a new CPU,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.720]   because they really are built that way,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   but it's not necessarily as easy as replacing a light bulb
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.200]   with an LED bulb.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.720]   Oftentimes there are just a whole bunch of knock on effects
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.040]   that you can't anticipate.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680]   Plus, Apple tends to take a system wide approach
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   rather than being the first to put a sky like processor in.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.960]   They tend to, their personality tends to be,
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.160]   how can we optimize things to take advantage
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.200]   of this new processor?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.440]   They'll get an automatic bump just by putting the CPU in,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.680]   but there are ways that they could make
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.000]   their existing subsystems work even better
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.640]   above what simple hot swap specs would give them.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   - Let me give you the rundown from the 9 to 5 Mac article.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.120]   There'll be 13 and 15 inch models.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.480]   They will be thinner and lighter,
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.320]   okay, with design, and I like this,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.400]   I'm thrilled to hear this,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.760]   design cues from the 12 inch MacBook Touch ID support,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   and an OLED display touch bar above the keyboard
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.880]   that will replace the physical function keys,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   injection metal, injection molded hinges,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   and I'd be very happy to hear this too,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.880]   USB-C support, I'm hoping that's the power adapter as well.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.240]   Actually, if you put USB-C in,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.280]   you might as well make it the power adapter,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.960]   and Thunderbolt 3, which was of course missing
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.880]   on the updated MacBook.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.680]   They say they will also, now this one is a stretch
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.720]   'cause they just released a new MacBook.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   They'll introduce a new 13 inch MacBook
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   similar to the 12 inch Retina model,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.520]   and the MacBook, this is according to Quo,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.360]   Apple will make the MacBook Air entry level,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.800]   the MacBook mid-tier and MacBook Pro high-end.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   - A lot of air makes sense.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   - Yeah, I mean, they just position it,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.280]   well, a couple of things, like to me at this point,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.480]   it is a holistic approach.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.040]   They do, like sometimes they do get the chips early
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.600]   because in order to make that MacBook Air,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.120]   they need that chip from Intel to do it,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.800]   so they have to get that chip right away.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.040]   In this case, they might be waiting
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   on that touch ID sensor to properly work,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.560]   in which case they're gonna bump to Skylake,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.680]   but it makes no sense to put out a Skylake computer,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.800]   and then three months later bump it with a touch ID sensor.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.120]   So they have to sort of manage
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.880]   when those technologies are ready,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   and right now the MacBook,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.600]   just by virtue of how expensive it is
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   and how new it is,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.920]   is not the top of the line in terms of performance,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.560]   but in terms of being the newest Mac, it absolutely is.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.720]   When the MacBook Pro comes out with this new redesign,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.520]   suddenly it's the newest hottest thing,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.440]   and the MacBook naturally falls to middle,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.280]   and because MacBook Air hasn't been discontinued,
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.160]   but you know, while at $900,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   that it just naturally falls into the lower price.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.120]   So there is a lot of thought that goes into it,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.320]   but all of this also makes sense
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.560]   when you look at how those products are released.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.600]   - I just, it makes a lot,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.480]   I think it makes sense for them to go,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   if we're gonna go with the traditional
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.720]   good better best product lines,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.480]   to make the MacBook Air the good one,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.320]   or at least the most expensive relatively,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.440]   most affordable relatively speaking,
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.120]   make the MacBook the desirable one, the one that,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.320]   well, how many won't we spend $200 more,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.480]   get this really nice one that's slimmer,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.960]   it has all these other nice features,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.840]   and the MacBook Pro,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.400]   I can't say anything as to these rumors
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.440]   about the design of the next MacBook Pro,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.600]   but this does not look like a Pro device,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.920]   it looks like a really good MacBook.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.840]   So I'd be, especially if they follow through,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.600]   there's also some parts of the rumor that says
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.640]   that the keyboard is gonna be along the lines
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.760]   of the magic keyboard,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.360]   or along the lines of the sort of keyboard
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.720]   that you get with a plain MacBook,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.560]   which would kind of stink in a pro level machine.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.600]   This is the thing, we're only responding to rumors,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   but this does not describe to me a $2300 computer,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.880]   but it's something that's been on my mind
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.200]   since Google I/O last week,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.040]   is that I wouldn't be terribly surprised now
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.480]   if for the past several months,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.000]   Apple has decided that we are absolutely not
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.280]   in a position to compete in any way
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.640]   with all the sectors of the laptop market
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.400]   that are reading our lunch.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Right now, it's a desperate situation
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.800]   in education for Apple right now,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.840]   because nobody wanted to be--
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.720]   - Google made a big point about the Chromebook
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680]   outselling the Macbook,
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.760]   the Macintosh, all Mac's last quarter.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.920]   - And it doesn't help that this is now,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.160]   it used to be, it was bad enough
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.360]   when this was a $300 laptop that was well made
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.840]   that runs a really nice free suite of software
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.520]   that education and a lot of even companies really like,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.200]   it's gonna get even worse at the end of the year
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.600]   when Android and apps can run natively,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.200]   not in some sort of a transmogrification mode,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.120]   but a native Android and Apple run
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.360]   on this same $300 Chromebook.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.680]   So basically now we could have departments,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.840]   IT departments saying,
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.960]   if all these people that were sending out
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.520]   with notebooks need to do is to run Microsoft Office,
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.160]   the Android and version of Microsoft Office
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.120]   is plenty muscular for what they need to do,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.200]   so we're no longer going to even be approving purchases
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.120]   of laptops that cost more than $500.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.360]   We can buy them really good $300 notebooks,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.240]   and if they break, we can just simply give them
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.680]   a brand new one and they'll be up and running
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.520]   in a half an hour.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.600]   So it wouldn't surprise me if for,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.480]   maybe even for some time Apple has said,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.400]   we are not even gonna pretend
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.720]   that we can compete in any way, shape, or form
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.800]   with any sort of a budget or even early mid-level
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.440]   sort of machine, and if they simply said,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.960]   guess what, the cheapest notebook we will ever make
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.240]   is gonna be a thousand bucks,
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.280]   it's gonna be aluminum case,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.960]   it's gonna be built to our specifications,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.920]   and we understand that we're not gonna sell
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   any more computers really to education.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.080]   We'll work as hard as we can,
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.920]   but on some level we know that this is not
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.880]   where we're gonna be selling a lot of iPads and notebooks.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   - Can I point out that it's not clear,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.400]   but when they say Q4,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.400]   they may mean Apple's fiscal fourth quarter,
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.280]   which is actually July, August, September.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.160]   - Well, if we go back in history,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.800]   the new Mac Pro announced at WWC,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.120]   but didn't ship till the end of the year,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.160]   and they just wanted to give developers a hint of future.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   - But this could conceivably be announced
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.280]   in June and out in July, right?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.360]   I mean, that would fit this timeline, Q4, right?
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.720]   - Yeah, and it's not where you would think
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.680]   at that point that they would specify fiscal Q4
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.240]   as opposed to,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.040]   - Oh, maybe, yeah.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.400]   - You know, fourth quarter of the year.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.440]   - Okay, I mean, so it has happened
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.800]   that they've announced stuff that's not been out
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.880]   till the end of the year.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.560]   - Yeah.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   - Yeah, I mean, it's always better
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   when developers can run out and buy it right away,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.680]   and that's what makes it exciting for all of us.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.800]   It's like, almost like, I don't wanna get off
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.440]   in a tangent, but Google I/O didn't have a lot of stuff
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.640]   that was immediate, and people are like,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.040]   I want this, I can't see it,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.480]   and then they lose a little bit of immediate excitement.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.040]   But to the earlier point too,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.720]   with Apple and Education, it's really interesting
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.560]   because it's talking about unit numbers.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.200]   So the numbers of Chromebooks shipped
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.560]   as eclipsing the number of Mac books.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   - Not dollar, of course.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.640]   - No, not dollars.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.720]   And Apple has shown, like,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.080]   Michael Gartenberg did a really good article
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.680]   on this the other day because he was saying
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.800]   the perception is that Apple has to dominate a market
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.160]   in order to be successful.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.560]   When it's darkly, that's not the case.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.960]   iPod was an anomaly.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840]   Apple has never dominated the Mac market.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.800]   They've had, you know, single digit Mac share
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.760]   for a long, long, long time, and made billions of dollars.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.520]   And even iPhone, which is the most successful business
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.600]   in the history of non-petroleum products,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.200]   is not the market leader.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.640]   Doesn't dominate smartphone market,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680]   but it makes on godly amounts of money.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.960]   So Andy might be correct.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.640]   Apple might decide, like they did with Netflix,
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.600]   we want no part of this ultra cheap PC market.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.440]   We've projected that we can still, you know,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.320]   hit the be the most successful premium laptop on the market
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.560]   and make all the money and be super happy about it.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.000]   - Well, I think Apple's already made that decision.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.200]   They made that decision years ago.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   And they haven't wavered from what they said out years ago.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   You know, netbooks were not something that they wanted to do.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.480]   And I don't, I think that they're perfectly happy
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.320]   to just let the cheap phones, the cheap tablets,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.960]   the cheap computers go to other companies.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.040]   And they are gonna keep their standards.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.880]   And that's what we expect from Apple.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.400]   We expect standards to be high.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.240]   - That could be a problem though,
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.000]   or rather that could be a less successful way to thank
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.840]   in the next few years,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.480]   because it's not directly analogous to the situation
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.000]   with netbooks where a netbook was just a really,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.240]   really cheap ass Windows machine
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.440]   that nobody has ever used.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.320]   - In the Windows market, I think almost permanent.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.160]   - It hurt the Netflix app.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.760]   - It's not exactly.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.720]   It caused a lot of problems that way.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.080]   The problem with Chromebooks in regards to Apple though,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.800]   is that there is no, I've talked to a lot of mostly people
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.360]   who are IT and education.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.960]   And the impression I get from them is that they don't see a
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.640]   single category of their job that is not done better
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.400]   if they have a Chromebook,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.640]   because they're not being built like the way
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   that netbooks are being made.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.480]   They're not cheaply made.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.240]   They're actually built very, very nicely.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.120]   A lot of these manufacturers understand
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720]   that they're being issued to people who are,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   it's sort of like issuing the way that you design a car
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.400]   that's gonna be driven by cops,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.000]   versus the way you design a car,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.480]   but this can be driven by someone who owns it
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   and cares about it.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   So they're actually being made very, very durably.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.000]   But they find that it's not just that they,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.640]   not just that they're cheap,
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.240]   it's the fact that the administration tools are incredible.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.880]   The way that you can manage 100 devices
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.040]   and manage the content that's on there,
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.000]   is also incredible.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.800]   The software that Google gives you
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.840]   for managing classrooms and managing school systems
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.120]   is also incredible.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.360]   And so even if Apple,
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.400]   even if Chromebooks cost $700 and were made out of
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.840]   milled aluminum, the impression I get from these
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.440]   administrators is that they would still be buying
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.560]   Chromebooks and not MacBooks,
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.160]   because all of that stuff that helps them to do their jobs
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.440]   is not there for Mac.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.800]   Remember that just a few years ago,
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.720]   Apple has always been very, very serious
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.600]   about trying to sell iPads to schools,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.760]   that when they're doing a iBooks author,
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.000]   part of that was to at least in high school level
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.320]   and college level, to basically create a course
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.440]   where a market that would help them to sell iPads,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.400]   they still have teams out that helped administrators
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.760]   put iPads in education.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.200]   They still encourage third party manufacturers
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   to make these rack systems that can rack,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.240]   rack, secure and rack recharge classrooms full of iPads.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.000]   So this is a bigger problem because it's not just
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.560]   making cheaper hardware,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.320]   it's making a tool that suits the needs of the people
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.600]   who are buying these things.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.560]   And in education, I wanna make sure I'm limiting
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.840]   my comments to education.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.920]   In education, Apple is no longer making products
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   that suit that market's needs or those IT people's needs.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.520]   - So we're looking at one specific segment of the market
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   and I can't argue your points.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.400]   But I think if you look at what Apple is doing,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.800]   they're looking at a bigger picture.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   So Apple is selling great amounts of Macs, iPads,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.080]   iPhones, whatever it is,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.720]   but they're looking at what's coming next.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.800]   It's like the iPod, they were selling iPods,
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.680]   they were the high-end music maker.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.960]   They had no problem in coming out with an iPhone
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.800]   that acted as also an iPod.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   So when you look at the market that we have in education,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.160]   is Apple okay with losing some of that education market
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.840]   to hold on to its manufacturing standards all the while
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.080]   looking at what is the next big thing?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   I mean, is it this, the rumor car or is it something else?
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.120]   Ultimately, Apple has to make an overall profit
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.080]   for shareholders, that's what it has to do.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.840]   So it has to keep an eye on what's next in three years,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.680]   what's next in five years, 10 years,
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.320]   that's what they have to work towards.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.720]   And as long as they're doing that,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.040]   the company is gonna remain successful,
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.200]   just like they lost lots of market share
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   in the music players with the iPod over the years.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.600]   It doesn't really matter as a company
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.680]   because they gain so much market share in iPhones.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.440]   So I think that's kind of what they're looking at.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.800]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.080]   And so Apple is a powerful company
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.400]   by the only metric that matters.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.440]   They have the ability to do what they want to do
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.120]   and to steer towards the target that they wanna steer.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.480]   If they're on a market,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.520]   companies that are on really, really thin margins,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.960]   the next quarter could be the last quarter.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.360]   The next four quarters could be the last job
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.720]   that a lot of these CEOs will ever have,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.760]   whereas Apple can basically make a decision
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.960]   that doesn't have to pay off for another three, four,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.800]   or five years.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.160]   And they can also decide to say goodbye
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.240]   to a specific market,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.960]   no matter how profitable that market is,
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.240]   if they feel that the needs of that market
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.200]   are not suited to what their strengths are as a company.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.400]   Google can do an excellent job with Chromebooks
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.520]   because that's what they're really, really good at.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.440]   They're good at free software that works great.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.760]   So they're not gonna be quite so good
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.120]   at selling you a $1,500 notebook
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.480]   that makes you feel good about having spent $1,500
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.320]   on that notebook.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.600]   - Or a Pixel?
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.440]   - Yeah.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.120]   Beautiful device, but oh goodness gracious, it just doesn't.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.600]   (laughs)
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.800]   It's like I had one for three months
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.000]   and I had such love for the design.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.160]   It made me wish that my MacBook had some sharp corners on it.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.240]   And I love that the rainbow LEDs on the top of it,
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.400]   but if I had spent $12.99 on this,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.440]   I would think I really wish I'd spent $300
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.800]   on a Samsung Chromebook
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.320]   and then $1,000 on liquor and hotel rooms.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.560]   (laughs)
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.160]   - Maybe in that order.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.720]   - Well, I was glad to have bought the Pixel.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.640]   There is a $999 version of it you can buy with an i5.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.960]   And actually I use it all the time.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.800]   It's really good.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.640]   It's interesting,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.520]   because Apple's not going down without a fight in Maine.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.800]   I guess the Maine's Department of Education surveyed students
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.280]   and the students who were using iPads
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.000]   came in as well as teachers overwhelmingly in favor
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.840]   of replacing the iPads with laptops.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.760]   88.5% of teachers and 74% of students said,
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.840]   "We want keyboards."
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.680]   It's interesting,
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.520]   one of the kids said, "We need laptops.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.920]   "We need laptops.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.080]   "We need laptops.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.280]   "IPads are easier to play games on and get addicted to."
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.760]   So that's an interesting point of view.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.360]   So what Apple did is they came back to the--
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.080]   - We want computers that are less fun and--
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.240]   - This is too much fun, I'm addicted.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.720]   - Another thing that Windows and Google are very, very
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.200]   well optimized towards making people happy about it.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.040]   - Absolutely, in fact,
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.920]   that's one reason schools will probably turn off
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.760]   that Android Play Store feature on their laptops
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.840]   as well as many businesses on their Chromebooks
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.680]   'cause they don't--
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.720]   - Just anecdotally my God kids all have Chromebooks now
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.000]   in Google accounts in school.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.360]   And they thought it was great when they first got them
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.480]   and now the parents and the kids just think
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   it's the most horrible 'cause they're like K-47,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.560]   it's like Moscow.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.040]   But because they can't play,
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.240]   it's just, it's no fun to use,
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.880]   it looks ugly and drab because it's Google design stuff.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.480]   And they have to use it for work-at-a-work work,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.640]   which is the last thing they wanna do.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.480]   - Well here's what--
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   - So for them it's a horrible experience.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.560]   - Here's what Apple has actually initiated
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   with the state of Maine, a trade-in program,
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.800]   and they are gonna take the old iPads
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   and swap them from MacBook Airs.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.280]   So this is actually an interesting response
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.040]   and I think Apple's probably cutting them a deal
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.760]   'cause unless Maine somehow has a much more wealthy school
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.920]   school system than here in California,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.680]   which they may well,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.760]   that's a fairly expensive trade-up,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.280]   but they're gonna do it.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.200]   And schools can also have to get new iPads,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.280]   but I think what they're doing
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.760]   is they're offering grade seven through 12 the option.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.600]   Very interesting.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.240]   - I think kids' needs change as they grow older.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.080]   - Right.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.320]   - And it makes sense in high school, doesn't it?
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.440]   - Yeah, our needs change too.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.880]   My needs and the device that I use for my work
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.560]   changed throughout the day.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.120]   So I've said before that I like to put my computer
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.280]   down at the end of the day,
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.080]   but I still have work to do.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.960]   I use my 9.7-inch iPad Pro for that
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.160]   because it's very convenient, it's very mobile.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.400]   I, you know, that's what I like to use
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   at the end of the day.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.280]   So everybody's needs change when you're in education,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.920]   obviously I think the needs changes the kids get older
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.840]   and you need to adapt to that.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.680]   - Yep.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.280]   And also anything that the kids are using at junior high
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.760]   is not gonna be relevant when they're finishing high school,
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.440]   let alone when they're entering the job for.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   So getting focused on what specific kind of device
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.480]   they're using is not as important as what that thing
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.640]   can do for them and making sure that you can actually
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.600]   have enough for these people
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.640]   so that they don't have to wait for two hours
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.840]   so that Seth finishes on that one APL keyboard
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.160]   in the computer lab.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.760]   - Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.160]   That's our history.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.120]   That's the days we lived.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.800]   - But I need Fortran next.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   - I have all these cards, I need to run them
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.000]   through the card reader.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.280]   Come on, get off that machine, Seth.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.680]   All right, so exciting.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.240]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I for one would very much welcome a new.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.080]   - I've been waiting.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.520]   - I've used both the iPad Pro and I've used the MacBook
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.840]   but there's some things that especially video editing
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.320]   and just there's still some work things
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.360]   that I just, I love the MacBook Pro for.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.320]   And I've got the pre-touch, the pre-force touch MacBook,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.240]   13 inch right now.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.520]   And I love it because it's super light, super powerful.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.960]   So a new version of that machine is something
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.200]   I've been waiting really long time for.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.960]   - I thought Andy's commented about a MacBook Pro
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.760]   with a MacBook style keyboard was interesting.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.120]   Didn't sound like Andy liked it.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   I love the keyboard on the MacBook.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.560]   Love it.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.400]   - Yeah.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.240]   - Yeah.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.400]   - And the magic keyboard is different, I think Andy.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.640]   I think the magic manual like and the other one you want.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.800]   - Well, no, I've got the, I think that the last two
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.720]   keyboard designs that Apple has done,
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.760]   the magic keyboard and the keyboard on the MacBook,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.800]   I just think for my, I'm gonna, it's a subjective opinion
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.760]   but I think they're both terrible.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.720]   I think that the MacBook keyboard is practical
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.880]   for the sort of device it is.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.720]   So it's allowable on the MacBook Pro though.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.440]   If that were the keyboard that were built into it,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.960]   I really hate to say this but I'm gonna be honest,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   I would either try to limp by with my old MacBook
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.240]   for another couple of years to avoid using it
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.520]   or I would start to look at Windows machines.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.880]   - I hate somebody.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.800]   - It's not Andy's feed.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.060]   (laughing)
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.120]   No, no, and that's fine.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.320]   It's just, it's not a keyboard that I can,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.560]   you're talking about, and I may be outside the norm,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.320]   you're talking about somebody who on a slow day
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.480]   is only typing for three or four hours
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.920]   and on a really full day is typing for 10 or 11 hours.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.760]   There, it's a rare day that I'm not typing several thousand
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.400]   words or even close to 10,000 words onto a keyboard.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.480]   And so when you have something that's hard wired
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.240]   into the device, if that keyboard is terrible
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.720]   or if I don't like that keyboard, it's game over.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.920]   I would even, I would even rather have a non-retin
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.840]   display and using WordStar.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.040]   That's my Word processor.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.280]   If my fingers say, "Why are you doing this to us Andy?"
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.360]   "What did we do to make you hate us so much
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.880]   "that you're forcing us to use this terrible,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.440]   "terrible keyboard?"
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.040]   It's, I'll, you've heard me say this before,
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   so I'll all say is that it would disappoint me if,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.320]   once again, if I were to win the half billion dollar lottery,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.280]   walk into the Apple Store literally with a wheelbarrowful
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.040]   of money saying, "Give me your top of the line MacBook.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.080]   "Money is no object.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.160]   "I can pay you as much as a hundred thousand dollars
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.960]   "for your very best laptop."
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.120]   And they hand me something that has a marginal keyboard
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.200]   and not a whole lot of ports.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.400]   And it's just, they tell me, "Well, but it's so thin."
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.200]   I think, "This is the best you can give me."
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   This ATM machine style keyboard, this Fisher price,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.680]   busy time, baby's busy box keyboard.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.280]   Look, wheelbarrow full of money.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.160]   I will give you, no, that's the best we can do for you.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.880]   I think the MacBook Pro should be among the best black.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.200]   Probably even possibly by you.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.280]   Styles should have almost nothing to do with it.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.120]   But it's not style for me.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   The keyboard on the MacBook, on the 12 inch MacBook,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.400]   I think is the best keyboard that's ever been released.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.280]   Really?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.680]   I love that keyboard.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.640]   You know that you're atypical.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.760]   Well, in many ways, literally.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.320]   (laughing)
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.560]   But I mean, I don't begrudge you.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.440]   You could have any, you know,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.920]   you should have whatever keyboard you want.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.760]   I can take a break when we come back.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   This is HP's Windows 10, alas, response to the MacBook.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.000]   They say thinner, it's not.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.800]   It's thinner on the edges,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.920]   but a little bit thicker in the middle.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.760]   But roughly--
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.600]   It's thinner on the outside.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.520]   Yeah, it's kind of misleading.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.280]   But all of these are tapered edges, you know.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.600]   So it's got the thinnest tapered edge.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.640]   Somebody cut off Leo's feed, bud.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   Two and a half.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.320]   (laughing)
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.080]   You're gonna be all alone soon.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.240]   Just me you and Renee.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   I don't care about the,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.920]   I use all kinds of keyboards and I don't know,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.760]   like after a moment,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   I don't notice a difference anymore.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.400]   The only reason I bring this up is because this is,
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.440]   same, you know, issues that Apple had to deal with
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.400]   in making the MacBook.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.560]   In other words, weight and size were critical.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.720]   It's a little bit bigger because it's a 13 inch screen
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.840]   instead of a 12 inch screen.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.680]   It's not retina either, by the way, it's 1080p
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.400]   and it has much worse battery life.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.760]   But they had the same issues with keys.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   They decided they have to go with the standard kind of
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   wobbly springs, not that,
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.440]   the solid springs that Apple did.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.880]   And I, and the travel's the same, I guess,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.240]   but I really like this keyboard.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.800]   I think I prefer it to the MacBook keyboard.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.680]   It's a little more of a traditional keyboard.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.400]   You get used to the wobbly-ness, like when I go back,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   I notice that it's stable.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.840]   I don't mind the wobbly-ness.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.920]   That's what all keyboards were like.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.680]   Right?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.200]   But Jim likes the stable keyboard, so.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.720]   I do like the stable keyboard.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.520]   I think it took a few days, used to, to be honest,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.560]   because when you press down on a key on the new MacBook,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.880]   the key goes straight down.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.720]   It doesn't have that wobbly.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.560]   Right.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.520]   And you automatically think,
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.440]   "Wow, I didn't hit a key there."
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.320]   But when you look, you actually did.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.200]   That's my problem with these.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.920]   I just, now I just type like crazy.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   Right. And every thing is there.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.760]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   And like Andy, you know, I type a lot and, and Renee too,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.160]   and probably YouTube Leo.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.800]   We type a lot every day.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.400]   And being comfortable with that keyboard is very important.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.600]   It's a big deal. Yeah.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.440]   So when I go back to the MacBook Pro that I have,
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.160]   and those keys are so small,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.920]   and by the way, that is the only complaint
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.840]   that I have with the 9.7 inch iPad Pro,
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.680]   was the keyboard on the smart cover.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.840]   They have lots of room, and I said,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.680]   "Why couldn't you make the keys bigger
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.040]   like you do on the MacBook?"
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.920]   That's what I wanted, you know?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   But clearly, I'm not like everybody else.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.200]   No, but that's nice to have the choice.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.080]   And I think Apple made a strong case for that keyboard.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.520]   I find I still make mistakes with it.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.080]   And that's, and that comes from exactly what you did
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.040]   describe the issue, which is,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.440]   I know I've hit a key on the wobbly keys
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.200]   or the keys with bigger travel.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.240]   That's why some of us like those buckling spring keyboards.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.520]   They give you strong feedback.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.160]   And on the MacBook, I miss keys
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.240]   because I'm not sure if I hit it or not.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.520]   You got to mean it, Leo.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.600]   I do. I actually have to pound that keyboard to me.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.760]   Like when I met, 'cause I always screw up the password
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.720]   the first time, right?
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.320]   So then I go boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.680]   It's like the second serve after a net.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.360]   You wanna, you kind of make sure that gets in.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.040]   And I feel like that's why I don't like that keyboard
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.440]   as much, but I think you certainly do get much more use
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.560]   to it. And Lisa loves it.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.720]   She's like you, Jim.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.560]   My wife loves it.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.880]   In fact, she's on our second MacBook.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.040]   She wanted the pink one.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.320]   See, she's a very smart lady.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.400]   Smart woman.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.280]   Genius. Yeah.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.600]   Yeah. I'm sure not saying it.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.480]   And you have to like what you like.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   And you don't have to defend liking what you like.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.720]   It would just disappoint me that if they decided to,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.520]   if you're gonna redesign the keyboard to make it flat,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.000]   I think that you need to give me something as a consumer
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.840]   as a result of that.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   And if you're making, again, a MacBook Pro
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.760]   where I'm willing to make it, I'm willing to,
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   I'm willing to have a thicker device.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.880]   I'm looking to have a device that's a little bit heavier
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.280]   because I want the creature comforts of having this as my,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.720]   my desktop device is my mobile device is everything.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.120]   I'm willing to sacrifice, but I have to sacrifice for that.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.360]   If it is not possible for me to buy a MacBook
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.680]   that has a keyboard that I like on it
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.000]   because they use the exact same keyboard,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.080]   key switch technology and all of them,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   that I think is a problem.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.640]   I also think that that's, I don't know,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.720]   that's, there are signature advantages
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.600]   and signature disadvantages to every single major tech
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.400]   company's design aesthetic.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.000]   The, a signature disadvantage of Apple is that we decide
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.080]   what is the best and if you don't like it too bad,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   you're gonna have to get used to it.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.200]   You'll get, you'll, you hear that a lot that,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.920]   oh well, you'll get used to the new keyboard.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.440]   Well, I don't want to get used to the new keyboard.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.080]   I want the keyboard that I like.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.560]   - Well then you get a MacBook Pro.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.680]   - You get a, well I'll get a look at this one.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.600]   If they don't, if the MacBook Pro decides to use these
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.840]   incredibly low profile keys,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.160]   just for the sake of consistency across the liner
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.800]   because they decided that, again, nobody ever stood up
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.080]   and cheered at an Apple event and said,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.440]   and we made the new MacBook a half a millimeter thinner.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.280]   You're welcome.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.120]   - Yay!
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   - That's how you know how many,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.520]   but percentage of the crowd is actually like Apple employees.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.680]   When you say that, okay, that's the company's biggest
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.240]   strength is often as big as weakness too.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.200]   And it's very hard to balance that.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.600]   - This is interesting because remember I was talking
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.720]   about ordering this and at the same time I was ordered
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.840]   Alisa's MacBook because they also, same size,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.560]   same form factor, they did, I think,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.760]   sacrifice the battery size in order to get
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.640]   three Type-C connectors.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.920]   But then HP is something that just,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   this is the hell out of me.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.600]   You can't charge it with any other Type-C charger
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.800]   but HP's are obviously checking.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.560]   That's just frustrating as hell.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.680]   You can charge it in all three ports,
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.240]   but it has to be an HP charger.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.840]   And the MacBook I can use any Type-C charger with,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.680]   that's fine.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.240]   The other thing they did, which I do like,
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   is this, these two extra ports support Thunderbolt 3.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.080]   And I'm getting a lot of speed out of the Thunderbolt 3.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.520]   It's nice, not nearly as fast as the internal SSD.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.800]   That's super fast, that's an NVMe SSD.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.160]   So if you, I guess if you could live with Windows 10,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   it's a nice design.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   I mean, it's very MacBook-y, which is interesting to me.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.080]   They obviously see that as a design to emulate.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.760]   We wanna talk more.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.400]   Jim Dowrymple's here from Loop Insight.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.440]   And I know there's a big party coming up with Jim and Renee.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.840]   And they'll tell you about that in a second.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.000]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.640]   Our show today brought to you by,
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   I love the name of this company,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   the Ministry of Supply.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.360]   It's very 1984.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.840]   Maybe that's why Mac people should love it.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.560]   What they're saying is,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.600]   and I think this fits the geek in all of us.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.280]   Closing should be designed for functionality.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.480]   It should be smart.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.240]   It should be designed for the needs of a body in motion,
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.320]   not for some static mannequin.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.960]   And this is the Ministry of Supply,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.640]   created out of MIT.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.000]   It's a performance professional menswear company.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.120]   They make polished business clothes
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.320]   that are engineered by MIT-trained engineers.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.520]   So it's interesting use of fabrics, for instance.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.720]   They choose fabrics that'll wick the sweat away from your body.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.480]   It'll regulate your body temperature,
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.920]   keeping it from getting too hot or too cold.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.240]   They move freely.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.080]   I got the Ministry of Supply shorts.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.160]   Actually, I bought them before they started advertising here.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.840]   And I love them because they fit.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.240]   They don't use buttons.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.120]   They use this unique kind of attachment
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.000]   that it really is great.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.120]   It took me a little while to figure out,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.720]   because I didn't go to MIT.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.320]   But once I figured it out, I love it.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.520]   They never come loose.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.840]   Take a look at the Aviator 2 suit.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.320]   You're seeing that on the left of you're watching the screen.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.880]   Moss co-founder Guihan, they call themselves Moss, Ministry
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.480]   Supply, broke the Guinness world record
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.840]   for the fastest half marathon wearing a suit.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.920]   He ran it in the Aviator 2.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.440]   And just to show that it is a suit that looks great
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.800]   at a business meaning, but it's comfortable enough
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.080]   to run a marathon.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.840]   And it was designed around the human body in motion
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.640]   instead of woven fabric.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.480]   It uses something called warp knit.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.280]   I've never heard of this.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.960]   It's extremely lightweight, very flexible.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.480]   I bought an Aviator 2 Blazer 2, which I love.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.200]   It's perfect for travel.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.640]   This is what I got both the shorts and the suit for is travel,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.400]   because it keeps its shape, keeps its structure,
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.640]   even while it's allowing you to move around.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   They have the new traditional dress collar shirt.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.120]   So if you're expected to wear a nice dress collar shirt,
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.000]   temperature regulating phase change materials, what?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.560]   The what?
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.880]   It's a NASA invention.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.760]   It stores and releases body heat based
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.240]   on surrounding climate.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.680]   You're basically wearing a space suit.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.040]   It makes me want to try it.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.840]   Doesn't it?
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.280]   Is that not awesome?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.400]   I will get you some.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.720]   We'll send you some, Jim.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.400]   Laser cut ventilation at the arms, underarms
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.920]   to keep the air flowing.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.360]   It's a dress shirt that looks and feels
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.920]   like a traditional dress shirt, but it
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.280]   is state of the art modern.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.600]   Ministry of supply.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.000]   Look at that.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.200]   I mean, that is a beautiful shirt.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.560]   I think it's a gorgeous looking shirt.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.920]   Here, show my-- the one I'm holding here real quick.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.440]   I got it here.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.680]   You got the over the shoulder shot.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.960]   I just want people to see it in real life.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.040]   There we go.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   These are gorgeous shirts.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.920]   You'd be happy to wear this is the Gemini laser cut,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.600]   underarm venting laser cut, bonded construction, phase
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.120]   change materials, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic fibers
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.400]   from moisture wicking.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.200]   I guess they put the hydrophobic--
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.280]   what, on the outside, and hydrophobic on the inside?
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.360]   I don't know how they do it.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.600]   It's MIT, man.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.800]   Don't ask.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.920]   This is ministryofsupply.com/macbreak.

[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.600]   coming soon to DC.

[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.840]   I heard it on Macbreak, and you get 15% off your first purchase
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.760]   there, too.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.520]   Ministry of supply.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.000]   They won't let me take this home yet.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.400]   This is the-- no, I'm so excited.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.600]   We have to keep it for the ads.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.080]   But this is the sweater I picked.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.640]   I was going to say, if you have a shirt as beautiful as that,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.760]   and you're wearing the Technicolor--
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.240]   I know.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.480]   --the Inter-Macs loo out there.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.680]   They won't let me take them home yet.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.320]   No, wait, Leo.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.560]   I saw on Twitter that you have no problem just going shirtless
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.880]   for half the show.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.440]   What are you talking about?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.200]   What are you talking about?
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.120]   Do they have t-shirts?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.320]   I don't-- yeah, I think they do.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   They do.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.680]   Yes, they do.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.200]   Because I wear t-shirts.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.120]   No, you would-- it's really--
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.360]   the theory behind it is kind of like you have to go to work,
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.200]   and you have to wear dressy shirts and stuff.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.720]   Boom.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.640]   But shouldn't they be nice?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.200]   But yeah, the t-shirts are awesome.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.560]   Would you like that?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.400]   Right there.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   You lost a lot of weight.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.520]   What size am I going to send?
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.200]   Large.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   Large.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Not XL.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.160]   Not an L room for the beard.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.400]   OK.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.480]   We'll see the beard can go under or in,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.920]   because it's hydrophobic and hydrophilic.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.640]   The core-- OK, we're going to get the core
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   crunex in black, large for gym.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.440]   OK?
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.640]   Make a note of that.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.080]   Boom.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.960]   Boom.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.520]   Boom.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.280]   Can I-- I just--
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.960]   What would you like, Andy?
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.360]   I'll take the core crunex.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.560]   OK, we'll get one for everybody.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.760]   You want one too, right?
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.760]   Sure.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.440]   I want to do a matching show one.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.600]   We'll be like a get us all small.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   Get some of the Marshall's shirt, Mac Break.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.480]   Simon Powell, we all sit like this.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   A good show.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.160]   I will say that I discovered engineered fabrics
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.000]   and engineered shirts just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.080]   And just the idea of their fabrics
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.400]   that are designed to really work with whatever humidity,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.760]   whatever temperatures, it's not too-- it's like in the '60s
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.160]   here today, but it's really, really humid.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.240]   And I went out for breakfast, and I was wearing a cotton T-shirt
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.280]   that was just like--
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.280]   Oh.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.080]   It was like 18 pounds heavier.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.240]   And so I just-- I just got this shirt--
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.040]   this isn't a ministry of supply, but I just got this shirt
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.080]   like in the mail, like--
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.960]   There aren't any new materials out there that are amazing.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.440]   Immediately changed.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:44.960]   Immediately changed.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   Immediately changed.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.600]   Immediately changed.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.400]   Immediately changed into it out of this T-shirt.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.720]   And suddenly, oh my god, I'm so--
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.400]   I don't feel any colder than I was like a minute ago.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.640]   But now, for the entire morning, I'm working.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.560]   And I don't feel as though I'm in Louisiana
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.240]   gigging frogs or something.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.480]   I got them for Jiu-Jitsu because rash guards were so tight
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.840]   all the time, and these are the Uteas,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.320]   and they were much looser and nicer.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:04.840]   Right.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.000]   Well, I love this shirt, but it's made in Mexico,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.400]   and it's very heavy.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.200]   It's gorgeous.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.400]   It's from Sammy Galde, and they went over a few years.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.440]   He's a mass macho.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.360]   Yeah, a Wynton Churchill, some of them, four or five of them.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.840]   But they're made of very thick cotton.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.480]   And I don't know how they wear them in Mexico.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   If it's humid, this thing is like absorbing the water.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.800]   It's like it gets heavier.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.080]   So yeah.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.840]   We don't have to wear cotton anymore.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.280]   We have better.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.960]   Coming back from the ad now, that was a little--
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.600]   just a little--
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.240]   It's a product so great.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.560]   Sometimes an ad speaks for our individual pain.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.600]   Well, I'll be honest.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.360]   We turned out a lot of advertisers
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.520]   because we say our audience wouldn't be interested.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.160]   But so we're always looking for advertisers.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.160]   This is kind of the old-fashioned way of it.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.520]   Instead of doing a lot of snooping on you
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.680]   and figuring out what you're interested in,
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.160]   we just do such narrow programming
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.280]   and we kind of know.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.600]   You'd be interested in this.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.040]   So we try to pick stuff that you'd be interested in.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.480]   So Gary Sullivan, a Tumillah, Iowa, this next ad is--
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.160]   This one's for you.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.520]   Have you ever noticed that not all places will make pizza
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.840]   that have exactly the right amount of ground beef?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.680]   Well, Gary.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.440]   Did you read Marcos--
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   I know you all read Marco's blog post.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.240]   If Google's right about AI, that's a problem for Apple.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.480]   Now, he didn't say it's going to be.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.320]   He said there's a potential issue.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.200]   Apple, he likened to BlackBerry right before the iPhone came out.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.240]   Google's been working hard on machine learning for a decade
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.200]   now and has certain advantages there.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.280]   For one, they're willing to mine your data
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.040]   to get better at machine language.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.040]   Apple, of course, is much more reluctant to do that.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.720]   What did you think of the article, Renee?
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.120]   I wrote a hot take on it this morning, of course,
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.720]   because I had to.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.000]   I feel such sympathy for Marco because he takes what
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.080]   is, in essence, a community discussion
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.000]   and he lasers down to it.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.920]   And then in the most sensational way possible,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.640]   all the usual suspects link to it
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.000]   and try to incite riots based on it.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.560]   So I think his core point is highly interesting.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.960]   BlackBerry is a hard example to make.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.280]   It's a good one because they went from being the major smartphone
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.040]   player to not being the major smartphone player.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   But the reasons were very specific to BlackBerry.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.560]   They really thought to the core of their being
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.600]   that hardware keyboards and data compression
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   were the keys to success in the future.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.080]   They never saw multi-touch and mobile broadband coming.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.520]   They wasted a year making playbooks
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.360]   that nobody wanted, in essence, stopped making phones.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.200]   And then they had a really hard time
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.720]   trying to make Q and X into a consumer-friendly operating
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.280]   system, and Apple faces absolutely none of those problems.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.080]   Also, Apple has been doing machine learning
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.000]   for half a decade and more.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.320]   Apple has a whole bunch of people that work on machine
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.600]   learning.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.680]   So whether they're behind or not is a function
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.760]   of how you-- if you believe that Google is doing machine
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   learning in a way that not only Apple can't do,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.840]   but in a way that will be so fundamentally better, that Apple--
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.320]   and this is where the BlackBerry analogy works--
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.240]   that Apple falls into a relevancy.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.760]   And their BBM is maybe a better example
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.080]   because WhatsApp just decimated BBM.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.720]   And maybe Windows Mobile is a good example
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.880]   because Microsoft still has tons of money.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.400]   They're very successful, but nobody cares about Microsoft
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.240]   on mobile anymore.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.840]   It just fell off the radar.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.720]   And it's not that people stopped buying BlackBerrys.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.200]   They stopped even thinking about buying BlackBerrys,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.240]   which is a much worse problem to have.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.640]   So I think if it's true that Apple is far behind in machine
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.560]   learning, and there's some things to suggest that,
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.720]   but there's some things like, again, I can go to my Apple TV
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.000]   and in French ask it to play me an English movie,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.680]   and it does.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.760]   And that's very rare.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.240]   And they can do that in Mandarin or Hebrew
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.600]   in a whole bunch of different languages.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.360]   Apple is actually ahead in some areas, especially compared
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.880]   to a company like Amazon.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.680]   We have a skewed perspective of that.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.000]   So I think there's absolutely points of caution,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.440]   and there's absolutely merit to that argument.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   But I also think it's important that, for example,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.040]   I don't want Google mining my data.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.680]   And as a consumer, even if I have a lesser service,
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.000]   to many people, the convenience will far outweigh
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.120]   any privacy or security concerns.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.960]   They just won't care.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.560]   They just want the awesome technology.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.840]   But if there are people, just like keyboards,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.360]   if there are people who want that level of privacy,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.240]   I think it's really important that a company like Apple
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.480]   or somebody provides them with an alternative.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.880]   And I'll say, I'm willing to give up a little bit of this
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   for a lot of that.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.720]   And I'm happy that I have that option.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.760]   Well, that was a lot of talks.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.200]   Are they all?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.760]   No, no.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.040]   No, options are good.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.680]   And options are important.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.800]   I think that, again, Apple has the ability
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.440]   to do whatever it is they want to do.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.960]   And if they had bet wrong on the importance of features
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.920]   like what Google were demonstrating at Google I/O last week,
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.560]   they can either take something that has been a back burner
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.280]   project and suddenly give it next keynote relevance
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.960]   and next keynote funding and personnel,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.400]   or they can just buy it.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.920]   And it will be like Google Maps, where
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.240]   it's going to be a tough public vlogging for a couple years,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.200]   but eventually they'll get to where they need to go.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   And they've got plenty of time to figure that out.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.680]   The bigger problem would be if they
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.280]   are philosophically not willing to make products that
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.520]   are in services that are relevant to people.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.040]   If they are so fixated on--
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.800]   I'll pull this out only because it's continuity--
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   but it's like, no, no, no.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.360]   We don't think that people care about full travel keyboards.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.280]   I'll cross the line.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.440]   I think they want that really cool styling
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.640]   that we can get from this.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.280]   And people are saying, well, no, if we like our Macs more
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.400]   than we hate your keyboards, that's
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.560]   the only reason why we're doing that.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.200]   If they are starting to--
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.680]   it's going to be interesting, as I was watching
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.360]   the Google I/O keynote, which I thought
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.680]   was one of the strongest tech keynotes in the past three
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.800]   or four years.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.480]   I was thinking about what Apple could introduce at WWDC
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.920]   and what they couldn't introduce in the next iPhone.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.960]   And thinking that Google's keynote
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.480]   was full of here are practical ways
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.320]   in which we're going to make your phone a lot easier to use.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.720]   Here are problems that you face every single day
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.480]   that we are solving, not with new hardware,
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   but by simply giving you the next free update
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.760]   to your operating system.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.880]   If Apple's next keynote is--
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.200]   and we now have this new LED strip that's
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.680]   going to be touch sensitive that a programmer has supported,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.960]   we'll let people do this.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.400]   Force Touch is wonderful, but it's not essential.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.600]   And it requires you to buy a new piece of hardware.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   My new MacBook that I bought a few months ago, of course,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.080]   has Force Touch.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.160]   I like that it's there.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.720]   I like the technology behind it.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.680]   But the thing is, I don't really use Force Touch.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.920]   It's not really helpful me out.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.480]   If Apple's road is still that we're
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.600]   going to make them the really nice high end premium, high markup
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.560]   devices, and all of the really cool stuff that we do
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.880]   involves your buying new hardware.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.920]   And it won't be these magical things
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.320]   that make you instantly wish, oh my god,
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.640]   I wish my phone had Force Touch so I could press a little bit
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.800]   harder and get a pop up menu.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.520]   If they're not willing to respond to that, I'm not saying
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.960]   Apple is doomed, but that would be a point in which Apple
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.320]   has to decide, do you want to continue to be Apple,
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.480]   or are you going to be content to be bang on Olafson?
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.720]   A company that is very, very respected, very, very profitable.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.080]   Excuse me, I believe it's very profitable.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   Big stuff that's highly respected,
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.160]   but it's still you don't know any, but not terribly relevant
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.800]   to what most people want in terms of that kind of consumer
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   hardware.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.560]   In a way, though, couldn't this be an opportunity for Apple
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.360]   to say, look, we protect your privacy.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.480]   We're not going to mine your data.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.280]   OK, yes.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.120]   That means Siri will never be as good as, OK, Google,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.160]   in some respects, but wouldn't you
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   prefer to use a more private platform?
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.480]   Yeah, but the thing is, Apple, I think
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.840]   it would be a mistake to behave as though Google is
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.120]   the only company that's keeping an eye on your data.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.920]   Your car is collecting your data.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   Your cable box, Netflix is collecting your data.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.560]   Every website that you hit is collecting your data.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.320]   When you take advantage of the two-for-one sale
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.080]   on potato chips on Memorial Day with your discount card,
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.480]   at the market, your market is collecting your data.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.800]   My position on this is the same as it's always been.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.360]   I think that Google offers you a transaction in which they
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.480]   are willing to collect data from you on the basis that we
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.800]   will keep that data secure and private.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.360]   We will never sell information about you.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.880]   We will simply use that of what we learn about you to steer
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.360]   better ads towards you.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.880]   So an outside advertiser will never
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.640]   be able to find out more about me and I do not go,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.600]   but they will be able to find out.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.640]   They will be able to make sure that an ad intended for a nerd
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.520]   in their mid-40s who wears glasses and wears hats a lot.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.600]   We'll get the hat ad.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.280]   And in exchange for that, they will get a suite of services
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.840]   that the user can either find useful or not find useful.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.320]   And on that basis, I feel as though, for me--
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.800]   I can only speak for me--
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.320]   I think they give a very, very valuable suite of services.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.200]   One of the things that-- and the stuff I saw last week at Google
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.160]   I/O--
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.280]   point after point after point after point--
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.760]   I was thinking, oh, I wish my phone could do that right now.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.840]   Oh, I wish my phone could-- oh, I wish I had that device.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.680]   Oh, wouldn't it be great if my device did that?
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.360]   I can't wait for Android N to come out.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.960]   And for me, that is a good transaction.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.800]   What I don't like is people who aren't as sensible as Renee,
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.520]   who say that, you know, with Google, you are the product.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.000]   With Apple, they're incident only selling phones.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.520]   Like, well, yeah, they're interested in--
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   they're optimized towards making sure
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.680]   that they will make a phone that is worth the markup
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.800]   that they have to charge for.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.400]   They're interested in selling laptops that are worth the markup
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.560]   that they have to charge for.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.840]   They're not interested in, again, selling a $300 notebook
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.000]   that is going to be as useful as at least 80% to 85%
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.040]   of the notebooks that are on the market today.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.160]   So it's a transaction.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.520]   You have to make an informed decision,
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.480]   but I don't think that anybody's foolish for making
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.440]   the decision that they would much rather give all that personal data
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   to Google if it means that I get every advantage of Google now
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.840]   and I get every advantage I have on my Android Wear watch
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.960]   that would not be possible with an Apple device.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.920]   Jim, what do you think?
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   Wow.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   I mean, you're an iPhone user.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   Andy's an Android user.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.440]   Do you look over at that side with envy?
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.000]   Or as Andy does with anticipation about things
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.280]   that are going to come to your phone?
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.360]   The one thing that I did find that was pretty cool about Google
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.000]   I/O, I/O, was that it could identify what
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.200]   was happening in a picture.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.520]   So if you sent a graduation picture,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.720]   it would come up with recommended responses
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.240]   like, oh, congratulations, or you look great.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.680]   I don't know what would happen if you sent a picture of you just
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.480]   waking up in the morning when it came back and say,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.920]   you look horrible or--
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.000]   But it did seem to know, based on the content of the picture,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.680]   what a recommended response should be.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.960]   That's kind of cool.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:15.200]   But I think it's important that we split the conversation,
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.040]   especially with this--
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.720]   the new AI stuff is that there's the consumer level
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.840]   and the tech level.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.400]   I mean, from a tech point, if we split the tech people out,
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.040]   we're all impressed with new things that can be done.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.640]   But if you look at a consumer, they
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.880]   look at it differently than what we do.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.440]   They want convenience.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.640]   And that's why iTunes was so successful,
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.440]   because it was just convenient.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.080]   You could go in and just buy a song.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:44.880]   You hear a song?
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.380]   Buy.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.880]   Done.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.120]   It's you own it now.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.280]   It's yours.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.240]   And I think with Siri and with what Google's doing,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.680]   having so many iPhones out there, I
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.520]   think Apple does have a responsibility
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.720]   to make Siri better.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.360]   And I think that they will.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.400]   But just being able to press that button on your iPhone
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   and use that service is good enough for a lot of people.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.280]   So I think there are two different ways
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.080]   to look at this whole argument between Google and Alexa
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.120]   and Siri.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:25.160]   And a lot of it has to do with what's good for the consumer.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.480]   And what we look at is the tech community.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.960]   There's a lot of it.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.960]   Go ahead.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.040]   I was going to say, yeah, I had a very different reaction
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.640]   to Google I/O. And to Jim's point, I'm a techy.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.600]   I thought the technology that they showed
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.240]   was far better than how they explained it.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.280]   Like, for example, when they were talking about Allo,
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.040]   they basically said it could do it.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.640]   It could do sequential inference, which we've all had for five years.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.000]   But it does so much more than that.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.120]   And that wasn't really fully expanded upon.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.400]   The Assistant stuff is a whole ton of Assistant stuff.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.720]   And this does a lot of unique stuff.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.280]   But it was given a very low level explanation.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.360]   And I met some Google engineer friends afterwards
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.480]   because they were all in South Bay at the same time I was,
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.840]   because Google had the actual event in South Bay
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.080]   for the first time.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.280]   And we were sort of joking around,
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.680]   is what does this really mean when we have this sort of bot
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.640]   integration?
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.720]   So for example, if I message Jim and Jim's like, I like
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.960]   many, but I'm kind of busy now and he's annoying me.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.640]   Why don't you handle them for a while?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.400]   Is that me picking those predicted responses?
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.720]   You just pick the right ones.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.480]   Now, make sure you don't add any calendar appointments.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.240]   There's not offer that, by the way, as a feature.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.720]   But that was a few people wanted it.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.080]   Like, mother-in-law is trying to entertain--
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.640]   Do you know who you're talking to?
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.440]   Is it Jim or is it his bot?
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.000]   I mean, some people entertain mother-in-law for 10 minutes.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And it just goes and does it.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.080]   But then, in-box--
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.360]   Does this already, by the way, Google's email inbox.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.680]   And it does a surprisingly good and nuanced job of giving
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   the right response, one that even sounds like it's
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.800]   from my own voice.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.960]   And I guess I gather it's kind of--
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.560]   And by the way, how does it do that?
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.040]   Reading your email.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.720]   And by doing that, it can come up with something
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.600]   that I think you might have nailed a grenade.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.960]   That's something they could conceivably offer.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.600]   And then, after a minute, mother-in-law
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.040]   is like, oh, he's kind of boring,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.200]   but I don't want to be rude to him.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   So she presses the button.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.560]   And then those two bots-- like, there's two bots
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.240]   talking in the forest.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.760]   No, never.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.440]   The rest of the-- for 100 years.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.760]   It'll become Microsoft Day, too.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.080]   It'll just be beautiful.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:26.000]   Well, I saw a lot of really good practical--
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.960]   I think some of the best technology is the sort of stuff
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.520]   where you are in a group of people
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.400]   and you have different phones or different devices,
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   where you're visiting someone else's house who
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.480]   have different gear.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.880]   And you notice them doing things that you wish you could do
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.280]   with your own stuff.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.080]   And Aloe is definitely in that category,
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.000]   because it's stuff like having a chat with--
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.720]   how many times have you had a chat with people who you're
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.320]   trying to figure out where to go out for dinner?
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.640]   And just the ability to bring in a bot into the chat
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.840]   and ask, well, what are restaurants that are--
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.000]   restaurants that are near us are going to be open after 10.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.800]   And the bot comes back, conversationally,
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.200]   well, we have this, this, and that.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.800]   Do any of those have a really, really good beer list
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.640]   with a lot of like home local beers?
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.120]   Well, this one and this one.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.480]   Oh, great.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.320]   What were the prices of the place B?
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.080]   And so, well, the price B, typical entree,
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.280]   is about $12, $18.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:20.560]   Oh, great.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.040]   Can you make us a reservation?
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.080]   And then not only is it making a reservation,
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.200]   but it's also allowing open table or whatever other thing
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   to push without my having the open table app or the Yelp
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.040]   app or anything on the device to push from Google Play
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.080]   just that bit of Android code that
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.520]   gives me a really rich environment for placing
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.120]   a reservation at that place in time.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.920]   That's the sort of stuff that it doesn't--
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.600]   you don't have to know how good the engine in this car
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.360]   is to understand that it runs better than my 1999 Buick
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.160]   Elector or whatever I'm doing.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.280]   They're showing off a lot of things
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.760]   that were very, very practical in that way.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.480]   And so I think that that's the sort of stuff
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.280]   that I would like to see Apple start to show off.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.800]   I think the last two or three keynotes,
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.400]   there haven't been as many really wow moments like that.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.600]   Even with the Apple Watch, what they're showing off here
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.880]   is this new thing.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.680]   And it is a platform for apps.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.000]   And it will track your stuff.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:19.640]   And we'll do this.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.280]   And we'll do your activity.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.920]   But they weren't showing that here is a problem
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.520]   that you're having that this watch will then solve for you.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.400]   The iPad Pro was a little bit better.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.280]   But we're talking about a big, broad hardware platform.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.520]   So that's kind of hard to do.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.160]   I really hope that when they show off the next version of iOS
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   and the same version of macOS, they really
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.360]   can show stuff with, say, Siri, where I can solve a problem
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.440]   really, really quickly and really, really accurately.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.040]   Again, watching I/O, so many points, just the ability to do--
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.080]   how many times have I been out in public,
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.520]   whether I'm on the subway or just on the street corner?
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:57.200]   And I want to be able to say, hey, hey, Shlomo,
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.480]   are there any drugstores near me right now that
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.320]   have that ongoing for that rash that I haven't been able to get
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.240]   rid of?
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.360]   And you don't want to say stuff like that,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.640]   or even appointments, like a schedule, a meeting for next
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.280]   Thursday.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.440]   The ability to simply in the L.O. window,
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.680]   to simply type schedule an appointment for next Thursday
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.920]   with this person, that person, or that other person,
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.680]   and have access to that natural language interface
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.040]   without having to speak it aloud.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.360]   Just that alone, I think, well, that's
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.200]   the feature that I'm going to use a lot.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.160]   And that's also going to be a feature
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.160]   that people are going to be able to use on iOS
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.880]   because it's going to be multi-platform.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.520]   So like I said, I want to make sure
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.240]   that Apple is not losing sight of--
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.040]   while they're trying to make their $3,000 laptop that's
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.840]   already too big to put in a back pocket, one millimeter
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.280]   thinner.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.080]   And they think that that's a really wonderful thing
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.480]   that everyone's going to respond to.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.760]   And I know that it drives them and it drives their curiosity.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.040]   But I want to make sure that as an iPad user, as a Mac user,
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.520]   they're making the assortment of announcements
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.720]   that get me really, really excited about using my iPad
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.800]   in September and October when the next version of the operating
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.240]   system comes out.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.000]   Jim, Andy, you're forgetting that last WW you see,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.560]   they gave me the ability to say, hey,
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.800]   Siri, play the Glee version of Smooth Criminal,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.600]   and it just does.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.720]   It just does.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.040]   OK, well, that's--
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.480]   Problem solved.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.320]   OK.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.840]   If you were saying the Alien Ant Farm version of Smooth Criminal,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   I'd be with you.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.520]   I've moved on to Glee.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.920]   I find a duck Jim punching me now.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.000]   Trying to listen well.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.200]   Anything that makes it easier to get to either Prince
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.240]   or Michael Jackson, I'll have to say
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.120]   that is a big step forward.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.880]   One thing that Apple did-- sorry, Google announced that nobody
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.400]   really picked up on, but I thought
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:43.120]   was completely reinventing the concept of a computer
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.280]   and a smartphone.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.520]   Ties into this machine learning.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.440]   It was at the very end of the keynote.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.960]   They announced something called Instant Apps.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.720]   And the theory was you don't have to have an app installed.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.240]   And I think it works best with this voice interface.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.080]   But you ask for something.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:03.800]   Let's say the scenario is you say, OK, Google, what
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.880]   are some good Italian restaurants around here?
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.760]   They give you a list.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.880]   You say, OK, make a reservation at Bocellys.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.160]   This is the one they use as an example.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.360]   For two tomorrow at 6 p.m.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.680]   And then it comes back and says, I've loaded a little bit
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.400]   of-- it wouldn't say this, but this would happen.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.160]   I've loaded a little bit of open table enough
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.920]   to see that there's a table for two available at 7 p.m.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.520]   Would you like that table?
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.720]   You say, yes, you never had open table installed.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.000]   But what the phone is going to start to do
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.640]   is start loading enough--
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.080]   of course, developers have to cooperate by modularizing
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.120]   their applications, I think all will--
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.160]   loading enough of an app to run that particular function.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.200]   And then at some point, say, if you'd like the full app,
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.320]   you're downloaded.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.200]   But this is why I think this is an interesting evolution.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.760]   Why that instead of web pages, Leo?
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.200]   Why go to the web for that?
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.880]   Well, if you can do it on the web, fine.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.160]   There's a lot of stuff apps do.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.880]   Let me finish, and then I'd love to hear what you think.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.960]   The idea being, right now, apps are fairly siloed.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.640]   You have to install an app.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.680]   You have to install Trippit to get Trippit functionality.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.640]   You have to install a compass app
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.120]   to get compass functionality, whatever.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.240]   And it's a little silo.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.400]   You launch it.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.360]   It's in there.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.880]   And then you exit out of it, and it does that.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.160]   I love this idea that the phone--
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.000]   and in some ways, these bots, these machine language
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   ais are your representative, your ombudsman.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.920]   They know what you want to do, because you've told them
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.160]   or you didn't get it somehow.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.880]   They go out and get the help they need to get it done.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.960]   You never have to worry about having that app.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.560]   And suddenly what happens is I no longer have apps.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:45.400]   I have a relationship with a bot or with my phone,
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.760]   and then let it do the job.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.600]   To me, that is next generation thinking.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.120]   And I think Apple-- there's nothing
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.120]   that stops Apple from doing this, by the way.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.920]   But I think this is a very interesting way
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:58.760]   to think of these devices and much, much more modern.
[00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.760]   OK, go ahead.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.800]   So there's two things here that I really, really like.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.280]   One is that this feels like that moment when Facebook realized
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.080]   they couldn't just use a web view anymore.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.040]   And they had to go native.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.000]   And when you look at Android apps running on Chrome
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.680]   and you look at app slices basically
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.240]   being downloaded on the fly, I think
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.000]   it shows that while everyone keeps saying web performance
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.880]   is coming, it's always never quite arriving.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.200]   And this, I think, is a great way
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.080]   to sort of get the best of both worlds.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.400]   And it sort of ties into why I loved extensibility
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   when Apple announced that two years ago.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.040]   Because it essentially does to apps what happened to the web.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.640]   We used to go to websites, and then suddenly we had APIs
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.560]   and web services.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.960]   And you can have a website that accesses the Drupal API
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.840]   without-- or an app that accesses it.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.800]   And you're no longer bound to one sort of binary blob.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.360]   And extensibility did that on iOS.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.400]   Now, instead of launching PCALC, I pull down Notification Center.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.240]   And it's there.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.680]   Instead of launching the Pinterest app,
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680]   I just open the Share sheet.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.520]   And it's there.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.920]   Apple has started making moves in those directions, haven't they?
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   And on-demand resources, it downloads slices and assets
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:52.760]   as you need them.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.200]   And to me, I think you're exactly right.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.600]   This is the next generation.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.080]   I do feel-- I don't know how developers are going to react,
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.120]   because they're used to owning real estate.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.040]   Like, this is my brand.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.200]   This is my product.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.920]   And now you might never see it, because it's just--
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.080]   it's totally unbundled features.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.760]   It depends on the developer's sales.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.920]   So if the developer is all about selling an app, you're right.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.040]   And that's why they had a little sopped to developers.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.640]   Oh, and don't worry, we're going to plug your app.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.280]   But for instance, we have a Twitter app.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.360]   But the end game for me is not a Twitter app.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.040]   The end game for me is that you listen to our shows.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.040]   So I don't mind at all if you don't need an app.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.280]   I would love it if the phone would just be intermediates.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.960]   And you could say, as you can, by the way, with the Echo,
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.880]   hey, play Mac break weekly.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.600]   And it would.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.000]   That's how it should be.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.640]   And for this, it's just--
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.520]   a while ago, Ben Evans said, I don't know what an app is
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.720]   going to look like five years from now.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.640]   And I think this shows that he was exactly right.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.520]   Two, three years from now, what does downloading an app
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.680]   on your smartphone mean?
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.120]   Probably something really, really different
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.080]   than we thought it would.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.880]   Jim, what do you think?
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.720]   Well, I have to agree.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.720]   I mean, what we expect from our phones now
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.600]   and what we expect in three years
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.720]   is completely different than what we expected in 2007
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.480]   when the iPhone first came out.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.000]   I mean, we really expect the devices
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.600]   that we have to be very intelligent.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.360]   And I don't think that we expected that five years ago.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.280]   We expected them to respond to our input.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.640]   Now we kind of want them to know what we want
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.120]   and to be a step ahead of us.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.320]   And in a lot of respects, they're getting there.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.800]   Yeah, I think it's a really nice step.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.040]   A lot of us, certainly myself, keep complaining
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   about how the springboard is just such a stagnant piece
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.560]   of software on iOS that it's really antique.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.360]   It's old-fashioned.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.960]   We need something that's a little bit more muscular,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.200]   that's a little bit more useful.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.480]   But it's possible.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.240]   But we really are entering into a phase
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.240]   where the act of explicitly launching an app
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.560]   is going to indicate a failure point in the device.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:58.920]   Wow.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.360]   Where I love the idea.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.480]   The idea that-- yeah, I mean, the idea that I should be spending--
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.960]   I should be spending most of my time now in an app like L.O.,
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.440]   for instance.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.320]   It's a chat.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.400]   It's a messaging app.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.160]   But the idea that I will simply-- here's
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.040]   what I want you to do, Mr. or Mrs. Device.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.320]   And it will just simply fetch the code
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.960]   that it needs from whatever app that's
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.840]   installed to make that happen, including a very, very rich
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.320]   GUI interface to make that happen.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.200]   I will never have to actually install Omni--
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.240]   excuse me-- to actually launch Omni Outliner to just simply
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   send a piece of data or get a piece of data out from that.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.560]   Yeah, now, the Omni group may not
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.200]   be super happy about that.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.840]   Well, no, no, I'll still have to go about.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.800]   They can have a bot.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.000]   Well, what if-- well, what if--
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.960]   of course, I already own it.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.080]   But now I'm using it a lot more.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.040]   And now this is because it's everywhere that I want it to be.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.120]   It's not something that I'm willing to do without, even
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.200]   when they charge $40 as they showed for the next major update.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.000]   Or even-- it's even more interesting when
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.440]   you're talking about content that's on the web, where I don't really--
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.760]   I probably have knocked at least 300 calories a month off
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.720]   of my goal by saying, no, don't download this app.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.200]   Just taping to the web page with the information on it.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.480]   Because I really don't want to have to install Yelp just
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   to find out what a whole bunch of bots have spammed
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.480]   the comments thread on a restaurant, say.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.000]   But if I'm just doing getting a web results on my phone
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.480]   or getting a notification, and Yelp can simply push out,
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.040]   here is a much better view of that restaurant
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.680]   and the data that we have on it.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.000]   Maybe I would press a deeper button
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.280]   after a few minutes of real time.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.840]   I'm actually getting a lot of help from Yelp,
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.120]   as opposed to a web page.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.600]   Maybe it is worth my installing that.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.160]   So you're going-- it's the difference between,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.800]   do you want someone to maybe download your music illegally
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.760]   for a while, but then become such a fan
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.160]   that they are paying $130 for tickets to your concerts?
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.920]   Or do you want them to simply never know you exist
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.120]   and never put any money into your pockets whatsoever?
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.520]   Amazing how this changes over time.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.160]   Previously, it was like, oh, great.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.200]   I have Pee-Cal on my phone.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.920]   And I was like, I can't be bothered to launch it.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.480]   I'm just going to notification center.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.880]   Well, I can get apps on my phone.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.080]   I was like, oh, I got to download an app and install it.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.880]   And then remember, I got to delete it.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.160]   All these things that were miracles,
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.480]   just a few years ago are now tedious chores to watch it.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.600]   I mean, there's a lot of hurdles in this.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.800]   There's the issue of bandwidth and time.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.600]   And right now on the Apple Watch,
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.000]   it takes forever if the app's not on the watch.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.880]   You don't want a situation where you see that spinning icon.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.640]   OK, great.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.920]   Or even I was roaming the other day.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.400]   I didn't have an app downloaded and I needed it.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.960]   And I just couldn't get a ball and I couldn't download it.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.080]   And I'm watching that thing take a way.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.520]   Desperate that my battery doesn't run out before I get that app.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.760]   Hey, didn't Apple say that by June 1st,
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.120]   all apps would have to be native to the watch?
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.440]   Is that not right?
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.160]   I believe so.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.200]   So what have-- a lot of apps updating?
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:52.880]   What's going on?
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.080]   Because that's only about a week away.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.440]   The last update did something.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.520]   Because there's new animations on the Apple launcher
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.560]   and apps launched faster than they did before.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   So it was just a point increase.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.200]   But it seems like there's some kind of stuff going on there.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.040]   And did they imply when we would be
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.000]   getting a new watch OS or have they said it?
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.960]   It should be dubbed up.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.160]   I mean, the watch OS.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.080]   Yeah, watch OS 3, Apple TV OS 10, iOS 10, and all--
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.600]   All June.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.240]   Yeah, again, like OS 10, 10.12, Mac OS 12, Mac OS 11, don't know.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.040]   But interesting.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.640]   Will it be El Capitan or are we going to move to another monument?
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.160]   Another new monument?
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:29.680]   A different one.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.440]   What do you think, Jim?
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.880]   You hear anything?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.520]   Beard.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.480]   Beard, OS 10 Beard, Jim's Beard.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.080]   Apple does have a lot to make up for.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.600]   I would not blame them whatsoever.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.160]   How about Awani?
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.920]   OS 10, oh, no, that's a brand name, right?
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.800]   That's not a year.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.400]   Where is the Heineken main brewery?
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.000]   Which would sound like that.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.080]   The real Opeding.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.760]   It's an Amstel.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.040]   All right, June when?
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:57.360]   When?
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.920]   June 10th, when is WWDC?
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.400]   13th.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.360]   13th.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.280]   When is the big party, more importantly?
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.440]   Big party is the 13th as well.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.520]   So every year for the last--
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.440]   this is the sixth year.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:20.240]   I've put on a free party for developers.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.480]   And it's always called the Beard Bash for obvious reasons.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.600]   So yeah, I named a party after my beard.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   So this year we're doing it with Renee and Imor.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.120]   We have people from all over the world,
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   developers from all over, coming to the party.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.080]   And we're doing two bands this year,
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.640]   a local San Francisco band that plays hard rock,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:58.280]   and a band that's founded by a couple of Apple--
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:05.120]   or not work at Apple, but a couple of developers and designers
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.240]   called Airplane Mode.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.840]   I know, that's exciting.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.880]   Renee's been talking about them for ages.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.440]   Yeah, it's going to be a great party.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.280]   We serve free beer and wine for the night.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.720]   And you need to die.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.640]   Free Heineken and wine.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.960]   Really, do you have a deal with Heinee?
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   No.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.760]   No.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.280]   He just won't let it go to other beers in the building.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.040]   OK.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.320]   It's just one of those.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.880]   I always want to have a night where developers can get just
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.160]   come and listen to good music and have a good time.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.560]   It's a good location.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.280]   It's right there.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.880]   You won't have to walk far.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.080]   Right by the blue bottle there on Jesse Street.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.160]   You can have some coffee to stay up later.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640]   But you got RSVP, right?
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.240]   Well, yeah.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.920]   The RSVP list went out last week.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.520]   It's sold out-- well, sold out.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.640]   The tickets are free.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.280]   Oh, so it's waiting list now.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.800]   Now it's waiting list.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.600]   But yeah, it's sold out in a few hours.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.240]   And it's going to be a great time.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.200]   How many people can you get in the mezzanine there?
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.120]   Well, you can fit 700 or better in there.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:19.960]   And you sold out.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.800]   Wow.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.360]   Yeah, no time.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.480]   That's awesome, Jim.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.400]   Yeah, quicker than what I thought.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.440]   The power of the beard.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.080]   We're really happy about--
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.160]   It's a dub dub institution.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.000]   I mean, Apple grabbed beer bash first.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.200]   So Jim had two options, and they took one of them,
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.600]   so he went with the beard bash.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.680]   And I think that the better part of that deal.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.360]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.280]   So the keynote is that more--
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:44.960]   you were smart.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.720]   You have the party not the night before the keynote,
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.080]   but the night of the keynote.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:49.880]   Of the keynote.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.640]   Yeah, that way it'll be able to get up early.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.560]   Yeah, everybody will be still talking about the keynote.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.120]   And come in, have a drink, and party.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.320]   Wrong code to the bands.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320]   A lot of fun.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.800]   All right, well, it's not too late.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.640]   You just go to loopinsight.com and get on that waiting list
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.280]   and cross your fingers that somebody gets sick and dies.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.120]   Because--
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.800]   I know, that's rude.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:16.800]   Wow.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.560]   That's mean.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.080]   But--
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:18.440]   Great.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   --for the merciful release of death.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.760]   Well, the keynote is actually at the Bill Graham Center this year.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.600]   So it's going to just be the developers who can find their way back.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.120]   Wow.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.360]   And it's not a Moscone.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   It's a Bill Graham.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360]   The conferences at Moscone, but the keynote at the--
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.080]   It's not so far.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.760]   It's all within a few blocks.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.480]   Just watch out for the homeless people on your way to Bill Graham.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.080]   Right.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.240]   keynote at 10 AM.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:38.560]   Yes.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.440]   Live stream.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.080]   I think so.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.600]   Yeah, they've already said live stream.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.760]   So Carson, make a note of that.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.040]   We're going to have to come in-- is that a Tuesday or a Wednesday?
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.560]   And Apple's live streaming these days is really solid.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.800]   They must have done something amazing.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.840]   They fired the people that screwed up last time.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.480]   I mean, the show last year, they broadcast all the sessions
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.320]   from Presidio Live.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.160]   And that was a miraculous piece of business.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.560]   So June 13 is a Monday, as I can tell from my G-Cal.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.400]   So Monday, we will--
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.760]   morning, we will put off a triangulation that day.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.240]   And actually, I think we can run that.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.480]   That's where we'll run the Scott McNeily interview.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.440]   What do you say?
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.480]   We're doing a Scott McNeily interview next week.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.040]   In the early morning hours.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.560]   How early do I have to come in to talk to Scott?
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.800]   What?
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.840]   9 o'clock.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.360]   Leo, we finally have the thin client.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.120]   It's a perfect time to talk to him.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.440]   Just have your bot ask him the question.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.200]   Scott, I have a question for you.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.560]   So yeah, well, that's what we'll do is we'll run that.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.840]   And then we'll do our live coverage with the keynote.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.560]   I am excited.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.200]   I always get excited for these because frankly, I'm almost
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.000]   more interested in a new MacBook than I am in a new iPad.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.480]   We're new--
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.360]   Software?
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:53.840]   Yeah, and software.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.400]   And I love to see what they do with OS X and what
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.560]   the landmark they'll name it after.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.280]   So is there anything more in Yosemite that's like half dome?
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   Half dome?
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.520]   Half dome?
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.360]   That's kind of a bad name for an operating system.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.760]   Or if they shift to half a OS, do they still need a code name?
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.680]   Because they don't have code names for OS X or TV O.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.760]   Maybe they're not doing the name, which is going to be Mac OS.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.640]   I think they will because they started it so recently.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.040]   But it will be interesting to see how they manage that.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.120]   Isn't that though the rumor that they're going to say, hey,
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.680]   by the way now, it's not OS X, it's Mac OS.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.440]   Yep.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.520]   And they just call it Mac--
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.000]   Mac OS 2016.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:30.600]   You know what?
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.440]   This is the year.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:32.920]   This is it.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.320]   They're going to say Mac OS 2016.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.560]   That's it.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.120]   It's actually funny because originally they
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.720]   had these code names named after big cats that were internal names.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.120]   And marketing goes, those are great.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.280]   Let's use those in the product.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.400]   And they're like, oh, now we've got to think of new code names.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:44.760]   Great.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.080]   Thanks.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:45.720]   We'll get new wines.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.880]   Oh, we ran out of wines.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.920]   Let's use apples.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.160]   And then it's like, oh, we're going to use landmarks publicly.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.760]   And it just becomes so confusing when iOS 9 is so simple.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.880]   But what do you make of--
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.400]   Wallpaper, if it's just called Mac OS 2016,
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.760]   what's the wallpaper look like?
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.520]   Beard calendar.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.000]   Beard.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.720]   Apple's going to give-- introduce a new wallpaper.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.360]   And they think it's the best wallpaper they've ever shipped.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.720]   We've prepared a video.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   Half Dome is too much like somebody in the chat room
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.360]   said it's too much like half done.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.440]   So I think probably that will not.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.160]   I think I'm going to go out on a limb here and say,
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.960]   put that on your bingo card for WWC keynote.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.120]   It's going to be Mac OS 2016.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:23.720]   Why not?
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.520]   Well, at least they can't do worse than what Google did
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.600]   by saying that we know that you're
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.840]   used to us naming the--
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.200]   it's to Android N. We know you're
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.880]   used to us naming it after a candy or a dessert.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   But we haven't decided what it's going to be yet.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   So just send us suggestions.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.600]   Who cares?
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.080]   Just like say--
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.880]   You can vote in the American Idol app right now.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.240]   I'll say anything.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.240]   All right, I'm going to tell you why I got naked on Sunday
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:47.960]   in just a second.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.720]   But first, a word from our sponsor, Andy Naco,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.600]   is here from the Chicago Sun Times, Jim Dalrymple.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.840]   Loop Insight.com.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.160]   That's where you can go, by the way,
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.120]   get on the waiting list for the Beard Bash.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   And Renee Ritchie from iMore.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.880]   Take off our shirts now, Leo, or do we wait?
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.760]   Hold on a second.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.920]   Get your foliage ready.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.440]   OK.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:11.120]   Are you going to be brought to you by Rocket Mortgage?

[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.160]   It's a bad time.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.440]   Have you bought a house of refinance lately?
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:18.960]   It is.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.240]   We bought our house a couple of years ago.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.280]   The paperwork was insane.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.960]   And we were on a cruise.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:26.560]   It took so long.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.080]   We were running up and on a cruise.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.680]   We were faxing, hand signing and faxing documents.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.040]   This is in the 21st century, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.440]   to our mortgage broker.

[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.880]   If you're going to go out and start looking for a house,
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.680]   get pre-qualified at Rocket Mortgage right now.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.480]   Because that makes you a much more--
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.920]   in this marketplace, I don't know
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.000]   what's like in the rest of the country.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.520]   But here in California, if you're not pre-qualified,
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.800]   you don't even have a chance of getting that house.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.440]   It's really a seller's market.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.120]   Quickandlones.com/macbreak, equal housing lender
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.880]   licensed in all 50 states.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.160]   Sorry, Renee.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.360]   NMLS consumeraccess.org, number 3030.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.680]   Go to quickandlones.com/macbreak.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.600]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.760]   Mac, break, weekly.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.680]   Every time I say Rocket Mortgage, I want to go.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.680]   [WOOF]
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   [WOOF]
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.680]   [WOOF]
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.680]   [WOOF]
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.880]   Uh, OK.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.240]   Has anybody-- did Renee when you were in town
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.160]   like last week, right?
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.280]   Yeah, Jim and I hit up the preview event on Thursday.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:25.840]   So you did.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.080]   You both went to the new Apple Store in San Francisco.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.120]   Yes.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.640]   Instead of a genius bar, it is a genius grove.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.840]   It's calming and soothing and zen.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.960]   And there's no elbowing.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.000]   It almost feels like they don't want to sell products.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   They just want you to just kind of hang out.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.880]   The most insightful comment, Angela Arons came up
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.440]   and she spoke.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.600]   I know you got to see her.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.240]   And Johnny, I'm so jealous.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:50.960]   So cool.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   I'll get to that.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.200]   What she said was, because there's always,
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.800]   why doesn't Apple have Angela Arons talking
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.360]   at all their events?
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.200]   Oh, they're evil.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.520]   But she says, like, I really don't--
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.560]   it's like Johnny, I really don't like this talking thing.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.880]   But I'm super passionate about this.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.840]   Pass me some water.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.160]   I'm going to try to get through this.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.600]   And then she said, you know, the online
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.000]   has taken over so much people can get
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:06.960]   built to order options.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.280]   They're shipped right to them.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.240]   They can get help from Apple support on Twitter.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.600]   So they had to redefine why people would go to an Apple store.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.800]   And they realized it's not for like little how-tos
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.200]   or small software fixes, but it's
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.040]   to get actual help with hardware.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.520]   And they want you to be able to sit down
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.480]   and not be elbowed off the side of a bar or have to stand there
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.080]   and just work with the genius, not be across from them.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.600]   Right.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.440]   So they redesigned it so they would have a whole different--
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.680]   much more hardware focus than it previously did.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.080]   So the front door-- this is, by the way, just off Union Square.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.520]   It's where the old Nike store was next to the Hyatt.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.360]   The front door is 24-foot tall--
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.520]   Pains it.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.120]   Sorry?
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:43.680]   42-foot tall.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.280]   42.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.000]   I got it dyslexic.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.920]   42-foot tall glass panels that slide back
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.880]   so that you can be kind of inside and outside.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.280]   Drive right in.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.200]   [LAUGHS]
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.840]   They have five departments, not just the genius grove.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.000]   And you think I'm making that up?
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.400]   That's actually what they call it.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.120]   The genius grove, the avenue, the forum,
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.840]   the plaza and the boardroom.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.920]   Oh, my.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.720]   Oh, my.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.360]   Photo-voltaic sells on the building's roof,
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.680]   so it's 100% renewable energy.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.920]   There are apparently people in kilts.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.280]   Well, they have a new position there called the Creative Pro.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.160]   So what they did is with the accessories,
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.720]   they divided them up into four sections.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.400]   So you have photography, music, creativity, and apps.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.800]   And they want you to actually pick the stuff up and try it.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.040]   And if it's your first time there
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.080]   and you don't know how music works with your devices
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080]   or you don't know much about photography,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.320]   they'll show you all the basics you need to get started.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.640]   But they'll also start doing things like Final Cut Pro
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.160]   and Logic Pro.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.200]   I think the number they gave is they're
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.800]   going to devote 20% of all this real estate just
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.120]   for educational programs and educational outreach,
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.440]   starting from school level all the way up to pro level.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.320]   If Alex Lindsey were here, he would say,
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:01.720]   this is what I predicted, is that stores
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.520]   are going to go away as we do more and more shopping
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.760]   online, the idea of a store.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.840]   It's just as you said, has to be reinvented.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.320]   And it's not going to be somewhere you go to shop,
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.880]   more somewhere you go to have an experience of the brand.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.760]   And get human interaction.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.480]   And so this picture is the genius grove.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.560]   It's not exactly a grove.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.240]   They got a few potted plants.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.560]   But I do like the idea that instead of the genius
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.080]   being on the other side of the table,
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.120]   kind of lording it over you, because they are,
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.000]   at least in San Francisco, they were on a raised platform
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:32.840]   looking down.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.720]   They didn't take a backup for Italy.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.520]   They're next to you.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.200]   So you can elbow them if they say something snarky.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   Oh, and tons of Macraig fans, staff and people
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.600]   they were like during the event.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.960]   Oh, they probably didn't appreciate my snark
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.120]   about the news store.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.680]   I thought it was like an herbal essence commercial.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.400]   That's why I had to strip down.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.800]   Wow.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.480]   Jim and I stay closed throughout.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:56.880]   I'm going to test that.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   I haven't been there yet.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.480]   And actually, as I look at these pictures,
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.320]   it does look more like just a regular store.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.800]   But with some nice-- you know, San Francisco weather
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.440]   isn't that good all the time.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.000]   So those doors may be closed more than half the year.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.800]   And what it's meant to be like the focus is community
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.280]   for this.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.400]   And what they wanted to be able to do
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.720]   was to open it up so they could have almost like block
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:17.080]   parties.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.800]   And the store could become part of that square,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.520]   and not just be a sealed off chamber on top of it.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520]   Right.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.760]   I was a little concerned that it felt almost cult-like.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.760]   It clearly designed as a Johnny Ive project.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:35.000]   It's like an aluminum cube with glass sides.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.520]   And embedded Apple logo.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.960]   Yeah, it's like one of us.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.760]   Doesn't glow anymore.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.240]   It's like a MacBook and it's base gray.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.960]   The Church of Scientology would be happy to have this
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.080]   as their global headquarters.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.520]   Gosh, I can't see Leo.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.960]   I saw the top of his head emerging out of the whole universe.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.160]   I crapped yourself, but now I don't see him at all.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.400]   Yeah, it wasn't that vibe though.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.560]   I mean, like the Apple is--
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.360]   Apple's always been like Steve Dallows famously said,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.640]   I don't want to see Apple logos everywhere,
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.120]   because it devalues the logo.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.160]   And it's very much like that.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.400]   And so it's not overwhelmingly--
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.360]   it's overwhelmingly creative.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.880]   They have people-- there's a giant 60--
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.000]   sorry, 6K display.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.480]   And I couldn't see lines on it.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:14.440]   It was pretty impressive.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.360]   And they have images going by there.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.600]   And people play music.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.440]   And it really feels like an arts center more than it does,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.600]   like an Apple cult headquarters.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.680]   I guess that's what bothers me.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.280]   And it's because I'm an old school kind of guy.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.760]   And I think, no, Apple's a computer company.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.640]   Let's see--
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.440]   Let's just sell--
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.520]   I can all play fries.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.120]   Radio Shaft.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.280]   It's not a lifestyle.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.680]   It's a freaking computer company.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.200]   Well, in the park-- oh, back--
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.600]   where they have a little park that they build,
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.000]   they're going to have little concerts, acoustic things
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   back there, Wi-Fi enabled.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.120]   People can go there and meet and sit.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   I'm just jealous.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.360]   I mean, look at-- I'm just a podcast.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.000]   What did I build?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.480]   A crazy thing, right?
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   A podcast is important to them.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.560]   We're going to show those off too.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.120]   Are they?
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.520]   Oh, I love the new Apple store.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.000]   I love it.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.600]   Back cuddle, back cuddle, back cuddle.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.720]   They have that area to bring people in.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.480]   They're going to bring in experts and podcasters
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.520]   and developers and all those.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.440]   And they have that plaza there so that you can sit on those little
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.920]   box and round chairs.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.600]   And they can have small groups or large groups
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.920]   and they can go through how to get started with podcasting,
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.000]   what podcasts are great.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.720]   There's going to be a lot of, again, 20% education stuff,
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.680]   which is pretty cool.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.480]   And I don't think anybody with a giant sledgehammer
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.960]   will come running down the aisle and throw it
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.160]   at that giant screen.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.440]   I certainly hope not.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.720]   Jim just wanted the hockey game on.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.160]   It's the hockey game.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.480]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.840]   You got to say that it's in Union Square.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.080]   So this is one of the most expensive retail areas
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.280]   in one of the most expensive cities.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.360]   Oh, around the corner is Tiffany,
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.520]   Sacsville Avenue.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:49.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:54.600]   But Tiffany and Sacs are not inviting you to just walk in
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:59.080]   and use their Wi-Fi and sit under a tree and maybe attend
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:22:59.680]   like a public health.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.640]   That was my other thought, was doesn't Apple
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.400]   know about the homeless problem in San Francisco?
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.320]   They have the best security of any Apple's forever.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.240]   Count down to the first really, really ugly video of someone
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:14.320]   saying, yeah, we're not going to let you pitch a tent in here.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:14.840]   Sorry.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.920]   But it's the grove.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.320]   Oh my god, hammocks.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   I didn't even think about that.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.640]   People are going to come in with hammocks.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.120]   No one would deny, though, that this is really Apple saying,
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.480]   we are a lifestyle brand.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.640]   Well, they get to do what they like to do.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.320]   And there's anybody who's been to even an Apple store in a mall
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.280]   knows that it is crowded.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.520]   It starts to become an unpleasant experience.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.360]   You start to thread the fact that you know that you're--
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.520]   I'm having problems thinking something to my phone
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.840]   or I don't understand this work.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.720]   But the last thing I would want to do is go to an Apple store.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.080]   So not only does it allow them to express their love of design,
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.320]   but also to solve the problem of saying,
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.240]   to flip that around and say that when they get to build
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.840]   these flagship stores to say that I actually
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.960]   want to go to the Apple store.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.160]   There's so many times where I'm in another different city
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.960]   and there's some stuff I need to get done.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.560]   I'll say, where's the nearest Apple store?
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.440]   That's going to be an OK place to hang out for an hour
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.240]   while I use the Wi-Fi and get things done.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.360]   I know they're not going to hassle me.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.680]   And if there's a Chipotle nearby, all the better.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.040]   Really still eating at Chipotle?
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.600]   They've got a certain amount of faith.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   I've never had a problem with Chipotle.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.880]   Given that they see-- given that there's a lot less--
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.680]   there isn't as many crowds there now.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.440]   Yeah, the lines are shorter.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.520]   It's still like if I want to spend $7 and get what
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.960]   I recognize as real good food that tastes good,
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.120]   that I can have served in less than five minutes,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.520]   is Chipotle still handling it?
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:57.000]   I noted that Chipotle is buying ads on NPR podcasts.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.360]   And I thought, Chipotle, you're talking the wrong people.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.800]   Those are not people going to Chipotle.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.440]   You need to buy ads on Twitter.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.760]   That's people going to Chipotle, Maverick.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.480]   This is who eats at Chipotle, not those NPR hoity toities.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.200]   The other thing that was super fascinating at this
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.720]   was you did have Angel Anzer.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.880]   You did have Johnny I over there.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.000]   And they could have very easily said, OK,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.160]   this year the Genius Bar is going to have a slight angle.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.400]   Or this year the theater is going to have plush seating.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.840]   And Johnny I was pretty--
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.000]   Angel I haven't spoken about this.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.920]   She did some remarks.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.840]   But Johnny was pretty cool about this, too.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.800]   And it's like they didn't want to just incrementally
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.160]   improve it.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.560]   They wanted to do that thing where they say, what
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.600]   is the essence of this?
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.960]   And it has a theater now, not because it used to,
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.600]   but because it makes sense given their community approach.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.320]   It no longer has a Genius Bar.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.520]   It now has a Genius Grove because the bar no longer
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.040]   made sense given that one guiding principle they wanted.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.800]   And then they very specifically built out from that.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.840]   I think that's actually fair.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.200]   This is also-- did you get to talk to Johnny
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.920]   or were you just standing there in awe
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.120]   while he opened a bottle of water?
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.440]   Because I saw the picture.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.840]   Yeah, no, I got to talk to him very briefly.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.480]   It's the second time I've had to talk to him.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.120]   And both times he sounds exactly like he does on the video.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.280]   Every time I've spoken to an Apple executive,
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.120]   you think that they're up there performing.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.280]   But they speak.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.360]   And he's always been sort of like, yes, I made a product.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.840]   But that's my guess.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.560]   I need to see how people interact with it
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.280]   before I can understand what it really is.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.000]   And then I iterate based on that.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.280]   And from a designer of his--
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.240]   he's won more Hansel Awards than I think most companies put
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:24.960]   together.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.080]   And he's still incredibly humble about what the reaction can
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.200]   be and what his real job is going forward.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.360]   He does seem like a very humble guy.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.000]   I have to say, that comes across.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.640]   Really does.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.000]   It was 2001 Steve Jobs introduced the first Apple store.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.080]   I apologize for the quality of the video.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.800]   This is our store.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.880]   And the store is divided in the four parts.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.080]   John and Yoko in the deck.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.120]   The store has our home section with great home and education
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.080]   products, and a pro section with all our great pro products.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.280]   And every product we have--
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.680]   You never see Apple making up plastic computers.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.120]   It's the first 25% of the store.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.040]   You can see the whole product line.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.880]   And as you see up on the ceiling,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.920]   we've even labeled the sections--
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.240]   home, music, kids, genius on this side--
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.400]   and pro--
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.040]   Was this the store that they had originally
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.480]   that then Ron Johnson-- what was his name?
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.160]   Ron?
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:20.840]   Yeah, Ron Johnson.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.560]   Ron Johnson said, Steve, we've got to do it all over again.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.480]   Or is this the-- we did it all over again.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.800]   I think this must be that we did it all over again version.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   It looks pretty much like the current Apple store, right?
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.160]   25% shows you our entire product line.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.000]   Now, there's 36 computers on display in the store.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.560]   Every single one of them is connected to the internet.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.360]   So you can go up to any computer and start surfing.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.000]   If you watch this, you realize that what they're doing even
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.640]   today is absolutely--
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:50.960]   This is the antecedent of that.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.960]   We'll be here for wireless networking
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.920]   so you can experience that for yourself.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.840]   It's pretty great.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.880]   So come on over here.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.480]   Let me show you what we've got going in the home section.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.840]   I don't remember Steve--
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.680]   I don't remember Steve doing this.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   I don't remember Steve doing this.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   I don't remember Steve doing this.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]   I don't remember Steve doing this.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   Most of the products are running self-running demos,
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.360]   but you can just walk up to them
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.560]   and start using them for anything you like.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.920]   And here we've got three iBooks on display,
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.840]   and we've got every single model of iMac we make as well.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.600]   We've got our new PowerBook G4 Titaniums running here.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.680]   Again, all running Mac OS X, all on airports.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   So you can just pick these up.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.240]   Remember, one of the goals of this
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.400]   is just to get a store where people can actually
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.000]   see a running Mac.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.320]   Because they were in CompUSA.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.720]   They were like the ghetto in CompUSA.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.560]   And the salespeople weren't getting
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:36.840]   spips on sales, and so they didn't want to--
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.520]   Yeah, whatever.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.720]   You want to buy a Mac?
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.240]   OK.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.400]   We've got a wireless connection to the internet.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.720]   And we've got every PowerMac we make here,
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.400]   along with all of our great displays,
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.000]   including the 22-inch cinema display.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.320]   And I have to say, I thought this was crazy when Apple did it,
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.640]   because Gateway had just closed their stores.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.840]   They were such a flop trying to do this kind of a similar idea,
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.680]   which is, well, you should see them in touch and before you
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.440]   buy them.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.360]   And I thought, boy, Apple is really
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360]   taking a chance going into retail here.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.480]   Another business they don't understand.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.720]   I said the same thing about the iPhone when they got into that,
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.280]   saying the same thing about services,
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.120]   and out there in that.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.920]   They somehow manage cars.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.840]   We're saying the same thing about cars.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.000]   Yeah, machine learning.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.520]   They somehow manage to find their way and reinvent it
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.920]   and reinvent it.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.560]   We come back seven years later and find out
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.440]   Apple's gotten so much smarter in such a short period of time.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.280]   And incidentally, from day one, retail was a massive success.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.360]   And a big-- I mean, they did need to do it.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.160]   That really was the problem, is that people weren't
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.840]   getting the best Apple experience.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.760]   Jim, how's Apple Music treating you these days?
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.120]   Did two men come to your home?
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.640]   Two men did not.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:54.760]   But back into Apple Music is actually getting a whole lot better.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.600]   When you saw James Pinkstone's article in "Vellum,"
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.880]   he complained about something very similar to what happened to you.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.360]   Did you say, yes, see?
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.360]   No, because his problem was different than mine.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:14.200]   You know, his was a bug with iTunes.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.920]   I believe that's what they found out,
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.520]   where it actually did delete physical copies.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.080]   It actually did do that, you think?
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.440]   Was it user error?
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.760]   That's what it appears.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.120]   I mean, they did send people out to his house.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.640]   So there have been a lot of issues with Apple Music
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.240]   over the past year.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.760]   And there's been a lot of improvements in Apple Music
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.440]   over the past year.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.560]   If you look at the way that the back end of the service
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.120]   works now, it's 100 times better than what it was.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.720]   And that's good.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.800]   Because of the way that the service is set up,
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:55.920]   Apple can do a lot of improvements
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   without ever touching the app, without ever touching iTunes.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:05.320]   iTunes is just the front end for what you see Apple Music doing.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.240]   So if you're looking at a radio station,
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:12.680]   or if you're playing a curated list,
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.280]   all of that stuff is updated in the background.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.400]   So they're constantly updating things.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.280]   So I've been happy with the way that the back end works.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.440]   iTunes match and that whole matching thing.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.120]   They still haven't figured that out.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.960]   Hopefully that's coming soon.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.680]   Because if they nail that, then a lot of the problems
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.480]   that people have been having, I think, will go away.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.200]   They did kind of acknowledge that while we can't find this bug,
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.920]   we're worried about it.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:47.320]   And they did release a new version of iTunes.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320]   Right.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:55.840]   Renee, was it just new dialogue boxes?
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.080]   Yeah, I mean, like the sidebar.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.680]   Oh, they put the sidebar back.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.320]   Well, we knew that.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.960]   They're doing some interesting contextual stuff.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.360]   But this is this the reinvention that we were talking about for WWC?
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.320]   No, no.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.480]   OK.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.200]   No.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:08.920]   There's going to be more.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.520]   There's more to come in June.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.600]   Well, if your timelines are hard, if you believe what you've read,
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.280]   then, yeah, there should be more coming in June.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.080]   And I welcome any improvement to it.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.400]   Well, Jim, just sitting at the table will offering you a seat.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.840]   Next, Dan, if you're better.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:31.920]   All right.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.160]   So as far as I could tell, I mean, I looked at when the new one came out,
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.720]   we opened it and I looked at it.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.920]   And the dialogue boxes seem no less confusing.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.440]   So I don't know what they--
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.520]   It's so like--
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.640]   I still maintain they've got to become really opinionated
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.840]   about what they want iTunes to be.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:49.280]   Because they cannot continue to cater to everybody
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.800]   and have a same product.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.320]   It's the kitchen drawer.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.320]   It's not for anything.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.640]   It's just where people get things get put because you know
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.880]   you need to have them nearby, but you don't know how to organize it.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   Are they actually redesigning from scratches everybody's saying they
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:05.320]   should do, or is this just going to be more band-aids?
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.120]   I mean, again, it's billions of dollars of transactions.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.160]   It's people sinking their--
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.240]   It's just bought nanos on Windows.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.480]   It is an airplane being rebuilt while they are flying it.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:13.960]   Right.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.360]   They're definitely considering everything.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:21.760]   And that's the important thing to remember here is that Apple having
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.200]   everything in this one app does make sense because it processes billions of dollars.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.200]   Right.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.120]   You know, they're very good at processing billions of dollars.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.120]   And they don't want to lose that.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.600]   They can't screw that part of it up.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.320]   So they screw the other part up instead.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.600]   You know, but we'll see.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.480]   We'll see how it goes at WDC.
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:52.440]   According to a new study, Fitbits are highly inaccurate.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.200]   This is, I guess, good news for Apple and Apple Watch owners.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:01.640]   Although I've been wearing the Fitbit Blaze for some time and I've compared it
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:06.600]   to the Apple Watch and to other heart rate monitors and found it to be fairly accurate.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:13.840]   This study says this was a study done with, you know, like real at Cal State
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:20.640]   Poly and in Pomona with real surge watches, not the Blaze, but the surge watches and the
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.920]   charge heart rate bands.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.040]   And then they hooked people up to like this bio harness and got an ECG out of it.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.560]   And they said that the Fitbit device is miscastulated heart rates, but up to 20 beats per minute
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560]   on average, which is significant.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.560]   Wow.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.360]   And that's during more intensive workouts.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:45.040]   And that was one of the claims of, I think a lawsuit against Fitbit was that at higher
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:49.720]   heart rates, it was wildly inaccurate.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.400]   Lower heart rate's not so bad.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:35:01.400]   You know, got to point out the study was sponsored by the law firm that is suing Fitbit.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.800]   So I don't know.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.680]   I have to just say that this has become my fitness divisive choice.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.720]   It doesn't do all the things that the Apple Watch does.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.560]   I don't find that particularly big problems, certainly not as beautiful as the Apple Watch,
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:17.600]   but it does record my heart rate well and my exercise well and my steps well.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.960]   And I haven't noticed that much of a difference.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.600]   So you're going to see that report.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.080]   There's nobody questioning that Apple Watch does a very good job with heart rate.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.640]   Although, you know, this is going to be an interesting battlefield because Fitbit says
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.680]   they're going to add NFC payments.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.680]   Next.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.360]   To the Fitbit watches.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.160]   Pebble also announced, speaking of the competition, two new watches and a pocket computer for
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.120]   runners, Pebble's got to be struggling a little bit with the success of the Apple Watch.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.000]   Apple Watch really owns this market.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.840]   Fitbit's the number one seller of fitness devices.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.400]   So Apple, I don't know if Apple's a runner up or if it's just a different category.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.600]   Pebble has been struggling.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.840]   They were really the company that created this category with their massive Kickstarter
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.000]   launch, but they have yet, I think they have a little trouble finding their niche.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.280]   I think there is yet to be consensus on what consumers actually want from a wearable.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.600]   And so it's every with every year, I think that all these companies going to be learning
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.320]   a little bit more about what people want.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.900]   So if the Apple Watch is not 100% there, I think that's going to get there in three
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:31.640]   years, even if Apple decides that actually we should be making something closer to a
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.800]   Fitbit or even if they want to make something that's a little bit more active like it.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.800]   Like an Android Wear watch.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.280]   But nobody has the right model right yet.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.640]   I think the only people who are doing a really good job are the people who are making $100
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:51.040]   simple bands that do nothing but track and pass notifications because it's last the week.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.480]   They don't have to, people don't have to change their lifestyle by switching a watch
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.960]   they like or wearing a watch.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.920]   And it gives them the basic features that give the most immediate impact.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:07.960]   And I guess we probably should.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.320]   I've been so reluctant to talk about these iPhone 7 rumors, but we are getting closer
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:15.800]   now and it's possible that the iPhone 7's are being made.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.200]   The supply chain would start to be gearing up around now.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.920]   Making your iPhone Leo, they're making another iPhone.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.400]   We know there's another iPhone.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.080]   The question is what will it have?
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   And according to.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.080]   I was green.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.080]   I'm so bored.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.520]   Right. 95.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:33.520]   Oh man.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   All right.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.520]   Okay.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.520]   Now I'm just asking you about these features.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.000]   Are you going to show up behind them?
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   LG.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.240]   Will it be an LG dual camera?
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240]   Not a Sony chip.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.240]   I don't know.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.640]   OIS in the 4.7 inch models.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.600]   I don't know.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.200]   No smart connector, but that's not much of a surprise.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.680]   That's obviously an iPad feature.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   Not a iPhone.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.840]   And they make a tiny keyboard.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.720]   I mean, come on.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.240]   Why are you guys mocking this?
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.120]   Is it silly to talk about it at this point or?
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.120]   No, I love this.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.080]   I think this is exciting part because once Apple actually announces that all our imaginations
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.960]   are worthless, we'll have an actual product.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   So let's just wait.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.400]   Now we have some of all our dreams and potential disappointments.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.900]   It's amazing.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.900]   For speakers.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.360]   Do you care for speakers with this shadowy?
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.000]   I really want that.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.200]   So the iPad, the original iPad had a mono speaker and then the first iPad mini had stereo
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.640]   speakers, but they were at the bottom, which meant that if you held it in any of the other
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.320]   three directions, it was either really weird or your hand was covering them and now the
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.600]   iPad pros have those four speakers.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.800]   It's still stereo, but they do a really good job of mixing things together, even while
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.840]   you're turning it so you get much better, much louder sound.
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.560]   My iPhone, if I still hold it wrong, I can't listen to this show.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.960]   So having more than one speaker there would be a dream come true for me.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960]   Small dreams.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.600]   They'd be the same kind as is on the iPad Pro that you rotated.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.280]   You only hear two at a time though, right?
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.280]   Or do you?
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.280]   I fit those giant echo tamer.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.360]   My space is a premium on the iPhone.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:03.800]   And apparently, serial leaker Stephen Hemerschthofer threw a curveball into the rumor mill.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.880]   I don't know what happens when you throw a curveball into a rumor mill, but he had some
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.920]   leaks from an Italian case maker that has the, you see the four speakers.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.360]   Metallic purple.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   I know.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.800]   I got this is the worst kind of rumors.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.400]   Like, well, a case maker made four speakers.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:26.720]   Do you realize how little money it costs to cool up for just if you want to do a production
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:31.800]   sample just to show buyers that you are in the game and you'll have something to ship,
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.440]   it costs next to nothing compared to what your operating costs are.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.920]   So that means nothing.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:38.920]   Okay.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920]   All right.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920]   You notice I left this to the very end of the show.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.520]   It's like, I don't want to talk about it, but rumors are only are only fun because they
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.480]   allow us to sit to to emphasize.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.280]   Well, well, not fantasize, but saying that if if Apple puts anything but the keyboard
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.080]   that I like in the next MacBook, it will be a total failure.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.120]   It allows you to express what you think are important, what you're hoping for and what
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.360]   would would disappoint you.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.640]   Will we be getting Siri on the Mac with the next with the Mac OS 2016?
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.640]   Just for accessibility.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.640]   I mean, it would be huge.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.760]   There's so many people who just don't have a voice assistant on the Mac and they've gotten
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.920]   so used to it.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.960]   When Apple, it wasn't it wasn't a public thing.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.280]   Tim Cook built this little virtual accessibility house inside Infinite Loop just so Apple could
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.760]   learn about the technology.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.320]   Everyone at Apple because there's tens of thousands of people.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320]   What do you do?
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320]   You put on a blindfold when you go in?
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   How does that work?
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.040]   No, but they like they again, it wasn't it wasn't meant for outsiders.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.040]   So like the details of it.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.040]   We don't know.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.480]   But for example, you could go there and they would give you a demo of how a cochlear implant
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.360]   works or show you how someone is blind would scan money to find out what the money was
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.840]   for or how they would control lights or heating or make sure they don't burn themselves
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.840]   on a stove.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.840]   That's fantastic.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.840]   That's really great.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.840]   Yep.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:50.280]   And it educates the entire company and that technology that assistive technology means
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.440]   Siri plays a huge role in that.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   And right now it's literally not accessible to anybody up on to anybody who's running
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.520]   OS 10 and just to have a version of it there so they could say, Hey, slow mo or yo Siri,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.080]   please do this, this and this and the Mac will dutifully go and do it for them is a hugely
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.640]   enabling feature.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   Yep.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   Yep.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.400]   It's also serves as a reminder that just because Apple has not shipped a product that has
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.640]   what's obviously artificial intelligence or machine learning or just because there has
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.320]   not been an executive or an engineer at the keynote talking about machine learning does
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.840]   not mean that they haven't spent hundreds of millions of dollars with a division inside
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   the company that's doing exactly this sort of stuff.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:33.000]   They do so many they do so many things that aren't even simply exploratory but because
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.080]   they know they're going to need that resource on an ongoing basis and they're pretty much
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.080]   tooled up and ready to go for whenever they they had a new direction.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.640]   And also no company I think no major company I think is as focused on accessibility as
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   Apple is.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.840]   And they might have been like Siri does have tremendous machine learning is not the same
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.840]   way Google does it.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.920]   There's tremendous machine learning involved in Siri understanding all like doing the sequential
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.840]   offerings in all these different languages in all these different regions.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.640]   I mean understanding Scottish alone must be you know, billions of dollars of transaction.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.000]   Because we still don't.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.840]   The Scottish accent is one of my favorites in the world.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.840]   I love the story.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.840]   Is that your Siri?
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.240]   You use the Scottish Siri.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.760]   I just I absolutely love it.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.760]   I love to.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.920]   Is it a man or a woman?
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.920]   Mine?
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.560]   They don't have they have British and Australia right now.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.720]   They have the UK one which I've used.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.760]   We can't get a Scottish Siri.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.400]   I want a Scottish one.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   Oh, I tell you what the weather is like but all you need to know is it's crap.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.400]   Just answers every weather crap.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.680]   Siri, can you find me if it's not scorched?
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.680]   It's crap.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.680]   It's crap.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.680]   It's damn.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.120]   You're not going to drink that tea.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.120]   It's huge.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.720]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.440]   Our apologies to everybody.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440]   Yes.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.680]   Sometimes I'm pleased on hundreds.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.080]   All our hebridean friends.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.360]   We apologize.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.360]   Final story.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360]   They did it again.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.120]   I love these guys at Monument Valley.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.880]   The one US two games.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:09.280]   They last year they did this and they've done it again released all the numbers.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.920]   They've been very transparent about how their app which is a best selling app on the iOS
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.080]   store and is a wonderful app and you should play it.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.520]   They point out that what started as a small things from our perspective quickly blew up
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.320]   into parts of industry discussing our data.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.480]   Apparently it's not common to be so open.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.560]   Somehow the unit of measurement MV has become commonplace.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.800]   If we can only make 10% of an MV, a Monument Valley we can break even.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.280]   All time official downloads.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.480]   Now this is over two years.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.040]   26 million, 102,459.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:56.440]   They made 14.378 million dollars, 73% of that revenue from of course iOS.
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.160]   Only 17% from Google Play.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:02.280]   1% from Windows.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.640]   Their second highest one day revenue was March 1st.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:15.040]   Two days after it was shown on House of Cards shows you House of Cards has some value 69,484
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.240]   dollars in that one day.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:21.080]   50 million unique devices.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.480]   Kind of interesting stuff.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.280]   These graphs are fascinating.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.440]   You can see where the spikes come from.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.240]   Anybody's let's play video.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:35.240]   Being free on iOS.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.360]   Biggest spike actually.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.040]   Christmas in the House of Cards.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.040]   Actually House of Cards is easily the biggest spike.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:51.520]   And then 99 cent week on iOS which dwarfs 99 cent week on Google Play and Christmas.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.520]   I love this.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.520]   Thank you.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.920]   I think transparency is fabulous.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.600]   How many times played by one fictional US president?
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.520]   Two by human beings created by team members.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.680]   13 featured in 13 museums gallery and art festivals.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.520]   19 countries visited 500 fan creations.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.040]   How much do they spend on statisticians?
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.040]   Is that a no?
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:18.800]   50,000 new Twitter followers in the second year.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.080]   28,000 in merch sales.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.000]   That tells you something about merch.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.160]   I know a little bit about that.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:26.560]   You don't get rich on merchandise.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.200]   They've raised $750,000 for charity since the launch.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.200]   Is he George Lucas?
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.480]   The times we've been asked to make more.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.200]   Yeah, he's doing all right in merch today.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.680]   But there are few.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.120]   Clayton's Chewbacca mask another time.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.120]   Can you believe that?
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.120]   Wow.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.120]   Wow.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.800]   Times we've been asked to make more levels.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:44.800]   Infinity.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.800]   Infinity.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.000]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000]   That's pretty good.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   I'm glad they released these.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   Valley numbers for year two.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.240]   There's a nice little medium post on there.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.360]   We're going to take a break.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.920]   Come back in a moment and give you just a chance to make some picks or tips or anything
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.120]   you'd like to leave our audience with.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:08.400]   But before we do that, I'd like to take something away from our audience.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.120]   They're scratchy hairy beards.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.840]   I got a better way to shave.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:13.840]   Well, not you, Jim.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:14.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.720]   Oh, but I'll tell you, I have a Harry's kit.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.400]   And you don't use it?
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.400]   I know on the sides.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.400]   Oh, you have to.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.400]   You have to clean up there.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:26.400]   Harry's.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.560]   Even people who have beards have to groom a little.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.560]   I love Harry's.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.040]   We all love Harry's.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.440]   Harry's makes high quality, high performance blades.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.680]   You sound directly from their factory in Germany.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.680]   And they feel great.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.760]   But the best part is they cost so much less than those drugstore blades.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.800]   And they come to your door on schedule.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.760]   So you never have to shave an extra day with a dull blade.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:55.160]   You always have a nice, sharp, brand new blade available.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.720]   And there are no more lines at the drugstore feeling like a criminal as they unlock the
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.000]   plexiglass pain to get at the razor blades.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.400]   A million guys now have made the shift to Harry's.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.320]   I think we can take credit for a few hundred of those.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.760]   Why don't you go to harry's.com.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   Check it out.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.800]   I use, I'm a fan of the Winston set.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.000]   I have that copper winter Winston from last year.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000]   And they do special models in the silver handle.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.920]   But a lot of people, including by the way, Steve Gibson and others, prefer the Truman
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.960]   set because they like the soft touch plastic handle.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.960]   All the blades are the same.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.800]   It's really just a question of which handle you want.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.240]   The nice thing about the Truman set is you can go get the Truman kit, get yourself started
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.240]   with Harry's for 15 bucks.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:41.440]   That includes the handle, three blades that traveling blade cover and a full size, not
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:48.800]   a sample, but a full size jar or what do you call that bottle of the foaming shave gel
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.640]   or tube of the shave cream.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   That's actually what I use.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:56.040]   I love how it smells and I love how it smooths my skin and makes it easy to shave.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.400]   Never a nick, never a cut, never a scrape because of Harry's.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.080]   I just love him.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.040]   Now we got a better deal for you because when you go to harry's.com/macbreak you can get
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.600]   that Truman kit for 10 bucks.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:15.720]   If you're going to get $5 off your first order, whatever it may be, $5 off at harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s.com/macbreak.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:23.560]   Hey, if it's good enough for the beard, it's good enough for you.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:26.000]   Did we send you that or did you just go out and get it?
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000]   No.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.400]   They're a sponsor, your show probably.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.920]   I got it from Harry's.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.920]   Yes.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:31.920]   I use it.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:32.920]   It's great.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:33.920]   Love them.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:34.920]   Love them.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:35.920]   You can use Jim's code if you want.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:36.920]   It's okay.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:39.480]   I bet you all have offer codes.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.280]   No, they haven't sponsored in a while so I don't have a code.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.280]   Okay.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.280]   Sponsor.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.280]   Buy an ad on Jim's.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.280]   What is your podcast, Jim?
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   Is it loop insight.com?
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.880]   Is that where I should go to get it?
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.920]   Yeah, it's the Dalrymple report.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:53.920]   The Dalrymple report.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:55.920]   It's such a good name.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.440]   That would be good in Scottish.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.080]   It's the Dalrymple report.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.080]   The report.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.640]   I'm listening to the Dalrymple report.
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.640]   I love it.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.440]   If you're good at loop insight.com and click on the Dalrymple report podcast.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.280]   You know what?
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.280]   What?
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.760]   I am my heritage is Scottish.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.360]   So I know I can tell.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.360]   I can.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360]   I can talk Scottish.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.520]   I can see that you would look good in a kill.
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.880]   The Dalrymple report is incredibly close to Guns N' Roses.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.400]   It's just very similar.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.840]   I bet you have manly calves.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:33.360]   Dave Whiskis on your, oh, both Dave and Joe on to talk about airplane mode.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.360]   That's nice.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.120]   And the perils of performing live.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:40.120]   That's on the most recently.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:41.560]   There are a lot of perils.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.280]   There are perils indeed.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.200]   The perils of Pauline.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.520]   Jim, you want to give us a heavy metal plug?
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.800]   I want to give you a hard rock plug.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:52.800]   Hard rock.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.800]   Hard rock.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.960]   So there's a band called Monster Truck.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.760]   Absolutely made no doubt.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.000]   No, no.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.440]   They are so good.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:09.840]   I get so many emails from listeners of Macbreak Weekly when I recommended Blackstone Cherry.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:14.800]   Well, Monster Truck is just like Blackstone Cherry.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.040]   They're not metal.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.400]   They're, they're bluesy, hard rock and it.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.160]   Oh, I love the songs of a manly cow.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.800]   It's a little loud in here.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.800]   See?
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:29.280]   I like this kind of rock.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:36.440]   This is my kind of rock.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.960]   They don't make music like this anymore.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.000]   Oh, it's, it's blowing out our speakers.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]   See?
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.920]   That is just great music.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.320]   I love it.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.320]   I love it.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.720]   So yeah, that's, that's who I'd like to recommend.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.800]   I listened to them a lot.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:59.440]   Just because it's, it's just straight ahead rock, you know, it's just great songs.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.080]   I love it.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.080]   Monster Truck.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:10.800]   I love Monster Truck dot com and the new album is out now.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.520]   Awesome.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.520]   That's hysterical.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.520]   I love it.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.520]   I love it.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.160]   See, Leo, I give you a recommendations that other people just came in.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.160]   No, I love them.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:25.400]   I'm taking off my clothes.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.400]   Oh, no.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   Who can't do that again?
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.600]   Looks like they're building the Apple campus there.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:34.440]   David for 24.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:40.400]   I talked to somebody who's working on the Apple campus, which shall remain nameless.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.160]   And he talked about those big panes of glass, you know, on the circular, because the wall
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.720]   of it is all curved glass.
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:52.760]   He says those cost $135,000 each.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:58.840]   And when they order them, they have to order them in tens because they, to get the foundry
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.440]   up and running, they don't want to make less.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.800]   They can't make one.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:07.800]   And he said that can add up because at least four or five have been broken by people backing
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.560]   into them or other accidents on the job site.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.560]   Wow.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:15.960]   And when you break one, that's not 135 grand down the tubes.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:21.960]   That's $1.35 million down the tubes because you got to get 10 more.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.960]   Oh, wow.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:25.320]   Well, I mean, that's how my house works.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.760]   Well, it's not how your house works.
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:35.280]   He also said again, no names here that they did not understand or predict the engineering
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:42.840]   firms involved and not understand or predict the amount of heat and the buckling and the
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.360]   expansion that the campus would undergo.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.080]   And he said, we're having a lot of trouble keeping the floors flat.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.720]   Holy shit.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:52.720]   Whoops.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.720]   Whoops.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.720]   Whoops.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.560]   So he was saying, you know, I'm thinking September next year before they're opening.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.800]   I said, I bet they're rushing though to get that theater done.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.120]   He said, yeah, he said, you know, it's smaller than you'd think the theater.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:05.120]   It is.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.120]   It is almost done.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.760]   But yeah, there's some inside stuff.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.840]   I don't know if it's true.
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.200]   I didn't check his ID.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.360]   Sounds true.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:18.720]   Every college campus has at least 15 really good urban legends about the buildings, including
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.880]   the yes, but the engineer of the library didn't end.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:24.480]   Didn't factor in how much the books would weigh.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480]   Whoops.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.240]   They put these extra crosses in.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.240]   Yes.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.240]   Yeah, they'll fix it.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.240]   Of course.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.240]   They'll fix it.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.240]   Of course.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.240]   Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:34.240]   I'm having a hot ball pick.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.080]   I like, I love the videos on attested.com.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:42.120]   And there was one recently where Adam Savage was making a foam core replica of the house
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.120]   he grew up in.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:50.360]   But as usual, it's like fascinating to like watch someone who's good at doing something,
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.360]   do things.
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:52.360]   And also you learn techniques.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.320]   So he had like on this work table, like these steel blocks that were like like this,
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.560]   and he keeps like using them.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.680]   You just put it in places like pushing out of the way.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:02.720]   And like the eighth time he did that, he stopped.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:06.320]   So oh, by the way, these, these are called one, two, three blocks, and they're useful
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320]   for like a hundred different things.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.400]   And I'm using it like this, me, like this.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:15.000]   And so I went to Amazon and they cost like you can buy a pair of these steel blocks for
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.440]   like $13, $14.
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:21.320]   And their pertinent features are that they're called one, two, three blocks because it's
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.880]   exactly one inch thick, exactly one inch wide and exactly three inches.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:31.720]   Excuse me, two inches wide, exactly three inches on this dimension.
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.640]   And all the corners are exactly 90 degrees.
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:39.000]   So you can do, I just bought them and put them like on my desk here.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.800]   And the number of times where I just needed to keep a cable from walking away.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.880]   So I just put this one pound block of steel on top of it.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.880]   It doesn't crush it.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.280]   Just keeps it from walking away.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.000]   Or every time that I needed to prop up something.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.520]   So I just sort of like sandwiched between these two things.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.560]   And suddenly I've got this vertical like wall or something like that.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:01.400]   The times where he was using it in a way that I've also been using it, which is you
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:07.520]   can just sort of, because these are perfectly square, you can basically, if you need to,
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:11.840]   if you're gluing like a vertical thing to like a horizontal thing, you can just sort
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.000]   of like sandwich between these two.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.240]   These are two again, one pound steel block.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.000]   So the vertical thing is not going to go walking away or tilting away until the glue
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]   has set.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.160]   It's not that this is for this one thing, it's just that you now have a really, really
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:32.560]   one pound block of milled steel that is perfectly square and is of perfectly known dimensions.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.200]   And so if you just have this on your desk, you will find places, times and places where
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:41.880]   you need a weight or something that is perfectly a right angle or something that's exactly
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:42.960]   an inch.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.760]   And so, and also they're kind of like really intense Legos.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.360]   You know, I feel like I want to go to Home Depot.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:53.160]   These, a lot of these holes are threaded and I just want to buy some like bolts to see
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:58.720]   what I can put the, if I, if I want to actually like make a little like steel fort or something
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.400]   out of them, I don't know, whatever, but they're cheap enough that I'm going to buy like another
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:08.200]   set or two because they're just like really cool things to just to have around and really
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.520]   useful things once you have the holes appropriate for like putting a pen or a pencil in.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:13.520]   Could they be like that?
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.960]   No, they're not quite big enough.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.960]   I've got my, I've got my, can that be a cool pen holder?
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:20.960]   That's what I was thinking.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:23.960]   They're not, they're not quite big enough for that.
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.240]   I'm looking for like, I've got my spudger.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.880]   So yeah, we'll, we'll hold your, it'll hold your spudger really nicely.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:29.880]   Okay.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.120]   But I think a, a pencil would work just fine.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:36.040]   I don't think that a, a most pens would fit correctly.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.040]   You can get them.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.160]   They're about 15 bucks on Amazon for the pair.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:44.960]   And I noticed that they have pairs with no holes, one hole or all the holes.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.320]   Well, because the, these are actual machinist tools and there's, if you, if you look on
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:54.040]   the, if you go on the web and look for like machinists, blogs and machinist message boards,
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.680]   there are all kinds of people who discuss ways in which they use their blocks, but everybody
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.960]   has a different list of things they use them for.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.820]   Again, the salient feature is just that here is a massive metal that is exactly precisely
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.440]   a certain, it's not almost an inch.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.280]   It's exactly an inch, not almost 90 degrees.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.920]   It's exactly 90 degrees.
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.640]   So if you need to like a dial in a machine, if you want to test to see if a micrometer
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:20.400]   is working, or if you want to, like, if you need to make sure there's a certain gap between
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.120]   that so that your tool head does not go smashing into the table, you can screw this down and
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.640]   dog it down.
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:28.360]   And they're actually not even less expensive secondhand on eBay.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.920]   They really are like about six or seven bucks each.
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.440]   The only caveat is that it's going, these arrived like wrapped, dipped in oil, machinist
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.840]   oil and wrapped in paper.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:37.840]   So they're rust.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.840]   So they don't rust.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:42.560]   And so I did have to sort of like, you know, you're so nice and shiny.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.560]   Is what did you get?
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.560]   Are they just hardened?
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.560]   Where did you get?
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:46.560]   I mean, which ones did you get?
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:47.560]   Those are those.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.800]   That's exactly Amazon link I sent you is exactly what I got.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:50.800]   It is cool.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:52.560]   Like just it's just a beautiful object.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.560]   You don't know where this came from.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:57.000]   And it's just a nice thing to have.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.680]   And but I bet you could use it as a pen holder, but I'm thinking I'm thinking about I have
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.280]   a big box of just like metal findings.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:09.160]   I bet that if I put this between a couple blocks with some spacers in between, I really
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:14.120]   want to make this into more of a permanent sort of cable stay by having these separated
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.360]   by just enough so that you could pass a cable through them sideways.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.520]   But as soon as you lay the cable flat, like it can't escape from there, just lots of
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.760]   ideas come to mind.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:26.080]   But again, it's just it's a cool thing that doesn't cost a lot of money.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.960]   And once you find it on your desk, you will find that, Oh, I really needed something that
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.360]   is perfectly square to keep this thing from falling over.
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.440]   Oh, look, I've got this thing that is heavy enough that something's not going to fall
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.440]   over.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:40.920]   And it makes you makes you feel like a makes you feel like a real nerd to have something
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.680]   having a machinist tool on there.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.800]   And yeah, it is just shiny and beautiful.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:50.120]   Now you can also get them coated in titanium, titanium nickel coating.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.120]   Yep.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.360]   I don't know if you I don't know.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.160]   It's a little more expensive.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.920]   I like how shiny yours are though.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.480]   There again, they're beautiful.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:03.480]   And even if you don't have like a nice LED studio lighting, it's it's like the it's like
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.920]   a night the opening to like a 1983 CGI demo.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:11.200]   Where's all like perfect geometric things.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.720]   It's always perfectly reflective.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:18.040]   And yeah, though, I got I got to thank Adam Savage, just like one of those things that
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:20.080]   you don't you've never heard of.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.160]   But then it's like this is one of the neatest things I've ever spent $15 on in my life
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:26.200]   because I really enjoy having.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.000]   And they're exactly they like true to 0.000002.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.400]   Yeah, they're precise.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:36.820]   And you can buy other versions of this that are like $80.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:41.120]   And they come in a Rosewood box because if you if you are if you are.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.200]   Oh, no, no, not as a gift.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:50.960]   It's like if you are like building spacecraft components that has to be within a 0.00001 percent
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.840]   tolerance, you know that this is no more.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:56.560]   This is not off by more than your 0.00001.
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:01.680]   An electrons fart is thicker than the amount that that might be off of.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:04.440]   It's actual measurement.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:07.440]   Somebody saying they should be magnetic.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.600]   That'd be cool.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.800]   I don't know if I want to have a magnetic thing.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.800]   Okay.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.720]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.800]   Oh, Renee's muted.
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:21.160]   I don't know if that's us or you.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.160]   No, it's me.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.240]   I'm positive that Andy and Jason Snell and people have picked this before, but I'm going
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:31.320]   back to comicsology today, now owned by Amazon, of course, and it was a great app where you
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.080]   could go and buy comic books, you know, comic books that were day in date, more and more
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.440]   increasingly with actual physical releases.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.840]   And what they've gone and done now is made comicsology unlimited.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:46.280]   So yeah, upfront, we should know there's no Marvel in DC participating.
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:48.760]   Marvel has their own offering, Marvel Unlimited.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:54.000]   But if you want the independent comics, if you want the other comic publishers, this
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.080]   is a great way to sort of get all you can eat sort of Netflix style for especially indie,
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.400]   really creative, creator owned, a lot of licensed properties here as well.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:09.800]   But just yet another endless source of comic book entertainment that is just great on any
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:10.800]   iPad.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.720]   I've used it on iPhone too, but on the iPad, especially a beautiful iPad Pro, it's just
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:16.440]   phenomenal experience.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:22.160]   So again, there are caveats, no Marvel, no DC, but there are so many really, really, really
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.160]   great titles besides that.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:30.560]   And I think they're including now at launch Dark Horse Image, IDW, Boom, Oni, Archie, Valiant,
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.760]   Fantagraphics, and more.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:38.680]   So if you, it's a great way to actually learn about comics that aren't Marvel in DC, including,
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:44.120]   you know, Joss Whedon did three or three or so seasons of Buffy after the TV show went down.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.600]   So you can still go and buy Alacart, all the main, you know, all the Marvel and DC stuff
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.800]   that you want, you can buy them per issue, but you can just subscribe to Unlimited and
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.800]   get more comics and you could comfortably read in a normal human lifetime.
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.000]   Yeah, that, that, that you get the first month for the six bucks a month, the first
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000]   month is free.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.120]   So even if you just say that for two months, I'm going to read every issue of Usage Ojimbo,
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.320]   one of my favorite comics ever, and every issue of Saga, another one of my favorite comics
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:11.320]   ever.
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.720]   And as soon as I've read every single issue that's ever been published or that's available
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.920]   for the comics, I will then cancel that six bucks extremely well spent.
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:21.320]   Yeah, phenomenal deal.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.280]   I am going to show you something that I refused from a long time to do, but now they've talked
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:28.600]   me into it on Saturday.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:35.320]   We're going to take my nice sweet Macbook Pro 2012 and turn it into a Chromebook.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:38.720]   No, well, here's one of the nice things.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:39.720]   You can do it.
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:41.920]   Turn it into a dual boot Chromebook if you want.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.000]   This Chrome OS has been around as an open source project.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.240]   They call it Chromium OS for some time, but it really has been for developers.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:52.600]   In fact, if you go to the Chromium OS site, you'll see you have to build from source.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.720]   A company called Neverware has taken it and made it so that you can install it as you
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:02.720]   would a Linux, for instance, as a disk image on a USB key on a variety of older hardware,
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:06.640]   both Windows and Mac.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:09.360]   And they have it now, a dual boot feature for some Macs.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:16.480]   This is free for individual use, $25 for schools, $49 per device per year for businesses.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:22.240]   And then you get some extra stuff with that, including tech support and licenses are transferable.
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.600]   So if you saw all the announcements Google made at Google I/O last week and you said,
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.160]   "Boy, I wouldn't mind trying Android on Chrome OS."
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.600]   Well, one way you could do it is to make a dual boot and it wouldn't take much of your
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.600]   hard drive.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.400]   I think Chrome OS will run pretty well in four or five gigabytes.
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.080]   And you can make a dual boot on your Mac.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:46.000]   So if you want to watch it happen live, we're going to do that on Saturday on the new screen
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   savers.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.280]   I'm going to take this MacBook Pro I've been using.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.360]   And it's four years old.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.560]   It's not state of the art.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.760]   And I think a lot of schools can use pretty old, like even up to like eight year old Mac
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.760]   books to do this.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:03.240]   One way you can get computers in the hands of kids, take old computers, Windows and Mac,
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.840]   and turn them into Chromebooks.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.240]   So we're going to try this neverwhere.com if you want to try it yourself.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.560]   I think it's an interesting idea.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.120]   It really is just a Linux distro.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.240]   I mean, Google won't say that.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.240]   But it is.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:22.680]   It's a specially designed Linux distro.
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:27.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.600]   And I'm so glad you could have been could be here.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.520]   So glad you could be here, Jim Dal Rimple.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.320]   Look forward to your party, the Beard Bash.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.200]   I'm happy to be invited.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200]   Thank you.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200]   Leo's good to be here.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.700]   We'd love to have you on loop insight.com.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:44.080]   He's at Jay Dal Rimple on the Twitter.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:46.160]   Does the Beard have its own account?
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:47.160]   It does.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.840]   But it's not me that does it.
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.840]   Is it Jim's beard?
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.840]   The beard.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:51.840]   I don't know.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.840]   I don't know what it is.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.200]   But my beard has a Twitter account.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.480]   My Heineken bottle has a Twitter account.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.560]   I don't do any of them.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.800]   I only do mine.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:07.920]   So yeah, but every once in a while, my Heineken bottle will tweet me.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:08.920]   You know, that's kind of funny.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:09.920]   I love it.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:10.920]   Jim, great to see you.
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:11.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:12.920]   We appreciate it.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:13.920]   We'll see you soon.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:14.920]   Thank you.
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:15.920]   Renee Richie at imore.com.
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.840]   And of course, not only does Jim have his podcast, Renee's got his podcast.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:24.320]   You'll find his at imore.com.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.080]   And now now two of them.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.360]   Although I noted that when Georgia Dow was on Twitter on Sunday, I was looking at the
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:34.440]   new Apple Talk wasn't on their website yet.
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.840]   I mean, it's a Drupal view that's supposed to be replaced, but it takes a developer to
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:38.840]   do that view thing.
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:43.760]   So we've been doing it at imore.com/apple-talk and go straight there.
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.800]   We just had Horace dead you on to talk about Apple car.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.800]   Love him.
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:48.800]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.040]   And this week we're going to have Carolina, Moanae, as they talking about a system technology
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:54.640]   like Siri and Google now and all that kind of stuff.
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:55.640]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:58.080]   The new podcast, imore.com/apple-talk.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:03.080]   You can go directly there and soon it will be at imore.com/podcast.
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.080]   Yes.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.080]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.080]   Killio.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:11.160]   Andy Inaco, he's the Chicago Sun Times.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:15.400]   And I think always a fun to have you on anything you want to plug.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:16.400]   You got the material podcast.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.240]   I bet you talked a little bit about Google I/O this week.
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:20.240]   Yeah.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:25.240]   As a matter of fact, we're having a whole bunch of Google's VR engineers on the show.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:28.160]   Probably going to be next week's show.
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:31.880]   I don't know if we're recording it this week or next week, but we got a lot of exciting
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:33.640]   things to talk about today, if that's for sure.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:34.800]   Yeah, I'll be listening.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.800]   That's great.
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:36.800]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:37.800]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.440]   We do Mac break weekly.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:43.240]   Every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.160]   If you want to watch live, we'd love it if you would.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:49.720]   Join us in our chat at irc.twit.tv.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:51.480]   But if you can't, don't worry.
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:58.280]   The "Dame Audio" in video is always available at our website, twit.tv/mbw for this show,
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:01.520]   or in your favorite podcatcher, and we're everywhere.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:06.880]   And the new BitTorrent application on Apple TV should be up BitTorrent Live.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.880]   And I think we're one of the debut channels on there.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:13.840]   So if you want to watch live via BitTorrent Live, you can do that as well directly on
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.760]   your Apple TV.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:19.360]   That's fine with me, of course, that makes it six now.
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:23.840]   That's an Apple TV that will, at least, that will let you watch Twit on your Apple TV.
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:29.040]   And we got it on the Roku and Windows and iOS and Android and everywhere you want to
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.080]   make sure you subscribe so you don't miss an episode.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.480]   Now break time is over.
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:34.040]   So back to work with you.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:44.040]   [MUSIC]
