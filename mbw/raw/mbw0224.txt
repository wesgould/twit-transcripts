[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.640]   Always gets delayed by NFL football.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920]   We have been delayed by the Chrome OS announcement,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.000]   which was certainly worth everybody staying up
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.160]   an extra hour and 15 minutes for.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.200]   It's middle of the afternoon here in the East Coast.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.840]   We're not used to being up this early.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.240]   I've got a lot of really great people with me today.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.040]   Unfortunately, Leo is elsewhere.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.400]   Alex also is elsewhere, pursuing lives of fulfillment.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.640]   So instead I have with me Jason Snell from Macworld.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.480]   How you doing, Jason?
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.040]   I'm doing great.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.080]   Thanks for having me here.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.200]   I'm holding down the fort here in the Twit cottage.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.360]   You don't understand.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360]   You're not being held.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.560]   You're not holding down here.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.920]   We're holding down you.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.160]   Lock him up, boys.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.840]   That's true.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   That's true.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   Another publishing Titan.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.520]   We've got Adam Anks from tidbits.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.760]   Hey, how you doing, Adam?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.440]   Fine.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.960]   Thank you.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600]   Nice to see you, Andy.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.440]   You're certainly--
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.720]   I will say that you are the most handsome of all of our--
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.680]   Clearly, people will be able to speak her hair.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.480]   Which one of those group exercises
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   competitively every single day?
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.760]   Ooh.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.520]   Well, if I don't fall asleep during the show,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.840]   that'll be good given what I just ran today.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   So--
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.640]   Excellent.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.680]   You also have the headset that makes you look the most
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.720]   like a 1992 CBS Sports commentator.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.160]   So you've got to thank him for--
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Well, OK.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.200]   So, let's talk about this.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.440]   We've got two really, really great developers on our side
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   here, Dave Nainian.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.400]   Dave, how are you doing?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.280]   Doing well, Andy.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.200]   Thanks for having me here.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   Yes.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.560]   And Rich Siegel of Bear Bones.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.800]   Rich.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.920]   Come going from his cave.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   I just want to say I'm a little miffed with Google
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   for causing us delay.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600]   I had a cut and color scheduled for 3 o'clock,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.240]   and I had to push it off.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   So I'm not thrilled about that.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.320]   But otherwise, yes, thank you for having me.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.360]   Great to see my esteemed colleagues, especially you, Dave.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.760]   It looked like you got a cut and color,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.800]   but you were so busy you didn't tell them to stop.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   OK, I was also going to go with,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.040]   how is the weather there eight feet from the sun?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.960]   But we've got a lot to get through.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.480]   People are still going there in about a day.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.880]   So I can guarantee that.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   We would like to introduce you to your co-host here.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   Rich, would you also like to introduce us to your co-host?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.240]   Your Kathy Lee is a word.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   This is Bruno.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.440]   And he's here because if I didn't put him up there
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.520]   and give him something to do, he would just constantly
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.960]   be here bothering me.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.280]   So at least he can bother all of us.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.000]   At least in an entertaining fashion.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.480]   Exactly.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   But he'll be quiet up there and that's good.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.720]   Excellent.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   Now, was everybody watching the Google Chrome announcement?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   Oh, Avonle.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.200]   Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.040]   It was a typical Google announcement
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.840]   in which they're willing to tell you how proud they are
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.960]   of every single electron in the system
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.200]   and where they placed it.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.760]   Not so much on how people are going
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   to be excited about actually using it.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.400]   The bullet points are that for now, for today,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000]   Google Chrome and any webkit browser
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.200]   with the right extension will have access to the Google Chrome
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.080]   store and get access to a brand new, more sophisticated
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.960]   collection of web-based apps.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.240]   In the middle of next year, we're
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.280]   going to start seeing Chrome OS notebooks, which
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.720]   look just like traditional notebooks,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.120]   screen like 12 inch notebooks, but are extremely thin
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.920]   clients that can run these web apps just from wherever they
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.440]   are.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.680]   Hopefully, they won't cost a lot of money.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.880]   Interestingly, physically, they look
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.080]   like exactly like a normal notebook.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   We're expecting--
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.200]   Not quite, Andy.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.760]   Well, remember--
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.240]   Look at--
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.880]   No caps lock key.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   No caps lock.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   No caps lock key, which means that nobody
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.720]   on World of Warcraft message boards
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   will be able to use it.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.960]   So, Adam, what do you think about all of this?
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.120]   Adam, what did you think about all of this?
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.760]   I mean, I'm interested to see.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.240]   Honestly, the whole thin client thing
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.880]   has been talked about for so long.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.040]   But I think we actually are getting close to the point
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.560]   where it could happen.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.960]   Honestly, I use Gmail.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.360]   I use Google Docs a lot.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.520]   And they work pretty darn well.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.720]   When I'm not trying to do a big document or something
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   really complicated, that's Google Docs is really
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.280]   what we need.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   And the collaboration, particularly now that they
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.960]   built in the etherpad stuff so you can be real time,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.080]   works pretty well.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.440]   And a lot more of what we do in the modern world
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.760]   is collaborative than it used to be.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.840]   So for a lot of situations, I can
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.160]   see a Chrome device being what a lot of work groups need.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.440]   And if they can somehow keep Facebook off it,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.120]   then probably productivity will just skyrocket.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.440]   Jason, what did you think?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.320]   My problem with it seemed to be that it seems like a really
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.800]   interesting one window interface,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.560]   but I don't know if it's going to really appeal to users.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.640]   Yeah, I mean, there's a class of users
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.760]   who don't really use their computer for anything,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.080]   except web-based stuff.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.920]   And I think that's what they're going for here.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   I think that I was thinking while I was watching the presentation,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.720]   very clever of you, by the way, to call us here an hour early
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.480]   and then make us all sit and watch the Google presentation.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.440]   I see your plans, Mr. Host.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.040]   It was mostly we just wanted to make sure you were all sober.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   So we had enough time to find somebody else.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.840]   Very, very clever.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.560]   Well, that's why there are four of us, right?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.240]   You can just bump one of us off at any point if we offend you.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.840]   The thought I had was we may be entering a period where
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.960]   the person who wants the cheapest sort of low-featured laptop,
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.800]   they just want something cheap, won't be looking at a Windows
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.840]   laptop anymore.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   Perhaps Chrome is the new sort of baseline,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.360]   which leads me to the next point, which is then
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.520]   what does that mean for Windows?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.160]   If Windows is no longer-- is Microsoft going to start saying,
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.960]   well, no, Windows is a premium experience with apps?
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.840]   That's just a very different kind of scenario.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.920]   Microsoft hasn't really been in that before, where there's
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.880]   been a legitimate kind of competitor down below them.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.480]   And that's what Chrome might be for a lot of people.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.560]   I mean, I personally wouldn't use one of these systems
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.920]   because I would rather spend a little more money
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.320]   and get something more full-featured with actual live apps.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.680]   But there are lots of people who aren't like that.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   And for them, this is intriguing, at least.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040]   What does this mean for Apple?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.240]   Because Mr. Jobs has been talking all along
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.200]   about how HTML5 is going to bring in a whole new wave
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.560]   of incredibly good, with-based Apple caps.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.760]   And I have to guess that over in Cupertino,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.520]   he's not thinking, wow, this is a great piece of news for Apple.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   They're absolutely on our side.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.760]   And a new issue of Google Day Taunt is going to happen.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.120]   I wonder if Rich or Dave, what do you guys think about that?
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.960]   Rich or Dave?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   OK, me.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.120]   I'm on screen.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.680]   I see me.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.440]   Me, me, me, me.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.320]   OK.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.200]   Well, looking at the announcement, what little tiny bit
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.680]   I've heard of it, I agree.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.560]   It's an interesting segment that they've
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.960]   carved out for themselves.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.440]   If you want to go into a store and say, well,
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.840]   I'm only going to pay $200 for something with which I
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   can connect to the internet, surf the web,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.960]   and use my Google hosted services, well, sure,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.640]   that's the real deal.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.520]   You know, the five of us here aren't the target audience
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.040]   for this device, but I suspect we know people who are.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.120]   And as much as we'd like to see them using Max and iPads,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   I think there is a place for this sort of thing.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.640]   On the other hand, yes.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.280]   You know, there's been talk of the thin client,
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.200]   the network computer, the diskless operating system,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.280]   forever.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.720]   The technology moved on a lot in that time period.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.640]   Is it time?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.800]   It might be.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.520]   Is it going to change the world?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   Probably not.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.560]   That's sort of my two cents on that.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.880]   Well, where it may make a difference, honestly,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.120]   is if we are in a situation where you're in a classroom
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.360]   where there's just no money for real computers for everybody,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.040]   or once you start getting into the developing world,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.440]   where they're simply never going
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.720]   to buy an iPad or a MacBook, that if you can make one
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.160]   of these incredibly cheap computers
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.400]   and have 3G connectivity because that's what you're going
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.600]   to have in a less developed area and have access
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.920]   for these things, that could be a big deal.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.440]   Again, we're not the market market market,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.880]   but in many ways, possibly even the first world may be
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.320]   a little bit less of the target market in some ways
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.200]   than places where cost is absolutely paramount
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.360]   and connectivity is done via cellular anyway.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.200]   It's just a really change that there's going to be
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.920]   out there buying an iPad next year.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.800]   They didn't say anything about price,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.440]   so we don't know if this is going to be Google TV,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.280]   where it sounds great until you find out it costs $400.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   Yeah, I think it's got to be really, really cheap.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.680]   And my understanding is that the entire reason
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.920]   why netbooks sold well for a while and are starting
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.760]   to get hurt by the tablets is that they were cheap.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.880]   The people wanted cheap, cheap computers and, oh,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   didn't matter if it had a hard little keyboard
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.360]   and a hard little screen.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   If it was $200, they'd buy it.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.640]   And so if Chrome can go in there and basically take over
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   from that buy a network because it's cheap,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.680]   then maybe it'll do well.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.440]   And I think Jason actually brought up a really interesting
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.560]   point, whereas Microsoft makes a ton of money
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.680]   in those Windows licenses that go with cheap computers.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   And if Chrome is going to take over that,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.960]   and I can't believe that the netbook manufacturers
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   wouldn't want to do that because that gets them out
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.120]   of another cost they don't have to pay,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.640]   then Microsoft may see a bit of a hit from this.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.040]   It seems--
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.560]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.160]   Sorry, I was going to say that it seems to me
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.960]   that the primary market for this is really the corporations.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   I mean, these are incredibly manageable, super cheap,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.240]   instantly replaceable computers that any guy in an IT department
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.200]   can actually deploy to their users without having to worry about.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   Yeah, it might go to consumers, but I don't
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.120]   know how many consumers there are going to be who want something
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.600]   that can just go on the web, but then can't play some of those
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.480]   high bandwidth games and things that those cheap computers tend
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.760]   to go with, these World of Warcraft type of things
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.800]   that just aren't going to work in a browser experience.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.280]   You look at the kinds of games that they were showing during the demo
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.000]   and they're things like Poppitt and a really bad version
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.200]   of Bejeweled or something.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.040]   They're just not the kind of immersive experiences
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.680]   that you'd expect.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.520]   Do you think developers are going to get excited
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.120]   about developing apps for Chrome?
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   It's a certain developer certainly.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.800]   I mean, if it's a money making opportunity,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.480]   a lot of people are going to get excited about it.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.160]   But it's a very, very limited environment.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   You don't see a lot of people developing easily deployable flash
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.360]   apps for the general public, except in small markets,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.160]   whereas you see a lot of people building
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.040]   Eve Android or iOS apps where you're
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.760]   able to provide them with a really great experience.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.920]   In fact, look at what they just announced with Android 2.3
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.400]   with lots more hardware access, lots more ability
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.120]   to generate excellent games and great graphics
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.280]   and things like that.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.440]   Whereas that's not at all where they're going with Chrome.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.720]   I think really Chrome is for a very specific market.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   And that market, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.160]   is corporations and road warriors
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.360]   on the go with those corporations who can access their websites
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.240]   and their Citrix apps and things like that on the road?
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.320]   That definitely occurred to me that just like the BlackBerry
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.040]   isn't a really great consumer phone,
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.960]   but it's a great phone as a kind of a company buys 500 of.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.120]   And they just issue them because they're so easy to maintain
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.520]   that maybe this will be the sort of way
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   that Google Chrome notebooks, notebooks, go out,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.240]   because they auto update, they have no storage,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.120]   so maybe there's less of a security risk.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.720]   Maybe there'll be a day when people have to travel,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.440]   commute into work with three different computers.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.000]   They're iPad, they're an actual notebook
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.960]   for buying all their eBay purchases,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.120]   and then their state issued notebook.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   Google also had another really cool announcement
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.560]   that actually got me more interested yesterday,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.240]   in which they finally opened their Google e-book store.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.840]   They've always had Google books
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.960]   where they will give you every single public domain book
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.080]   ever given.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   And after a whole bunch of lawsuits
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.800]   that will give you previews of every single copyrighted book,
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.600]   every ever printed, but now they have their own bookstore
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.280]   that sells books in the ePub format controlled
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.960]   with Adobe DRM, so you can read them all online
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.400]   or you can install them on any device that supports Adobe DRM.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.480]   I bought Steve Martin's book yesterday
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   and installed it on the Nook, on my iPad, on my iPod,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.480]   interesting that it seems as though that now there's another,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.080]   that 800 pound gorilla used to be Amazon with their Kindle,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.320]   now there's a thousand pound gorilla that wants to wrestle.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.720]   What do you guys think?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.360]   Yeah, the Google books thing is interesting.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.760]   I mean, they've been planning that for a while.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   I know that they've been talking about it.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.920]   So, you know, for me, I looked at it.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.520]   It's not the iPad app anyway.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.400]   It's not great.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.240]   It's probably the weakest of the apps, but it's new.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.320]   The one feature about the Google books that I like,
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.560]   oh, I should also say as one of those publishing titans
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.640]   on the panel, I think the Google book terms aren't very good,
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.160]   actually.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.840]   I think compared to Amazon and Apple,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.640]   I think they take a bigger share.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.320]   I may be wrong about that, but I was trying to look
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.880]   that up yesterday and it doesn't sound great.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.840]   What I do like about it is that they seem to be able
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.400]   to embed both a physical version of the book
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.680]   as well as this, essentially ePub.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.240]   It's like a plain text, marked up text version of the book.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.880]   And those ePub versions are really great,
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.600]   especially if you're on a little device like a phone,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.440]   because you can reflow the text and it's not like a page,
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   like a PDF that you have to scan around.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.040]   But if you're on a tablet, especially the iPad,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.160]   that experience of the original book can actually be
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.360]   really beautiful and really rich.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.800]   And for the books that offer both,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   you can actually toggle back and forth.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   And right now, the examples that they have,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.920]   like I got great expectations, it actually has the ePub version
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.560]   and then you can flip over and see a scan
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.000]   of like a 19th century edition of great expectations,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   which is a little bit weird.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.800]   But if you imagine that with a hardcover book today
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.440]   and on your iPad, you could read it and it uses the typeface
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   and the chapter breaks and the line breaks
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.560]   and all of this nice stuff that's in the hardcover version.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.000]   And then you flip over to your iPhone
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.680]   and you can just read the plain text of it
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.800]   until you get back there.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.880]   That's kind of compelling and new.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.040]   They didn't make a big deal out of it,
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.760]   but that's the one thing that I took away and said,
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.400]   that's interesting.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.040]   - That's the standard thing that they've been doing
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.240]   with all their public domain stuff.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   I think it's mostly so that if the OCR screws up,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.640]   you can see, okay, I don't think the character's name
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.440]   is Mr. Bixel flipped.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.480]   Let's see what the actual page looks like.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.040]   One thing that I was kind of curious about is that
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.680]   when I bought, Steve Martin's book on the Kindle,
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.440]   I bought it on Google eBooks
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.400]   and I bought it on another platform just to compare.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   And on the Google eBooks version,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.200]   they deleted all the really good formatting.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.560]   It's an interesting book in that they have,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.200]   he has reproductions of oil paintings
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.720]   like in the middle of a page.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.400]   Usually they're marked up with links
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.720]   so you can learn more about it.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.600]   That was there in the Barnes and Noble edition,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.880]   but it wasn't in the Google e-book edition.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.920]   So I don't know if they're kind of cheapening out for people.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.320]   - I don't know, does the world really need
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.280]   yet another e-book store?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.160]   I mean, I guess it'll all shake out,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   but that was my only real hesitation
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.560]   with that announcement.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.360]   It's like, boy, it's another store.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.720]   At least Google's trying to be broad with it
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.160]   and get it on every platform possible,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.840]   but it is yet another, so it's like Amazon or Apple
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.480]   or Google or Barnes and Noble.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.040]   - Yeah, they have to come.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.960]   - Well, with something other than my price,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.320]   because right now everybody's using the publisher prices,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.200]   so there's no difference at all.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   And so they're trying to do it on features.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.520]   And I don't know, Google store,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.280]   Google store and Google's books
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.240]   looked like the least featured of all of them.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.480]   In fact, I went over how you have to get an e-pub
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.360]   onto a lot of these devices with Adobe Digital editions.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.440]   And it was like 25 steps of horror
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.520]   to try to get it on there.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.360]   It looked pretty bad.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.560]   - Now you know what my life is like.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.920]   - No, seriously, these, I mean,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.760]   we're getting all of these sites
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.720]   and it is getting to be really, really hard
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.080]   to get your books on them.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.480]   That yes, if you're a big publisher,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.960]   probably you have the resources
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.400]   to do a huge amount of work that's necessary.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.480]   But for smaller publishers,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.440]   I think it's gonna be a real problem.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.200]   One thing that many smaller publishers are doing
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.760]   is working with O'Reilly Media,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   who will handle a lot of the reformatting
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.040]   and dealing with the content management systems
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   in all these different places.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.400]   Because it's just tough.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.800]   Every one of them is different.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.120]   We've had a lot of our books in Google Books,
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   then Google Editions,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.920]   and they're showing up in Google eBooks,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.280]   but they all seem to be old ones.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.400]   And I have to say that it was a kind of a rough experience,
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   honestly, that we'd upload a PDF
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.120]   and it would appear three months later.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.320]   The feedback loop was insane.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.240]   And at some point I just said,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.640]   this is too much work and they're support persons.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.680]   Oh, I'll do it for you.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.080]   Great, I sent her books.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.600]   It took her like a month to be able to get it
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.360]   with three or four different tries, things never worked.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.200]   So from behind the scenes,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.480]   it's held together with Spitt and Balochwine.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.160]   Not that the iBook store is all that much better,
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.160]   but what we see as consumers is a whole lot different
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.560]   from what our publishers are being exposed to.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.280]   The tools are clumsy and crude,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.360]   and every one of them is different.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   So it's not a great situation for publishers,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.720]   and I think we'll be seeing a lot of books in these places,
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.840]   but I honestly don't think it will be making a huge difference
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.160]   in publishers' businesses for quite some time.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.240]   Okay, yeah, I think we can all agree,
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.120]   we gotta go to commercial soon,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.200]   but we all agree that the actual reading experience
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.240]   isn't quite as good on the iPad,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.200]   the iPhone on the Kindle app or the iBook's app.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.560]   It's readable, but I'm not sure if it would be
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.680]   my preferred way of tickling this book.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.400]   Any found comments about that?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.240]   No, I think you're right.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.640]   I think it's a 1.0 product,
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.040]   and you'll give them a chance,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.960]   but I'm not entirely convinced that Google
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.760]   is gonna provide the best book reading experience app.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.320]   And somebody in the chat room mentioned
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.640]   that me complaining about all these different stores
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.360]   is like saying, you know, what?
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.560]   Saying, why don't we have to have more than target, right?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.440]   But that's not the issue.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   The issue is, if I buy a book over here
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.680]   and a book over there and a book over there,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.520]   some of them are compatible, some of them are not.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   On my iPad, do I really wanna have
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.360]   five different book reading apps?
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.560]   And some of my books are here and some of them are there.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.160]   That's the frustration with having
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.040]   all these different bookstores.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.360]   And I imagine it'll shake out,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.280]   and either some of them will just die out
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.520]   or the different editions will become more interoperable.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.960]   I know that Google's using Adobe Digital Edition,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.720]   so it's got some compatibility with some of the e-readers.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.680]   And it's early days.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.480]   It's gonna be messy for a while.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.600]   Right now, if I had to choose,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.720]   I actually buy most of my e-books on the Kindle Store.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.320]   One, 'cause I have a Kindle.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.640]   And two, because I think the Kindle app for the iPad
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.040]   is the best of the reader apps.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.200]   Although it's certainly debatable and that iBooks is good.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.680]   And I think the Barnes & Noble app is actually okay too.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.320]   The other thing to keep in mind with these reader apps.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.160]   It's just not that simple.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.000]   - Adam, please take a look at that.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.840]   - Adam, please take a look at that.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.760]   - We're gonna have to go to a commercial
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.880]   for two, one of our fine, fine sponsors
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.120]   that keeps us all so well entertained.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.320]   I'm sure all of you here on the show today
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.120]   enjoyed the buffet and the green room table.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.960]   I hope the sushi is a little bit off,
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.880]   but other than that, the rolls are actually quite excellent.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.440]   So let's go turn over to Leo for a sec with a message from.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.800]   - Go to my PC.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.120]   I do wanna talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.920]   who make a great product called Go to My PC.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.760]   And they really are great pains to let you know
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.520]   that it works on Macs.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.960]   In fact, you could try it free right now for 30 days
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.360]   on your Mac, if you go to go to my PC.com.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.760]   Use the offer code Mac break.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   You can also try it free on Windows.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.560]   It works on both.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.840]   In fact, it's a great way to go across platform.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.280]   I do know people who go to coffee shops,
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.160]   you know, we're hearing about this fire sheep,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.520]   this Firefox plugin that lets people steal your login
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.440]   to Twitter and Facebook and Google and other places,
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   WordPress.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.600]   What a great solution.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.560]   Use Go to My PC.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.880]   Go to that coffee shop.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.320]   Log into your office computer.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.480]   Surf from there, you're 128-bit SSL, absolutely protected.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.800]   That's just one of many ways people are using Go to My PC.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.120]   It's the ideal remote access solution.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.960]   The holidays are coming.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.440]   You wanna go home early.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.840]   Wanna be there for the turkey,
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.200]   but you don't wanna come back to a full mailbox?
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.280]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.600]   If you visit Go to My PC.com/Macbreak,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.920]   you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.480]   Remote access, done easy.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.400]   In fact, so easy that if you go there right now
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.240]   before I'm done talking, you will have that installed.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.960]   It just takes a few seconds.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.920]   Then you go out on the road with your laptop.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   You don't have to have it on the laptop at all.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.680]   Okay, I log on to Go to My PC with my credentials.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.160]   30 seconds later I'm on my office.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.240]   See if you send an email to the boss.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.520]   I would recommend like three in the morning
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.480]   from your corporate email saying,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.680]   "Work a little late, but I'll be in in the morning
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.760]   "seven a.m. as always."
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.680]   It fools them every time
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.720]   'cause bosses don't understand Go to My PC.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.800]   Go to me.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.200]   Unless you're the boss and you do understand it.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.600]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.880]   It is a really great product.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.720]   Give it a try.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.000]   We know you will like it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.840]   We thank Citrix.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.800]   They've been a great supporter of the Twit Network for,
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.600]   I think we're on our third or fourth year with them.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.600]   Leo LaPorte, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.440]   Leo LaPorte.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.920]   So Adam, you had some final words
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.320]   about the Google e-books store, any books in general?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   I was just gonna say that I think the readers,
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.360]   we can all debate little points here and there,
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   but the fact of the matter is
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.200]   there's just not that much to it
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   and they're going to be converging on a certain way of working.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   Maybe there'll be little bits
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.560]   and little bits are different here and there,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   but in a matter of a year or so,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.400]   I can't imagine that there'll be
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   any significant difference in usability.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.920]   Adam, you look so tense right now.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.760]   You look so calm down, man.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   You are an out and natural.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.840]   Logan gets from running.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.200]   Or at least run as high.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.440]   Like after the second commercial,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.000]   we falls over and build a group
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.440]   pulls a table on top of them.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   Wake up, Adam.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.920]   Stay with us, Adam.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.320]   I'm so sorry.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.240]   Other years from last week,
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.280]   Samsung is releasing some sales figures
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.040]   from the release of the Samsung Galaxy Tab,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.640]   a seven-inch table with a very first real iPad competitor.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.760]   And they said that they sold one million
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.440]   in their very first three weeks,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.240]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.840]   Apple was always talking about selling one million
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.520]   at the end of the first month.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.800]   They sold just for,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.840]   just to show off that actually research this.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.360]   Apple has sold 4.19 million iPads in the last quarter,
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.760]   3.27 million iPads in the previous quarter.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.240]   So to be fair to Apple,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.200]   if Samsung is gonna outsell the iPad in 2010,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.280]   they're really gonna have to have
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.920]   a very strong holiday quarter.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.760]   But you know what?
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.600]   That's why there are four quarters in every football game.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.360]   And there's still four weeks left in the holiday season.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.120]   It's, although it does seem to show
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.880]   there's a lot of pent up demand for a seven-inch notebook.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.480]   The other thing I had to remember
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   and made sure I quoted exactly
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.320]   was Steve Jobs during that same analyst call
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.000]   where they announced a 4.19 million iPads sold.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.080]   This is a direct quote.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.920]   "The covered crop of seven-inch tablets
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.600]   "are gonna be DOA dead on arrival.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.640]   "Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.080]   "that their tablets are too small."
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.400]   And that Sonya Heard was the lady in the tank top
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.760]   with the sledgehammer running down the middle of the aisle
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.600]   as he's saying that on a huge screen.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   - It's interesting that the Galaxy tablet
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.840]   is one of those products that I liked way more
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   than I thought I would.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.920]   Even though I'm not a huge Android fan,
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.800]   I liked Android better on the large screen
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.320]   than I did on the smaller ones.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.440]   And I liked the fact that it acted as a book reader
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.200]   much better than I think the iPad does
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   just because I could hold it
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.400]   and I could walk with it and not feel like
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.120]   it was carrying a large device.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.800]   So it's better than I thought it would be,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.080]   which isn't to say it's great.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.160]   It's just not terrible.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.840]   - The lightness is really a good thing about it
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.640]   and it is sort of kindle-like almost.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.680]   Although I don't know if you've tried the Nook Color day
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.040]   of I know that Andy's got one with him right now.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.880]   The Nook Color is also that same kind of form factor
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.040]   and it's an older version of Android
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.160]   and it's been really customized.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.400]   But it points out something
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.280]   which is the Nook Color's price is way cheaper
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.160]   than the Galaxy Tab.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.200]   'Cause the Galaxy Tab is really expensive
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.960]   unless you get it subsidized and do a contract on it.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.640]   I was in an AT&T store the other day
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   and they had the iPad and the AT&T version
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.720]   of the Galaxy Tab next to each other.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.480]   And it's a little device, big device.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.680]   And the Galaxy Tab is like $40 more or something like that.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.240]   I mean, it's not cheap.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   Whereas the Nook Color is more in the ballpark,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   I feel like in terms of price
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.960]   and that nice e-book reader size.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.360]   - Absolutely agreed.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.200]   I don't know why they made the Galaxy Tab cost quite as much
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.040]   as it does.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.960]   Well, I mean, I do know because they can't hit their price
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.280]   targets, but it's outrageously expensive.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.600]   Someone was asking me the other day
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.640]   whether they should get one.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.960]   And the answer from my perspective was absolutely not.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360]   - It cost like an iPod touch.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.840]   - It would be different.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.080]   - Oh yeah, then it would be reasonable
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.200]   or get a Wi-Fi one out that's just not as incredibly costly.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.320]   I also just loved, I went into I think to a Verizon store
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.760]   and I was talking to them about it.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.720]   Nobody knew anything about it at the time.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.160]   And when I finally got someone who did,
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.320]   I know the data plan that you get, it costs $20
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.760]   for the cheapest data plan,
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.960]   but you have to pay an activation fee of $35.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   And you can turn off the data plan,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.560]   but when you turn it back on, you have to pay another $35.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.000]   So Verizon is just the, you know, I know AT&T has a bad rap,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.360]   but boy, Verizon is just awful.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.920]   They don't get it.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.200]   - Plus, as the usual carrier, you carry a mumbo jumbo,
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.640]   we have to pay extra just for the privilege of purchasing it.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   You have to pay certain fees and taxes.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.440]   As soon as you take delivery of it.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   Also the usual Android mumbo jumbo,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.240]   where you look at the specs of this device
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.000]   and you think, okay, so it can use Bluetooth.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   That's wonderful.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.120]   That means that in a pinch,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.160]   I could actually hook up a Bluetooth keyboard to it.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.640]   And not so fast because Verizon of all the carriers
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.400]   decided to turn off that feature
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.920]   'cause it was just too useful.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.080]   Okay, but you still have that wonderful, it's truly.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.920]   And then there's one of the most useful features,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.840]   which is baked right into Android 2.2,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.200]   which is the availability to share
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   the 3G connection and use it as a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.280]   That works great on Verizon.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.320]   But AT&T decided that it doesn't like that feature.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.760]   So it's turned off on the AT&T version of it.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.920]   It's just a mess.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.600]   - Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.800]   I got the T-Mobile one, which has all this stuff turned on.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.440]   But I don't get the incredible Verizon Vcast.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.160]   So I don't know, maybe I just am missing something.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.280]   (laughing)
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.880]   - You're missing out on all those episodes
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.840]   of Curb Your Enthusiasm streamed at 20K bit resolution.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.280]   So what are you gonna do?
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.800]   What are you gonna get?
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.880]   Let's see, we also, there's a really interesting,
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.960]   there's a piece I wanna discuss here.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.720]   I was in Apple Insider in a couple of different online sites
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.320]   last week about the, there are two things that Apple
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.120]   is always this close to doing the deal on.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.680]   One is the Verizon iPhone, the other is subscription based
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.480]   publications in the iBook store.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.200]   And so now there are more reports that there's still
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.000]   - Is computing as fast?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.920]   - Oh, Jason, this is Captain.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.360]   - Jason, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.240]   - Traditional publishing magnet is skeptical.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.720]   Let's hear from Jason.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.560]   - Well, I mean, the story Apple does have,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.160]   and Apple will tell you that they--
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.240]   - I know this would be a great topic.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   I'm such a great host.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.800]   - They have, they have Bravo, Andy.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.920]   When you eliminate one of the guests, don't let it be me.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.000]   The thing about the subscription thing is Apple
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.720]   will tell you they've got a subscription model.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.240]   And the subscription model is this in-app subscription thing
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.960]   where it's not really a subscription,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.760]   and you have to do all the work yourself.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.200]   And they actually said this at a developer conference
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   that they said, "Here's our solution,"
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.240]   which is not a solution.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.160]   And all the magazine publishers say,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.320]   and newspaper publishers say, "Well, no, first off,
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.560]   when somebody signs up for a subscription through iTunes,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.240]   they're an Apple customer.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.840]   You've got the credit card, you've got the name.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   We don't know anything.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.640]   We just have this little receipt."
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.000]   And the publishing industry, publishers like building up
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.160]   a list of names.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.920]   They like to be able to market directly and upsell them
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.440]   and market subscription renewals
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.200]   and rent the lists out to people who spam you with email.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.120]   I mean, there's a whole collection of things
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.200]   that goes into the business of being a publisher.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.480]   And Apple wants to not let the publishers have that.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Apple really wants to control everything
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.360]   about that experience.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.240]   It's very similar to the attitude
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.760]   about why you have to leave the Amazon app,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.120]   or the Kindle app on your iPhone or iPad in order to buy a book.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.200]   It's because Apple doesn't let anybody buy things in an app
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.680]   unless Apple controls the entire process.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.880]   So, you know, it's interesting that Apple
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.040]   is apparently talking to them.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.160]   I'm not entirely convinced that the conversation isn't,
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.560]   we offer this program, you should use it,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.840]   no, we're not gonna do that,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.240]   but we offer this program, no, we're not gonna do that.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.560]   I don't know if it's more than that going on there,
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.040]   but I know as a part of a publishing company,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.600]   Apple's terms are really not that great
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.240]   because they control the entire customer
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.600]   and your readers are no longer your customers,
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.040]   your readers are Apple's customers.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.080]   And businesses are really reluctant to go down that path
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.360]   and give away that much control plus 30% to somebody like Apple.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.680]   - Yeah, I wanna just jump in there.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   It's the same thing. - It's the same thing.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.720]   - Any voices. - I want you to go first
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.560]   than Dave.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.120]   - I was gonna say that we don't run into this so much
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.440]   on the tidbit side of the house for us
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.480]   because tidbits is free, so when we don't do that much
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   in a way of advertising, but on the book side,
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.080]   when it's take control, it is absolutely essential
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.640]   to our entire business model that we be able to get to people
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.320]   because we want to maintain that relationship.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.120]   We want to be able to give these people updates.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.080]   We want to be able to tell them when something new
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.160]   is coming out. - Totally.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.360]   - And if we can't do that, then we're dead in the water.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.640]   And so there's ways around it and we've built
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.560]   sort of things into our book so people can buy a book
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.760]   on the iBook store and then sign up for an account
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.840]   with us so that we'll be able to give them updates
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.040]   and whatnot, but we can't ask people to do that.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.680]   We don't know if they'll actually click that link
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.360]   and sign up for the account, whereas any book they buy from us
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.640]   guaranteed account.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.720]   So that's a really big deal for a lot of businesses
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.640]   where being able to interact with your customers is huge.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.120]   And honestly, I'm a little surprised that developers
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.880]   haven't run into the same thing because it would seem to me
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.240]   if you were an iPad or iPhone developer and you'd sold
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.320]   hundreds of thousands of copies, you'd want to be able
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.920]   to get back to them in some way, shape or form,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.000]   rather than just via an update that they might download
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and not see anything.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.840]   I mean, maybe you can build little splash screens
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.640]   and say, hey, you know that you've got the update,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.680]   come talk to us again.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   But it feels very disconnected and Apple maybe can get away
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.200]   with it when they're the only store, but if you have
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.560]   a situation where there's a bookstore or with magazine
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.840]   subscriptions, people are going to go a different place
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.520]   where they can maintain that relationship with our customers.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.560]   Well, most of the magazine and newspaper industry too,
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.400]   you know, they exist.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.040]   I know that the apps or developers obviously do feel this way.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.520]   They do want to have a better connection with their customers.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.800]   With the differences with a newspaper or a magazine,
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.680]   you're starting out with an existing database system
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.120]   that monitors all your subscribers and, you know,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.280]   they've got this whole existing relationship
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.400]   with their subscribers and that makes them much more
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.880]   reluctant to give that up or to create some strange
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.000]   kind of parallel system.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.680]   And then do I transfer people over into Apple's pool
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.440]   and it just gets much more complicated.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.800]   But I think you do hear that from iOS developers in general
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.920]   that they're frustrated that they don't really know
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.040]   who their customers are.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.080]   And sometimes they go through great lengths to get them to,
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.520]   you know, sign up or give them some information
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.680]   just so that they can have some sort of a relationship
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.400]   or they start sending messages in the app.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.960]   That happens too.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   Yeah, this is a recurring theme in the iOS app store.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.800]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.240]   It is a concern on tender hooks for the past five minutes.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.000]   But let's go ahead.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I was going to say this is, in fact,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.400]   an existing concern in the iOS app store.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.280]   It is a recurring concern in the iOS app store.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.080]   It's a very clearly and publicly stated concern
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   by established Mac developers who want to be in the Mac app store
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.920]   that by being in any Apple app store,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.400]   you give up control of that customer relationship.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.080]   You don't know who your customer is and Apple does.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.280]   And there's no way for you to find out, really.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:34.360]   And in fact, doing anything in app to collect any information
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.120]   on who your customers are is against the guidelines.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:44.200]   So you're kind of stuck until Apple comes around
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.960]   and because they don't want you taking their sale away from them.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.640]   There's lots of stuff in the app store guidelines
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.320]   and the app store rules that revolves around that.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.440]   So yeah, it's not, by any means,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.040]   unique to the sale of books or other media or subscriptions.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.280]   It's just something that the app store does not provide.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:12.080]   We're trans by the bird.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.920]   Go ahead, Dave.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.920]   Sorry.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.920]   I was just going to say that that rich just basically
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.240]   made the point I was going to make is that this is what I've been complaining about
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:25.480]   about both the app store on the iPhone and the iPad and the new Mac app store.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.280]   It really, you're paying Apple 30%,
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.120]   not just to complete the transaction for you,
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.160]   but you're actually paying them to take away
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.720]   one of your most valuable assets,
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.280]   namely your customer list.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.080]   And obviously, this hurts publishers.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.000]   And it's interesting now to see that as writers
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.680]   and people who work for magazines who may push the benefits of the app stores
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.680]   as from a user's perspective,
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.560]   they're now sort of seeing it from the side of the application developer,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.360]   where you're seeing that you're completely screwed
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.160]   when you get disconnected from the customer list.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.920]   Oh, the shoe is on the other foot now.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.760]   It really is.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.640]   It's really interesting.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.960]   And it's a terrible thing.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.200]   You're going to try to manage this.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   But no, there's another part to it, which is that,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.080]   I mean, the Wall Street Journal manages this.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.320]   And I know they're building their own system to do it.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.000]   But well before Apple provided that,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.400]   the Wall Street Journal used sign up,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   you get a subscription, the subscriptions with them,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.200]   and they're their application and downloads new issues automatically.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.680]   So yeah, you do have to build it yourself.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.520]   But it can't be done.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.760]   Yeah, it can't be done if you want to.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   At least from a public perspective, we can't do it.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.480]   It's after the purpose. Go ahead.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.440]   Is Apple being a jerk about this?
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.160]   Why are they sticking to their guns like this?
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.120]   Is this just corporate policy or is they really have a purpose behind this?
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   Is it a user feature?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.480]   It's unknowable because there's so much opacity.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.720]   And honestly, Apple's a business.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.800]   And speaking from my seat as a businessman,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.400]   they're not obligated to explain or justify the inner workings of their business.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.040]   Their position seems to be that, at least for now,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.120]   if you don't like it, you don't have to do it.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.040]   So anything that we come up with is going to be the purest form of speculation.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:18.280]   We know that they like to control all possible aspects of the user experience.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.320]   And they've extended that to the App Store.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   And that's probably just another manifestation of that.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:31.800]   We know that they don't want developers bypassing the App Store
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.880]   to resell their products outside of it,
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.760]   at least when it comes to the iOS App Store.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.600]   I think that's what it's about, too.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.080]   I think it's this consistency issue where Apple is afraid to let the genie out of the bottle
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.760]   in terms of letting apps charge credit cards through some mechanism
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.000]   that isn't your Apple ID through Apple,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.360]   because they're worried about what might happen if that happens
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.520]   and people getting scammed by apps.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.840]   And Apple losing the 30% cut as well is probably part of it.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.600]   But this is the thing, is that publishers want to be able to do that.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.040]   And Apple doesn't want to do that.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.000]   And publishers, we're at a bit of an impasse here.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.400]   And the other part of it is the Apple ID is tantalizing for everybody,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.320]   including publishers, because it's so easy to buy things with your iTunes password,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.000]   instead of having to go out to a website and put in your credit card information.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.040]   And so there's also that balance of like,
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.400]   "Well, I don't really want to give Apple my information,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.280]   but it makes it so easy for people to buy my stuff if I do use Apple system."
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.240]   So Apple's afraid of letting the genie out of the bottle,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.040]   but they also know they've got a really tantalizing product here,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.120]   which Steve Jobs has boasted about on stage,
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.320]   which is how many credit cards they have in the iTunes system.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.960]   And that's, you know, it's, boy, it's really easy to make a purchase,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.880]   when all you have to do is ask for an iTunes password.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.240]   Why did they let the Wall Street Journal do it, Jason?
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.000]   Well, they did. You are entering here.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.120]   No, well, I think the way it's supposed to work is you're supposed to go to a web view
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.000]   and do it in the web view.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.960]   But the Wall Street Journal is a little bit different.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.880]   I know when we're building an iPad app that hopefully will be out very soon,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.560]   and you can either do an in-app purchase or you can go to our website.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.200]   And it's problematic because you don't want to make the,
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.280]   you'd be on the wrong side of Apple's guidelines there.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.320]   But the journal is, Journal is right at the edge.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.760]   And I think that what happened is that somebody at Apple probably high up said,
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.280]   "No, that's good enough. Let's let them try it."
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.560]   But the rule is supposed to be, it can't happen in the app itself.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.760]   It has to happen in a web view.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.600]   Yeah, that's why I was kind of surprised when I saw the way that they did it.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.840]   And it's a decent experience, actually.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.600]   It's probably the best way to read the journal right now,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.840]   except that it costs more than the paper version.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.880]   And if you buy the paper version, you get the iPad version for free.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.120]   So I haven't quite figured that part out yet.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.240]   Oh, if you subscribe to the paper version, you also get a free hat.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   So it's definitely complicated decision.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.080]   Let's not overlook that.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.160]   The other news from Apple last week,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.280]   information about the upcoming Mac OS App Store is coming out in Dribs and Dribs.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.760]   There was another thing from Apple last week saying that,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.800]   "officially, you are actively discouraged in the form of not being able to do it
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.040]   as a developer, release demos and limited functionality and betas
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.920]   through the Mac OS App Store."
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   And it's so hard to evaluate these sort of things,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.400]   because from a user level, it sort of makes sense that I don't necessarily want to have
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.800]   this really big, beautiful store from cluttered up with stuff that may or may not
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.520]   actually work.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.640]   Other things, what are the brown trouser moments that
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.520]   developers are kind of having about the possibility of the App Store so far?
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.760]   Well, at the risk of speaking out of school,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.800]   I feel I must say that the recently broken news about the App Store guidelines
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.080]   isn't actually new.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   That particular guideline, along with many others, was expressed
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.400]   when the App Store first rolled out to developers.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.800]   No demos, that's a problem.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:11.600]   It would really be great if it were possible to do demos with in-app purchase,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.920]   and right now, it really isn't.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.720]   Ship what you sell, you sell what you ship.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:23.600]   On the other hand, we are used to doing a demo version, and if folks want a demo version,
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.160]   they can go to our website and pick one up.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.320]   There's no problem with that, and when they're ready to buy, they can buy from the App Store
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.400]   if that's what they would prefer to do.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   There's some exploration with some developers I've spoken with
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:47.760]   into shipping light versions of their apps, or free versions of their apps that don't do as
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.040]   much as the paid one, so that's one possibility.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.400]   Beta is understandable too.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.160]   You want to ship what you're shipping, not something that's not ready yet.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.680]   So I think some of it's just a formalization of common sense.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.720]   The only real issue is the absence of demos, though.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.520]   How's this going to affect you?
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.640]   Your company's big product is super duper.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.120]   My favorite backup utility for the Mac or probably any other operating system out there,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.920]   but you have sort of an interesting, well-deserved, you've saved my heart.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.080]   You've saved my data at least once, and for that,
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.880]   the content of pizza is going to be sent your way, even when your second death of pizza is bought for you.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.040]   The thing is, you have a more different relationship with your users,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.120]   because most of the time you've got that constant stream of people emailing you and saying,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:43.840]   "I use your application, and I try to back up my internal hard drive onto my thumb drive that I
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:49.440]   got at the supermarket, but it stopped after 30 seconds, and I want to know how you're going to fix that."
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.600]   So can you really do business through an App Store model, given that you've got this really
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:59.440]   special utility? Yeah, it's an interesting problem, because we do have a very close relationship to
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.760]   users. A gigantic amount of my time has spent helping people and coaching them. They're not so
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.640]   much with their supermarket thumb drive. But when someone contacts us, they're typically at a
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.680]   moment of crisis, whether they have just lost their data or they're planning on losing their data soon.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.600]   It's just good office automation. You schedule things. That way they don't take you by surprise.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.400]   Absolutely. I'm going to drop my iPhone in the toilet.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.000]   The App Store actually won't allow something like Superduper in, because
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.680]   Run has to have root access. By root access, I mean access to all of the files on your system,
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.080]   and you can't have access to all the files on your system if you're in the App Store. So no matter
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:48.640]   what, I can't put Superduper in the App Store. But even if I could, the problem is that giving
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:56.640]   Apple 30% really cuts into our profits so much that it becomes incredibly difficult to even support
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:03.040]   our users in any effective way. It built into the price of Superduper is the cost of providing a
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.760]   lot of support to users, which we do. So it's a weird and difficult problem.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.880]   Well, we've got to take a break for another one of these people who keeps the juices flowing and
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:20.800]   the three buffet online. So let's go back over to Leo Le Porte to tell us a little bit about our
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.440]   friends at Squarespace. Squarespace.com. It's a secret behind exceptional websites. As long as
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:34.000]   you're typing in URLs, type in squarespace.com. You can start your own site right now for free.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.160]   Just go to squarespace.com/macbreak and click the green "try it for free" button. All you have to do
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.240]   is give it a site name, a password, an email address for recovering the password and then in the
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.040]   capture. And you've got a site. Now you can start playing with it. And I'll tell you the template,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:55.680]   60 plus designer templates. But that's just the starting point because as you design your Squarespace
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:02.960]   blog, the Ajax interface that allows you to modify the template makes it so easy. You just drag margins
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:08.720]   around, click on this, click on that. Every site looks different without any use of CSS or JavaScript.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.760]   Of course, if you're a CSS junkie or JavaScript hacker, you can do anything because it's completely
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.600]   compatible to that as well. So you have full control, but you don't need to have those skills
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.960]   to make a site that looks like a pro. One of the neat things is that it's all Java-based and they
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.200]   use a very sophisticated Java virtual server technology that guarantees you the bandwidth.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.160]   You never have to worry about your site. It's just it's robust, reliable as can be.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.280]   Now you're for hosting and the software $12 a month, you can save 10% if you use the offer code
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.040]   Mac break. That's not just for the first month or first year, but for the life of your site.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.840]   There are more features for more money. You see what you need. You can upgrade at any time.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.720]   But do use the offer code Mac break so you save that money. Squarespace.com, the secret
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.560]   behind exceptional websites. Thank you very much. Leo support.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   Man, a plan, a canal, Panama. We're going to get to our picks shortly, but first there's a
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.040]   question that I really think I really want to hear all of you guys talk about. And that's the
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:17.360]   question of the next really big, really cool version of the Mac OS, because we're seeing Google
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   really make a lot of moves into trying to blur the lines between what should be mobile, what should
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:27.120]   be desktop, what is the business of Google.com. Every single different company is trying to
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.440]   get new approaches. And we're still looking at an operating system that in many ways is not
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:38.080]   that different from what we had in 10.0. And obviously we've already seen preview of Lion coming up.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.560]   But what about the next step after Lion? What are we going to be seeing after that? Is Apple
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.640]   going to go for a Mac OS 10.8? Or is it time to really get committed and start working on 11.0?
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.440]   So that's so different from 10.0 is different from 10.0 is 10.0 was from from 9.2. I mean,
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.760]   putting a lot of capital into all the mobile devices, you're going to have to start
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.640]   really changing things up is a lot of time. I think if you read the tea leaves, Andy,
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.000]   you can see pretty clearly that the next version of OS 10 is just going to be iTunes.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.560]   And iTunes is the operating system. It'll be great. It's just like the web being the operating
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:21.360]   system. Shuffle clip your hands. I don't think it's ever going to happen. I think OS 10 is going
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.600]   to be the brand name for the Mac OS until there's no Mac anymore. I know that maybe that's a bold
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.800]   prediction, but I feel like there's a lot of room left in OS 10. I think we might even see an OS
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:38.400]   10 version 11.0, but still call it OS 10. So you're suggesting a version of a software development
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:44.160]   version of Xenos Paradox where we become closer and closer to 11.0 without actually ever getting
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.080]   to move. No, I think we'll get to 11.0 and it'll be Mac OS X 11.0 and they'll just keep on rolling.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:56.000]   Or there'll be 10.10 and that will really freak people out. But I do think that people know that
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.120]   name and that name is out there. And until there comes some day in the future where there's only one
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   Apple OS and it runs everything in different modes, which might happen. But it'd be a long time from
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:13.760]   now. I just don't. I think OS 10 is Apple's got just enough focus on OS 10 to move it forward
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:19.680]   slowly over the years. I don't think rebranding and remarketing it is ever going to happen.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.360]   I actually think what they're going to do is drop version numbers entirely.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   That I mean, look at what they did with with Lion. They didn't say Mac OS 10, 10.7 Lion. They just
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:38.320]   said Mac OS 10 Lion. So, you know, we are getting all sorts of when our customer service, you know,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.560]   and people asking, you know, what books we have about different things. People are confused about
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.320]   what 10.3 is, 10.4 is, 10.5 is. And, you know, honestly, once you get enough of those, the big cat
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.960]   names are probably easier to remember. So, that may be the way they avoid having to rebrand Mac OS
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.120]   10. They just go for more big cats. Although at some point they'll run out of big cats too.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.400]   Only the geeky people are going to have the cognitive dissonance of saying, well, but this
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.200]   is 10.9 and then 10.10. That's impossible because it's a decimal system and that would be 10.1.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.440]   And, you know, but the regular users, I think Adam is right. One of the brilliant things about
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.240]   marketing your operating system without a number is that, you know, not having a number means you
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.160]   never have to say you're sorry. You can just keep on iterating for the geeks in the background.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.960]   And in the foreground, they're just saying, you know, it's also a lot. Yay.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:32.560]   We're happy. This is part of our DNA. Apple would not be successful for whatever,
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.720]   for our ability to detach ourselves from our ability to rationally process the things that
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.200]   we do. That's why we've got a show. Exactly. Thank you very much. I mean, for saying that. I didn't
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.160]   want to say that out right. But now, but apples in a position today that they weren't in when they
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.920]   were setting out to develop 2.0, they almost had nothing to lose by saying that we're going to build
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.240]   a brand new operating system that is completely compatible with everything we've done before.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.080]   You'll have to buy at some point all new apps at some point, a lot of your hardware is going to
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   stop working because otherwise they're going to be out of business. I mean, are they in a position
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.560]   now where they it's almost right now they can't revolutionize. They can't simply say, we're going
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.800]   to do something so different with the next version of the operating system that it has to be done in
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:18.000]   order to keep us our operating system competitive. But a lot of you are going to have to bleed
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.160]   really, really heavy before the bleeding stops. Oh, sure. They can totally do that. And
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:33.600]   as far as branding goes, my guess is they'll drop the X at some point. It'll just be Mac OS.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:42.480]   That solves the cognitive dissonance of calling it Mac OS X version 11. They could conceivably
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:48.400]   someday even drop the Mac part of it and just call it iOS because iMac has an i in it too, right?
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:58.560]   Odds are, I predict they drop the X. But yeah, I mean, they can certainly radically retool and
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:06.640]   rethink the OS they did at once. They did it from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS 10. They've done it in a more
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:12.240]   incremental sort of inside-to-out fashion over the evolution of Mac OS 10. Certainly,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:21.120]   Snow Leopard today is radically different from the 10.0 or the 10.1 that first really gained traction.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:30.800]   So will it happen all at once? Possibly. I think what we'll see is, you know, someday the internals
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:37.360]   will have evolved and the visible parts will just one day undergo some radical change.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:43.760]   I just think it's going to become less important. I mean, we will just start seeing more and more
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:50.640]   iOS devices that are starting to move into other segments. And slowly OS 10 will marginalize itself
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.280]   the way the Mac Pro has, for example. It'll be for certain customers, but not for most.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:01.680]   And no one will care that it's called OS 10. Sorry, I didn't mean to diss your Mac Pro.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.200]   And I also think that the whole cognitive dissonance thing is just going to be
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:11.600]   Twitter kicking up a storm for a week and it'll stop. We're just going to have to feel like crazy
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.520]   for that week. It'll be like all the complaining about the branding of the Mac book.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.840]   We might have Apple might for the first time in three months actually outpopulate Justin Bieber
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.760]   in the Twitter rankings right now. Okay, we're going to be coming right back with our picks.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.400]   Everybody have your picks lined up and ready to go. Before that, we're going to have another
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.040]   ad from a sponsor from our good, good, close personal friends. Ad honorable.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:47.120]   Live live ad game. You see, I've actually got the thing that I have to actually read, although
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.520]   much of this comes from the heart because if we're not for audible, there's so many books that I
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:57.440]   would not be reading and so many fossil fuels I would not be expending and amortizing the lives
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.080]   of our children and our children's children, our children's children's children, just so that I
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.000]   can finish the next chapter of this mother's brothers book before sort of actually heading home.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:13.360]   Essentially, remember that every single book, so many books you might want to see,
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.560]   fiction, nonfiction, poetry, high flute and stuff, low flute and stuff. Interestingly,
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:24.160]   paid people are going to be talking about it and reading it to you aloud. And in Tonya's voices,
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:29.200]   in the full versions and the edited versions, it's all up to you. Audible, they have tens of
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.720]   thousands of books, 75,000 in their library right now. For those of you who like myself,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.280]   live alone, it's you like audible because it's kind of like you have a friend with you in the house
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:46.880]   speaking to you and saying, assuring things, staving off the coldness of a lonely, lonely,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.560]   lonely existence. For those of you with families in the house, it gives you that sort of brief
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.360]   respite from people who are always honking down your snorkel about one thing or another,
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:59.680]   because the narrator of your latest book doesn't judge you, doesn't really think that you're an
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.120]   awful person for having parked the car on the wrong side of the driveway. They just want you
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:10.480]   to be informed and entertained. There's a special deal for everybody who is listening to Mac Break,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:18.720]   even download a free book by going to audible.com/macbreak to download anyone of Audible, 75,000
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:24.560]   different titles. And even if you cancel it, that book is yours to keep. Normally, I do a pick of
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.360]   the week, but we have a special guest picker here in the form of Rich Rich. You've been reading
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:34.560]   something extremely exciting and wonderful that I hardly approve of. And now I want to know what
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.920]   you think about that book. What is that book? Okay, the book is called The Coke Machine. It's
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:46.160]   written by Michael Blanding. And it's very interesting. It's a history of Coca-Cola from really the
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:52.080]   very beginning through modern times. And he shines a fairly unflinching light on their business
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:59.600]   practices, their marketing practices, how they produce their product. It's very interesting,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.640]   very enlightening, very entertaining, only about a third of the way through. But I highly
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.400]   endorse this product and our service. And yes, it is available on audible.com.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:16.000]   Yes, Coca-Cola is an official sponsor of Mac Break Weekly. Coca-Cola is not, but suffice
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   to say that at least my participation would not be quite so energetic or discordant, if not for
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.280]   the fine products of the Coca-Cola company. But somebody get out of my Coke.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:34.560]   Oh, yeah, just to wake him up. Somebody get that sounds true of quarter turn.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:41.920]   That's my that's my that's my poison. All right. You see, you see, if you didn't spend so much time
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   running, you'd still have energy for these sitting up things because the rest of us have
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.440]   been most of our day just sitting in front sitting in comfortable chairs, sitting forward. We have
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.640]   the endurance necessary for long periods of sitting. Your body's a temple out and you can't really
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.800]   just let it fall. Try to do one of these podcasts while you're running. I dare you.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.240]   You know, I actually think we need any to wireless 3G. Actually, I couldn't have to
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.600]   wire us. It could just be a video camera that I could, you know, stop on my head in some
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.560]   point. I think a whole man person cross country running is the next big TV sport.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   It'd be like Al Franken's mobile satellite uplink that he used to have on Saturday Night Live.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:26.960]   This is the greatest thing. The sponsor message ever. Exactly. We give value for money. Once again,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:34.480]   audible.com/macbreak to get your free book. And now we move on to our picks of the week in which we
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   salute the wild, the wacky, the wonderful, our equivalent of the video of the sports enthusiast
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.920]   in the outfield who gets hit by an errant ground ball only with software and hardware.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.160]   Let's start off with Jason. I think for no other apparent reason than Jay starts with a letter J.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   Thank you, Andy. My pick this week is a Twitter app. And I know what you're saying. It's like,
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   I might even on the Twitter. But if you were on the Twitter friends, wait, this is something
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.960]   like a sponsorship message now. No, I'm a big Twitterific. If you're going to sponsor it,
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.520]   use the sponsor message. You know, folks, there are a lot of Twitter apps out there. But
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.840]   only this Twitter app has these smooth mellow menthol taste that doctors recommend.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:23.440]   So I'm a big Twitterific fan, but Twitterific on the desktop is a little bit old and there's a
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.400]   new version coming, but it's not here. And I try all these Twitter apps. And it's very rare that I
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:33.040]   get one that I keep for any length of time and keep using. And the one that I've actually been
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:39.520]   using for the last couple of months is Hibari. You can get it at hibariapp.com. It's $14, I think,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.800]   and there's, I think it's a 30 day trial. Really nice, nice, simple, straightforward app.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.040]   And one of the features that I've been using lately, they added this really super geeky feature
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.320]   where you can edit the CSS basically of the app and change it into any color scheme you want. So
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:00.160]   I've actually got it replicating my old beloved Twitterific color scheme. And now, now I'm using
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:07.120]   that. So, so Hibari from a viral at Viola song is the author of of Hibari. And you can get it
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.040]   at hibariapp.com. It's only about 14 bucks. I like it because it looks just like a very,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.360]   very plain as in its default skin. It looks like a very plain window. I mean, I'm still using the
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:22.080]   the web app only because I really don't want people to I don't I don't want a developer to think that
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.160]   I'm living leaving a Twitter lifestyle in which I'm here 12 hours a day managing Twitter. Oh, yeah,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.160]   that I mean, that's my big problem with tweet deck as an example is the tweet deck is for power users
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.840]   and everybody and you fill your screen with Twitter and it's like, I don't want Twitter to me and
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.360]   I'm a big Twitter user is not something you fill your screen with. It's something you got kind of
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   on the side and you check in every now and then and Hibari is good at that. It's simple. It's got,
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.320]   you know, it's missing some features that don't really bother me that much that it's missing and
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.080]   it's got the features that I really want. It does native retweeting. It does conversation
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.960]   threading so you can look back through a message. And so for now, that's my that's my pick and 14
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:02.320]   bucks. You know, it was worth it for me. You know, just just because I buy lots of software, but yeah,
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.120]   it's good. I use Twitter enough that I've settled for Hibari now, which is a big thing for me because
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.400]   a lot of these Twitter apps, I try them out and they they're still on my hard drive and I never use
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.720]   them. Yes, I think that now 20% of my disk space is a Twitter app that everybody awesomely thought
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:22.000]   was wonderful. But I thought, okay, it's so let's be retweeted then. Okay, interesting and innovative.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.120]   Adam, your pick of the week. My pick of the week is the the the
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.680]   TATRO case. Here, let's get into the camera here. It's an iPhone case for the iPhone 4,
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:41.600]   a little shell case backwards. And what's cool about it is in the back here, it has this little
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:49.200]   goddamn can't get into the picture. And I damn the I bet. I damn the
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.400]   and so you can see it turns into a stand and it rotates so that you can have it in either
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   landscape or portrait mode. Man, I totally can I handle this backwards and left right thing.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.200]   So it's it's, you know, fold flat fits in your pocket case stand when you need it. And there is
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:19.360]   also a big one for the iPad. So you can you can have exactly the same thing for your iPad. And
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   I as it it's it's just a nice way to do it. I find that I don't like I like the idea of stands,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.480]   but I never have one when I want one. And so building the stand into the case is well,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.240]   frankly, for me about the only reason to use a case because I don't much like cases either. I
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   like the apples industrial design. I don't like to to fuss them up. But if the case can stay out of
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:47.440]   the way and give me a stand, that's a good thing. They're from zero chroma. And you know,
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.880]   write out pretty much new new things right now. Okay, now see what we're doing here is though,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.600]   this is like this is like the cliff the cliffhanger game and prices, right? We're sending a little
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.400]   climber up and up and up up that little up that little incline. Adam, how much is that case again?
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:11.920]   The iPhone one, I believe is $44.95 and the iPad one is I think 59.95.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:17.200]   Okay, so we've gone for $14 to $59. Dave, would you like to share with us?
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.680]   You're your your your favorite item today. I yeah, I had two different items and I'll do
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.000]   two just because one is much more expensive. But as one of them, this is not an iPhone thing,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.200]   but it's kind of iPhone interesting. This is called the Garmin Edge 800. It's a cycling
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.240]   computer that has a touchscreen. And what's especially cool about this is I've got a a
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.720]   cycling glove on here just to show this is not a cycling glove that will work with an iPhone.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.040]   It's just a regular glove. But you'll notice that even though this is a one of those normal
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:56.000]   touch screens, I can actually use it with it with the glove on. Now that's important when you're
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.520]   actually when you're actually cycling because you when you're wearing clubs, you need to be able
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.600]   to actually control the computer. And so you can very easily access all this stuff. And it's still
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.160]   a capacitive screen. But they obviously have integrated some sort of pressure sensitive layer
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.960]   that works really well. So that's the Garmin Edge 800. It's a great cycling computer that does
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.600]   cadence and heart rates and everything else that you need to do. It does matter when your hands are
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:24.240]   so sweaty. It does work when your hands are sweaty. It's completely sealed against against
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.280]   the weather. So it works in the in the rain and everything else. It works in mud. It works in
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.080]   pretty much everything. It's an excellent device. The Garmin Edge 800. It's really good. And the
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.040]   second thing, which I can't show you, but I'll show you to you on the iPhone, is something called
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:49.520]   the Q the clock to, which is a spelled funny. It's Q-L-O-C-K-W-O. And this is a for the person who likes
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:57.360]   time and has $1,200 to spend. This is an awesome wall clock that shows the time in words. So let
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:05.600]   me show it to you on the iPhone. So if you can see here, um, see how it says it is 10 past four.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.840]   So it lights up and these words change as the time goes on. And it's really art for your wall
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.760]   that tells the time. This is a German product that costs about, well, it's 99 cents on the iPhone,
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.480]   but it costs about $1,200 for something for the wall. So this is if you've got a whole bunch of
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.280]   spare change just hanging out there, hidden under your mattress. Did you say for people who like time?
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.680]   That's that is the strangest situation I've ever I despise time.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.600]   Our planet is taking around the sun.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:43.680]   If you like, if you like the display of time and the artful display of time, it's
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:49.200]   it's a different problem. I'm looking at it on the side right now.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.440]   Yeah, it does it does look like let's see if we can let's see if I can get this shot of it
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.640]   here on the on the notebook here. Yes, it is a wall hanging that looks like a kind of like a huge
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.120]   that looks kind of like a huge I don't like a huge expensive thing that none of your friends will
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.560]   understand why you paid 1200 bucks for it looks really it is it is it is hangable art. It looks
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.600]   really really cool. I just not sure that Wow 1200 it looks like a giant like word search puzzle
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:23.360]   where you find what what the time is. So how big is that? It's a beautiful it's a beautiful
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.080]   thing and it will appeal to people who like Apple industrial design to it won the red. award,
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.920]   which is a very well known award and it's it's very nice. So so to go from the the edge, which is a
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:41.840]   typical cycle computer kind of cost of $400 or so to the ridiculously expensive clock. But if you
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:49.200]   just like the idea, you can spend a dollar for it and get it on your iPhone. Okay, so $14.59
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:59.200]   about $1,500. And now I open the floor to Rich Segal. My my two picks and I'm sorry I do have
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:05.440]   two so I'll make them quick actually go together like peanut butter and jelly. The first is the
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:12.640]   model 2010 Mac Pro I recently took delivery of of one and I had it custom built to order with a
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:21.440]   six core 3.33 gigahertz CPU. And you know, it's the one socket motherboard. So it's only got four
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:28.400]   SIM sockets big deal you put you know, four gig SIMs in it, you have a lot of memory. This
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:36.000]   this machine is the sleeper performance hit of the line. It is squarely in the fat part of the price
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.040]   performance curve. It's the fastest Mac Pro I've ever had the pleasure of using. And it has made
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:50.240]   me unbelievably productive. You know, my software builds take place in about a minute now. So
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:58.160]   I'm very happy with this with this gear and I highly recommend it as an upgrade to the from
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:06.080]   the four core configuration or as an alternative to the eight core. My other pick is new today. It
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   is the new version the new expansion of world of Warcraft. It just went live this morning. So I've
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.840]   only spent just the barest minimum of time with it. But if you're into gaming at all and if you've
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:26.960]   played Warcraft at all the the changes are pretty enormous. The game client changes are huge and
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.200]   it's it's been a lot of fun so far. So I recommend one and the other together. You're going to want
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.960]   to make the most of this game and the way to do it is with this this computer.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:43.440]   Yeah, there's so many there's so few people now that really can make the case that it's worth
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:50.800]   buying a Mac Pro. So software developers that's definitely one of them. I would say so. Okay.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.560]   Software developers and gamers. Now you have to ask the cost. Yes.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.960]   How much was that machine? Let me look it up.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:07.760]   But what's platinum going for these days? Because you did ask for that case upgrade.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:16.000]   Yeah. Count the round modules. Okay. So the lever lobes and be sure to buy the ram on Apple.com
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.400]   because it's extra expensive if you do that. That's how other people are doing well.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.160]   It cost me two kidneys. Fortunately, neither one was mine.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.880]   Oh, the.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.120]   You know that FedEx will actually send drivers right to your house like you don't know them.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.200]   They don't know you. It's wonderful if you need organs.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:44.080]   The the the configuration of the 333 six core is 3699 retail and I actually went after market for
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:51.680]   my ram bought it from data memory systems. Nice outfit and that was 325 bucks for 12 giga memory.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.360]   So did you include an SSD in that rich? I did not.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.960]   That's one of the things I've heard also can make a huge difference in performances when you
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:09.120]   had an SSD. It is true. SSDs don't make the don't make the price performance test for me personally.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:17.520]   Rotating storage has done the job. But yeah, you know, if I want to get to terabyte SSD as your name on it.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:27.120]   It says my bank's name on it. Just sign it over. You could buy giant clock that displays the time
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   in words with that kind of money. There you go. That's crazy. And in the world of Warcraft,
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:40.640]   I think it's a 3999 or 4999 one of the two. I just I just figured out a way you could even
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.520]   make it more special. Like no, don't just be satisfied with solid state memory. It's all
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.320]   state storage. Like get now, not just the one terabyte of solid state storage, but get one of
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.000]   those like Dyson like wave fans for the ventilation. So have a solid state fan as well. And those go
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.640]   through well, a thousand bucks like per fan. So you could easily you could easily make this
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.120]   cost almost as much as an original Macintosh portable if you really put your mind to it.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.440]   If I probably worry about as much too.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.120]   And yes, my current world of Warcraft is 3999. Actually, that could be even more expensive
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.080]   world of Warcraft if you factor in loss productivity. So totally. So you so rich,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.040]   you definitely win the prize this week for most expensive pick. You're not almost in Alex
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.680]   Lindsey territory with that. That's that's not an easy thing to pull off. My own pick is
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.920]   kind of a surprise for me. It is the Barnes and Noble Nook reader, which I'm sorry, rather
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.600]   the Nook color, which I just got a hold of last week's been out for a few weeks now. And
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:54.400]   Barnes and Noble really kicked it in for this one that used to the Nook the original Nook was
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.720]   sort of an also ran book reader where it's looked a little bit like a Kindle. It was priced kind
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.320]   of like a Kindle only wasn't as useful as a Kindle. And so my attitude was always, well,
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.720]   okay, what's the point? I mean, why not just get the better selection smaller device and why I mean,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.720]   why are you in the market? Well, this is the reason why it looks like they're in the market.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:22.000]   They came out with this really nice slim seven inch tablet that is it runs Android. You wouldn't
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.040]   know that because obviously it was designed as a book reader. And so well, let's talk about it
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.120]   as a book reader. Yes, it connects to the Barnes and Noble store. It has hundreds of thousands of
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.320]   titles. Okay, that's very nice. They've added a couple of extra special enhancements based on
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.240]   the fact that Barnes and Noble does have one of these real space, meet space, retail establishments.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.040]   And if you go inside, if you use this inside a actual Barnes and Noble physical store,
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.840]   they will let you read pretty much every single book they've got in the electronic library for an
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.320]   hour unrestricted. Because it just simply realized you walk in if the Wi-Fi on this device has
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.680]   already turned on. It says, Oh, I see you're at the National New Hampshire,
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:05.120]   Roskate, mall, Barnes and Noble. Here's here's here's the AT&T wireless service. Here's
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.160]   special promotions. Here's this. Here's that. And it just plain works. But it is basically,
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.040]   it's kind of kind of shove that out of your mind for now. Think of it as a really cool touch
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:21.840]   seven inch touchscreen tablet for $249 with Wi-Fi. Because if you never use the book reading
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.400]   features, and you really should, because it is an ePub based reader, it'll read any ePub book.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:33.680]   It'll also read any Google e-book store book because it uses Adobe DRM. But if you leave that
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:39.280]   aside, it also has an extras tray. So you connect it can also play Pandora radio streaming media.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.720]   It can play MP3s. It can play video. It also has built in document readers that will handle just
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.200]   about every Microsoft Office document and PDF, PowerPoint, everything in there all at once.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.840]   Now, the doubly interesting thing is that I'm sorry, the two doubly interesting things,
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:03.120]   which would be the quadrall interesting part about this, is that just last week they released an
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.080]   application development kit to developers. So third parties will be able to develop their own
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.880]   apps for the nook to expand its capabilities. Now, but this is the real interesting thing.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.320]   It is an Android tablet. You don't know that because it's just embedded. But there are ways
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:26.240]   that you can root this device and install arbitrary Android apps on it. So this is a nook from Barnes
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.600]   and Noble. Watch what happens. I mean, the extras draw when I tap this special button that I installed
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:40.080]   just this morning. Hey, look, it's the Kindle reader. So you can read all the content from the
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.480]   Kindle store on the nook as well. And if you're being a little bit even more clever about it,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   you can pretty much find any single app that's available for Android and get it running on this
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.760]   because the Android, well, they're not there. They're there. They just fill off the turnip truck,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.640]   these applications. They don't care what they're running on so long as they're running on something
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.080]   with a pulse. So in a sense, you will wind up for $250 getting probably exactly the sort of
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.280]   tablet that Android should be developing right now. I'm amazed this is just a book reader because,
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.160]   man, if Samsung were to sell this, just forget everything else, just simply say, no, it doesn't
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:25.120]   have 3G, but it's a $250 Android tablet that's built exceptionally well. It's a little bit slow,
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.400]   but for $250, it's exactly in the amount of money you want to pay. It has the only really external
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.880]   thing it has on it is that it does have an SD card slot. So you can just simply copy files,
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.080]   either you can either dock it to your Mac by USB and copy your media and your documents and
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.520]   stuff onto it that way, or you can just just put on to an SD card. I really like it a lot.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.480]   In the past 36 hours, I've gone from, gosh, this is a really nice premium book reader to,
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.600]   this could be exactly the sort of, this is exactly the statement about why you want a 7-inch tablet
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.200]   that costs $250 and not a 10-inch tablet that costs $500 for Mapple.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.440]   Or a 7-inch tablet that costs $600 from Samsung.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:16.320]   Plus $40 activation plus $40 a month plus a $35 fee if you decided to not use the 3G.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:24.640]   Yeah, I mean, there's got to be a market for mobile computers where you go in, you give a nice
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.720]   man or woman some money, you walk out with a device, and then you don't have to ever pay
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.520]   anybody any more money ever again. It seems that even in the announcement this morning about
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.360]   Google Chrome, part of the announcement was that, oh, well, though, it has 3G built in and we have
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:44.080]   the special contract with Verizon. You get free service to a certain degree, but is it possible
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.960]   to make sure that you always can get, walk out of there and never have to have a financial responsibility
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.440]   to anybody, anybody, ever again? It's like, it's like fathering a child out of wedlock.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.360]   You realize that it was fun for a little while, but I've got a financial obligation that I'm
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:03.120]   really, really not interesting. That's Martin Knopel's next ad campaign, I assume.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.920]   I'm a consultant on a just sort of a freelance basis, but you know, it's a good relationship.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:17.120]   It works pretty, it works pretty well. That is Mac Break Weekly for this week, our special super
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:25.120]   holiday fun time edition before we go. I might thanks to my super duper All-Star guest, starting
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.480]   with the creator of the creator and the grand clover of the super duper himself, Dave Nanian,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.160]   he can be his work can be found. His company is super, yeah, shirtpocket.com, shirtpocket software,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:41.680]   shirt-pocket.com. Dave, thanks for hanging on. Thanks a lot for having me.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:49.760]   And I did, I did David the service. I was only insulting Adam for exercising regularly and
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.520]   being relatively fit. Yeah, really. Dave is one of those people who went to Italy,
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.880]   not just to simply lie on a beach and eat incredibly good, fattening food, but to ride a bicycle up
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.400]   mountains. So, it's he's been breaking away. He knows what he's got to do to stay alive on those
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:13.760]   roads. That's right. Not only that, but you rode up the mountain and then you had a taxi cab drive
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.880]   you back to the bottom again, because going down the hill isn't as fun as going up the hill at 5,000
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.240]   feet on a bicycle. Now you're just exaggerating it.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:29.760]   I'm at the end of the show. We have to walk from here to that camera to turn it off and I'm
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.400]   going to get a little bit winded just walking around the screen. So, but super duper fantastic
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.440]   back of utility. If you do not have it, you're kind of a dope America, but download a free trial
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.560]   that will actually back up your entire hard drive. You'll see exactly how well it works. Rich Segal,
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:51.200]   our other Iron Chef of software development, who is the grandpuba of barebone software maker of
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.920]   various sundry utilities for the home user and the developer. I use the Ojimbo for a lot of my
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.880]   file data, random data, acquisition and management. Rich, thanks so much for joining me.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.320]   Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. If I may be allowed the intelligence.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.920]   Plug away. Absolutely. Plug away.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.520]   Just want to throw something out there. We're actually running a holiday special. We started
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.920]   this at the beginning of the month and it's going to go through the end of the month through
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:28.080]   December 31st inclusive. BVEdit is on holiday special pricing for $99. That's about 20% off.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.080]   It's regular retail price of 125. So, if you've been waiting for an excuse, you now have one.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.840]   And that's over at www.berebonds.com. And thank you.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.960]   Maybe it is a wonderful editor for years and years and years. It's such a streamlined,
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.600]   fast and useful text editor that every single trial, sometimes column that I wrote until I
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.240]   adopted Scribner a couple years ago was written on media. I still use it every time I need to
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.760]   edit CSS, every time I need to edit JavaScript or HTML. It's definitely an app with a thousand
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.320]   faces and I absolutely love it. All of Tony's is written in BVEdit as well.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.600]   I was going to say all of TIDBITS is written in BVEdit as well. We rely heavily on BBA
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.360]   at subversion integration with our content management system and things like that. So,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   support from Markdown. Yeah, love BVEdit. Yeah, my plug for our stuff is like Rich. We are taking
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.680]   advantage of the holiday season and having a big sale. And so, all of our take control
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.680]   once a year. So, you better make a while the snow is falling. That's right.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:39.040]   I mean, we didn't do the whole Black Friday, Cyber Monday things. One day, say whatever.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:44.880]   Through the end of the year, take control books, all of them, 50% off. So, we've got cool stuff like
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.960]   Joe Kistel's recent take control of your papillos office, which is one of the things you can actually
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.200]   do these days. Who knew? All these years we've been talking about, you could do a papillos office,
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:20:00.160]   but it wasn't true. Now you can. And a ton of other books about the iPad and the Mac and the iPhone
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:07.200]   and other stuff. So, if people go to www.takecontrolbooks.com, we'll find that there. I'll get something
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.240]   up on the homepage about the sale now. We've mostly been announcing it in Twitter and TIDBITS and
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.200]   direct email so far, but I'll get something on the homepage in a few minutes.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.120]   Have you guys thought about doing any take control of your take control books?
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   That's actually what we're working on right now, although it's not going to be a book. It's software
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.400]   inside our system. So, one of the things that we're learning as electronic publishers is that
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.600]   they're writing the books is easy. It's doing all the back end stuff that's hard. It's all about
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.040]   development and infrastructure now. Well, Adam, you work out, so I'm not worried about your back end
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:50.480]   at all. Jason, who holds the entire Mac community in the palm of his indifferent hand as the head of
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:58.000]   the book. Thanks for having me. My plug is, I'm going to make a non-Mac related plug because I
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.640]   know there's some geeky people who watch the Twit podcast. So, here's my plug. It's for a new
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:10.000]   podcast that I'm doing called The Uncomparable, which is about geeky topics like sci-fi and
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.560]   sci-fi books and movies and TV shows and other stuff like that, comic books, geeky stuff. So,
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.880]   if you are feeling a little bit geeky, please visit us at theincompable.com or search for the
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.320]   incomparable on iTunes. And there are a lot of interesting people who may somehow be Mac related
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.200]   who are on that podcast, but we don't talk about Mac stuff. There's a strict no-Mac stuff rule on
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.080]   that podcast. And it's a great podcast, so everybody should listen. No question. endorsement right there.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.440]   Thank you, Dan. Unsolicited testimonial. And once we're off, Mike, we'll do the solicitation.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:50.880]   My own plugging, you can see my stuff at sometimes.com, my writing stuff, not that other things. Like,
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.560]   a lot of people complain, so I don't do that anymore. But if you want to see my personal
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.400]   writings, I'm at cwob.com, these celestial ways to bandwidth. My own plug is that I've got,
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.280]   I'm doing my annual Amazon advent calendar, where for every day of the holiday season,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.720]   I recommend a different song that's available via Amazon MP3. Number one, because I'm a generous
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.160]   soul who wants to share pleasant music and things that are just lift the soul with everybody.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.800]   And also because, well, I've got my Amazon associates links going and probably the reason why I might
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.280]   be buying a niece a PlayStation is because I'm getting Amazon associates kickbacks for these
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.960]   music recommendations. So don't let that affect you, even though she's an adorable little girl,
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.040]   she really deserves a PlayStation. Anyway, so that is Mac Break Weekly for this week. My thanks
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:41.200]   to everybody. Mac, thanks to everybody for listening. Until then, brick times over, get back to work,
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.480]   yeah, go bricks.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:48.400]   Open our mat notes. Slow clap, Bravo.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:55.280]   We didn't say anything Jason, but boy, that last time when it had in the palm of your hand,
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.680]   you were really doing a little junk test there.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:04.640]   That was a TSA movie. That's especially, yes. You know, there's some Easter eggs here in the
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.760]   in the podcast. It's good to have Easter eggs. Speaking of the TSA screening.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.060]   [LAUGH]
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:25.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
