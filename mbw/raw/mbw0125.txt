[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Alex Lindsey, it looks like jammies.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Top of the morning to you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I'm sorry, it's just wrong.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You have to say, "It's crap, it's all crap."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We have many small dishes, crap, it's all crap.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Well, how are you today? Good to see you.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I'm doing quite well. Welcome.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We've got cameras, we've got lenses, it's not Twip,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   but we like to become --
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Sitting across from Alex Lindsey wearing the Azeric yellow
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   is Miss I Justine.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hello.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Is that your family's color?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   No, actually, at the store, the woman told me
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   that this was Mac and Cheese yellow.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   No, no, no, it's nuclear yellow.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's pretty bright.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's nuclear-waste yellow.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But it looks great on you.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I love it. It's very nice.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's good to have you. It's good for TV.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yes.

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It's like when those joint sessions of Congress,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   you have to keep at least two guests outside of the Twip

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's a nuclear strike.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm not going to say it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We wouldn't want the entire Twit army to be left here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I am your Secretary of Agriculture, Liam.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, you know what happened to her?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   No, tell us.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   She's a silent.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, actually, Andy, I'm sorry you're not here because we have
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   mini cupcakes.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, no.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Well, it's too bad.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's too bad.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I don't have a mailing address or anything.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it's impossible to like, you know, these are good.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   These are good squished, but I just-
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah, it's better.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You better.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's better off if you just keep all the delicious snacks
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and beverages for yourself.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They have a cream cheese frosting.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   They're a deep, dark, dark, rich chocolate.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And the beauty of this is you could pop it right into your
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   mouth.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It's small enough the entire cupcake.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That's so hard.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's good.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, to my virtual right.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That's where you were, Andy.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Get out of his lap.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Scott Born.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You know, don't bother me.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm installing a LIFO9.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You got it already?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's in the computer.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's just restarted and, and you know what?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I installed it about half a half.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That- Okay, it's time for a first look.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's installing it.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I can tell.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I can tell it's going to be good, Ollie.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   No, I installed it about an hour ago and I have opened each and every app
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   to confirm it's there.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And I played a little bit with the iMovie because I was very curious to
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   see how that was going to work.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And unlike the first time I got the new iMovie that I didn't understand,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   this time I kind of understood.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I think they finally did.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now, Justin, I'm sure when you were watching the keynote, you got all excited
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   about iMovie.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I hated OA.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's like I still use O6 whenever I need to shoot something or
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   edit.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   The so-called iMovie HD.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I mean, it works great.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   This looks like it has many of the features of HD kind of glommed onto
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   the interface of OA.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah, I'm definitely excited.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Did you hate the interface?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I hated the interface and I-
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You may still hate this.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and though I've used
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   everything.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Well, I think there's no timeline.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah, it's like, hey, I'm just going to drop these random clips here
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and use this yellow little outline to do that.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But I think now the new zoom-in, what do you- what do they call that?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   This is a zoom-in for- well, I'm just going to-
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Editing.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Precision editing.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Looks like that maybe helps a lot.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Because you were just kind of guessing.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   There's a separate window now that kind of is the timeline, and the secret is,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.200]   you know, control clicking on things gives you access to menus that let you do stuff
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.800]   you think makes sense.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   And after a few minutes, it actually started to make sense to me.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I have already determined the first Bugaboo news, though, that is that iMovie
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   O9 cannot import the very high HD quality 5D Mark II videos.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I guess I'm not surprised.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's 1080p.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Not yet.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Final cut.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We'll do it, though, right?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Well, I mean, I think that now when you bring it in, well, we'll test it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's- well, this is an Apple alert.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Apple says you can't know.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Apple says to resolve this issue, import footage from your Canon 5D Mark II in large
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   format, 960 by 540 instead of full format.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, that's what we're doing with like the 1080i cameras, the HV30, the HV30, the
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   HV20, the SD5.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But that was because they were 1080i.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Wouldn't you want to have it as a 1080p image?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I mean, if you can get a 1080p, but the thing that people need to realize is that if
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   you're not going to display that image on something larger than a 37-inch monitor,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   you're not going to be able to see the difference between an SSD and 1080p.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I can upload a mug, for instance.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   They've enabled 1080p uploading, so I can upload the full size quick time if I can edit it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And then what I was doing was using QuickTime to edit it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Cut and paste kind of editing, you know.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Right.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So you can still do that.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   As I said, it's one of those things that we used to produce, and we may still, just because
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   we want to keep the pipe working, we used to produce 1080p Mac rigs.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And we just realized that was just nuts.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   That was just crazy.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   He's insane.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Well, it forced us to build a pipeline that's been very good to us since then, but it was
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   a little insane.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   A little bit nuts.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And so we now produce everything.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Everything's coming out at 960 by 540.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's perfect.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's what I've been doing.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And it's really great for the SD5 or the HP30 or the HP20.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So that 960 by 540 gets the official Alex Lindsay approval?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I think for general purpose, it looks really good.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's easy to edit.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   What are you, Justine, what do you shoot in?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   What do you add to your back?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I actually, so since YouTube announced their new HD, and I mean, I don't like to edit an
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   HD because I end up just using my laptop and I just have like a small drive from traveling.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The latest MacBook Pro, so it's not like you have a slow laptop.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   No, no, no, I don't.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It works well.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.880]   But I mean, a lot of the stuff I just shoot on, I just use my eyesight.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   And then I have it.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   You're kidding.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.680]   And then I kind of cheat and I export it out to make it look like it's HD so that YouTube
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   reads as HD.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   So I mean, it works pretty well.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   But it's as good as.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   It looks really good.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   It looks great.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   You fool me.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   It really does.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   You fool, totally fool me.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.920]   And the new YouTube HD, my calculation is I believe it's something like 850 by 480 or
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   something like that.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.320]   Nothing's really HD in Flash, right?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   I mean.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.440]   Well, yeah, but it's, that's what it looks like the resolution that they're bringing
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   it down to.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.840]   They require you to bring it in at 1280 by 720, which I'm guessing is so that they have
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   future.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.400]   They'll be saving it that big.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.600]   But I think that what we're seeing on the screen when we download HD stuff is something
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   in the 850.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   It looks really good though.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   I was quite impressed.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.080]   Andy, did you get to Oh nine yet?
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   Not yet.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.000]   Believe it or not, I just dashed.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   There's a Santa, Santa Mel, my FedEx driver, rang the doorbell about 10 minutes ago.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.600]   And so I leapt from the microphone so I could say, yes, look, I just like we can do those
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   on Flickr.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.800]   You do those unboxings, photo series, like unboxing radio series.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.360]   And now there's a barcode on top of the scene.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.720]   So now I'm going to take the pin knife off mine.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.880]   But unfortunately, now it's just the new version.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.480]   You're going to hear me opening the box now.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   And you'll actually, I, Dana has strict instructions when the FedEx driver comes to bring because
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.800]   it is, I ordered it from Apple.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.400]   And I said overnight delivery, they said it'll be here on the 27th today.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   So we should all, we should all get it at the same time.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.480]   It's actually in stores today as well.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   Yes.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   Okay.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   We'll be making a trip.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   In fact, I have some, it's funny because I have some Mark five and SD five footage that
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.720]   I shot yesterday that I was going to use as a test case for this.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.200]   So anyway, we've talked a lot about the features of, of a, of a life on nine.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   We'll have a better review for you next week, but it should be out any minute now.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.720]   Yeah, we're going to hopefully shoot.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.600]   If we can get it today, hopefully we're going to shoot a couple tests for Mac break video.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   Oh good.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Tomorrow.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   Great.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.160]   And if they have at the Apple store, then I'll have one up as well.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.320]   And you can look for her and her eyesight cam recording footage of first look from Justine
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   at the Apple store.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   You do that a lot.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   I do.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   I have a problem.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   Do you drive up here?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   I took the bus.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320]   I took the bus.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   I, I did it.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   Golden gate transit.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   I'm so impressed.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   Oh, it was scary.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Did it work?
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   No, it was, it was my first time.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.840]   It's a bit of a ride because that's the local.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   There's an express that takes an hour that's actually faster than driving because he speeds.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.960]   We'll work on that one next time.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.440]   Yeah, the express, well, you can't get the express counter commute.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.400]   You could, but when you have the modem, then all you do is you, you just sit there.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.960]   I just sit there and serve all the way up.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   It's just playing on the bus.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.520]   So it's like, I blogged from the bus.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.080]   That's, that's my blog right now.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.560]   Also new as we sat down, I plugged in my iPhone and lo and behold the iPhone two, two, one
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.200]   software update.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.400]   Justine, you don't have it either.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.640]   It looks like it's bug fixes and improvements improved general stability of Safari.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.480]   Safari crashes a lot on the iPhone, doesn't it?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   It does.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   Mine crashes a lot.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   They needed to do this.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   It also says fixed issue where some, where some images say from mail do not display correctly
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.520]   in the camera roll.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.680]   Did you see that thread on the Apple discussion forums?
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.080]   The wife who puts up the message saying, yes, I know.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.920]   Andy saw this.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.880]   She puts up a message saying, okay.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.480]   I found a naked picture of my husband on his iPhone and it had been mailed to somebody.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.520]   My husband says, well, yeah, I took the picture, but the iPhone sometimes does that automatically
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.280]   mails them.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.360]   And, and, and then of course everybody on the discussion forum is saying, dude, no,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   it doesn't.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.600]   So I was waiting to see it in this techno, maybe it would say and stops automatic mailing
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   of naked pictures.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Exactly.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   I'm a girlfriend.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   I read that.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   I think my theory is that like, Blagojevich was gonna like confess everything and then
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.080]   thought, you know what, I would not have the biggest cahonies in any man in the world
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.760]   because this guy told his wife that no, just as a matter of fact, that's not even a picture
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   of me.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   It just sort of comes with the phone.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   It comes with the phone.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   That's one of the free, you know, there's a deal with Daisy's.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   There's a bird.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   I was mad about this as you are.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   They say, they make it old man.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.840]   And the naked old man, you know, phone compatible, products compatible with a software update,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   iPhone, iPhone 3G, there is an iPod touch to two, one as well.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.600]   So, wait a minute, did one of this supposed to happen right after we do the show?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.720]   Yeah, I kept believing that.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   What a slip.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.120]   I'm hoping that this doesn't deactivate the emoji icons because I will cry.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.640]   Justine found the greatest little tip.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   And thank you, Justine.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.040]   I have to thank my friend, a shot for sending me that.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.280]   So tell us how you do it.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.680]   Well, you have to download this app called Frosty Place.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.440]   It's an RSS reader for Chinese.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.800]   It's like a Japanese Chinese RSS reader.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.680]   It's just like a Macintosh news site.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.080]   So you download that and then you play around with the app and that activates something.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   You have to play around a lot.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   I think you just click the bottom.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   Oh, is that?
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   Because I do.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.960]   I had it the first time and nothing happened.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.560]   So I kept reading stories and in comprehensible stories in Chinese.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.800]   I keep getting all these emails.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.320]   People are like, I want my 99 cents back.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.080]   I'm like, you just play around with the app a little more.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   So then what happens?
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.560]   Then you go into the general settings and then you go into international and then to
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.160]   keyboards and then the Japanese setting.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.760]   Normally, there's two settings in there, the Japanese setting, but a third will appear.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.680]   Yes, a third will magically appear.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.400]   It's the emoji option.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.000]   Click it on and then you just have tons of icons.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.080]   I've spammed everyone in my contract list.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   I have two.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   I got some.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   I was like, I don't know if Leo's number.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.080]   I could spam him.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   Oh, it's so cool.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   Wait, give me, I'll give you your number.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.600]   And there's some weird emojis in there.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.080]   There are some very weird ones.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.320]   Some of my friends have been sending things.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.400]   I'm like, I don't know what that icon is.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.960]   At first, it looks like they're not that many, but it turns out that each page has many
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   pages.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   There's a ton of them.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   There's every.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.280]   You should see the emoji icons on that guy's iPhone that sent the nude pictures.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   Oh, well, there's one.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520]   Okay.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.520]   Those are real.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   There's a couple of weird ones.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   There's a toilet.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520]   There's a toilet.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.840]   There's a little steaming pile of something.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   I know.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   Is that what it is?
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   Well, somebody, I said it to someone.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   No, I don't think so.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.480]   But I said it to someone and they said, it's not a burk Dorito.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.760]   I was like, I don't think that's a burk.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   Oh my gosh.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.000]   I was sending it to you as a little.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.240]   It's got the little lines coming on.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   That's what it is.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   That is so weird.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Not a Dorito.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.720]   Why do they put that in there?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   I love it.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   That's my favorite.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   You send that a lot.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.480]   You just say, you go, I feel like, and then you just put that little emoticon there and
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   you're set.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.920]   There's like a little shower that I mean, it's just the weirdest.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   It's very strange.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.400]   Apparently these are big in Japan.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.960]   You would know because you were just there.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   They're very big.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.400]   You can't sell a cell phone in Japan that doesn't support emoji because they use them
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.640]   in their text messages to, you know, enhance them just as we do smiley faces, but they're
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   not.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.280]   That's the Unicode character set.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   That's the problem.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.520]   You can only see them on an iPhone.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.680]   Does the iPhone that you're sending to have to be emoji enabled?
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.160]   It just has to have the 2.2 firmware update and it works because I think they activated
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   that for the Japanese.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.400]   Right, because you couldn't sell it without that.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   So it's pretty awesome.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   It's really cool.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   It works.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.720]   It works like Tweety will show it in Twitter, but then people who are looking at Twitter
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.600]   on the web will just see boxes.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   It even shows up in your email, even like on different websites and stuff like that
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.120]   because people were leaving them in my blog comments and it still shows up.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.120]   And it shows up?
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.880]   Are you using a plugin for Firefox or something?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   No, not on the iPhone.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   Yeah, not actually.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   I'm excited.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.720]   Yeah, see, there is a Firefox plugin, but it's a grease monkey script.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.320]   And when I read it, it said this breaks JavaScript on some sites.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.240]   I thought, I'm not installing that.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.560]   Yeah, just use my iPhone.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.080]   Well, okay, I have emojis enabled in here and it is now updating my iPhone 2.2.1.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   We'll see.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   Okay.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   You don't have to do it.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   All right.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   If it screws me up.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   I won't.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   I'm doing.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   That's my job.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.600]   Well, that's about it for the show.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.800]   Well, thank you all for being known.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.920]   You got a new update to the MacBook.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   What?
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.400]   They just up quietly updated the MacBook last week.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   You mean hardware?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   Yes, that's right.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   Hardware.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.680]   Oh, the white MacBook is now practically a MacBook Pro.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.640]   Well, it doesn't have fire.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.040]   So it's not that I'm bitter.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.840]   It's more like the unibody 13.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   Yeah, so you now have, you can go up to two gigs of RAM.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.960]   They improve the video card.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   So it's good.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   It's the 90s.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's small stuff.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   Which one?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   94,000?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   Yeah, I believe it's the 9400.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   Well, that's good.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   Yeah, so it's small stuff, but it's nice to, we've been actually waiting.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   We had to buy a couple of them.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.560]   So we were very glad that we waited.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.600]   Just a lot of schools, places like that use the white Mac, the plastic MacBook as a kind
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   of an entry level Mac.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.160]   It's great for students.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.120]   I think the polycarbonite case is more robust than that.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.600]   You know, just doing photos and not really much video.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.120]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   My wife got them.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.320]   She ended up getting a MacBook Pro only because she needed more screen real estate.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.640]   But otherwise, everything she was doing.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.760]   I got the Pro because I needed the fire wire.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.760]   That was very frustrating.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   I had to get it just because of that one thing.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.880]   For me, RAM, and there's a lot of things.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.520]   I mean, for me, it wasn't really an option because I have to actually work.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.680]   You know what I did over the, over the weeks since we've met last?
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   What did you do?
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   What did you do?
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.000]   So busy, busy, busy.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.120]   I got an MSI Wind, which is the little, I should have brought it.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   I don't know why I didn't bring it in.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.040]   It's the netbook, one of the netbooks for it.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.720]   You can get it for $329.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.560]   I got the bigger battery and the bigger hard drive, 160 gig hard drive.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.440]   So it's $429, very reasonable.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.560]   It runs, comes with XP, runs Windows 7.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.640]   But it says almost trivial to install OS 10 on it and runs to OS 10 beautifully.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   Really?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.080]   According to, one, one had a great table that showed which ones the MSI Wind and the Dell
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.840]   Mini, which are essentially the same hardware as the, in fact, the advent makes one too.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.200]   Actually, I haven't, I haven't, make some for them, all three of them.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.960]   Run without any additional drivers or anything.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.080]   They just, and the camera works, everything works.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   Wi-Fi works.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   Does a camera work?
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.520]   Nah, maybe a camera doesn't work.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   External cameras work.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.800]   I can't remember if the built-in camera works, but the Wi-Fi works.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.320]   You have to download a new real tech driver.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.680]   So it's a little, it's the mini, it's the little.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.880]   I do mean I flinched.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.200]   I saw the article in Wired and I was like, "God, I'll make a great Mac break video."
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.440]   And then I saw the cease and desistra apples into Wired.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.480]   And I was like, "Maybe not."
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.040]   Come on, just saying your touch.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.600]   Stay away from the cliff.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.880]   No, I want to face this where they saying that the first moment does not apply to Wired.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.960]   They didn't sue, but Wired, I think just got, you know, encouragement and pulled it down.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.480]   Wired decided it was prudent.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.840]   I showed on live stream, I showed the upgrade.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.040]   Just kind of, and I do feel like, well, is the First Amendment protect you and does the
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.720]   First Amendment protect you in this case?
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   It's research.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.960]   It's, there is, as my fact, I've been getting some advice on, there's something that I need
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.200]   to write in the future regarding downloading movies illegally.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   Basically, there is a case to be made that if I decided to download a certain number of
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.000]   various illegal sites and the recording history came after me, I could say, "No, this is research
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.480]   for an article that I'm writing about this and that it would be a very difficult case
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   to prosecute."
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.360]   I don't understand how, if Wired decided to pull that down, it wasn't because Apple had
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   any legal justification for saying that they don't have a right to publish instructions
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.000]   on how to get an operating system running on an on Apple piece of hardware.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.880]   On the other hand, you don't want to get go to court against people who buy lawyers by
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   the bushel either.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.000]   Well, I don't think, I don't think, there wasn't a legal, I don't think Apple was giving
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   a legal threat.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.200]   Apple was just requesting that they take it down and I think that the, the real danger,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.440]   typically with Apple is not when they make those kind of requests, is that if you ever
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.840]   want to talk to anyone here again, you'll take that down.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   It's not a matter of legal.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   It's not a matter of legal.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   I don't care about that so much.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   What?
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   I didn't worry about that so much.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   I just didn't write.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.320]   I think that there might be a difference between saying, as I was doing, I was doing research
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.760]   and happened to be on camera, but I was doing research to see if it could be done.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.080]   In fact, I took it off because I, it feels weird to have a OS 10 running on that thing.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   It's just dirty.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   It's dirty.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   Yes, it really is.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.160]   It doesn't belong on me.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.920]   It's just like, what have I done?
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   What have I done?
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920]   Just because I could do it doesn't mean I should.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   I need to go shower now.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.000]   You're one of those people who turned the lights off before, aren't you Leo?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You need to spice things up a little bit.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.400]   Yeah, which by the way, it doesn't work so well on, on, on video because it's too dark.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.280]   But the process worked fine and I think I could make a case there that it was, you
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.440]   know, research.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.720]   But if you post a video, a how-to video, then that goes into that.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.480]   Now you're showing somebody how to break the law, right?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.500]   Well, part of the problem here is you've got to worry about violating Apple's right to
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.080]   protect, you know, trade secrets.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.440]   And they not only have that right, but obligation to bring litigation, if that comes to bear.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.040]   And, you know, a lot of the things that we hear about Apple's legal department and people
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.160]   be moaning that Apple sued somebody.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.440]   I've said this before on the show.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.800]   Sometimes they simply have no choice.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   It really depends.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.280]   But I understand from looking at this situation, there was no legal threat and it could have
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.240]   just been, Hey, would you mind taking it down and why I decided?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.880]   Yeah, I probably don't mind if we take it down.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.400]   Are you shaving, Andy?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Nothing.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   Are you using the razor app on your iPhone?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   What are you doing?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.080]   Yeah, I mean, I was a little nervous and that somebody punked me while I was doing it.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.120]   I got three calls from 408-99-61010, which is the, as everyone knows, is the main line
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   for Apple.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.200]   But I looked at it and I thought, you know, I don't ever remember getting a call from
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   the main line.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.960]   You know, if Apple calls you, it's not from the main line, it's from the, and then they
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   didn't leave a message.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.360]   I thought, okay, that's, that's, I'm being punked.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   No, when Apple calls, they call from a zip code formally assigned to the Mars specialist.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.960]   This is Mars Phoenix.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.600]   You are violating our copyright.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.840]   I would love if Apple called me.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   Apple, call Justine, would you please?
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.600]   I would never say, just something.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.000]   You mean you'd never like talk to a PR person or anything from Apple?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.960]   No, no, they're like, she's going to keep doing what she's doing for the rest of her
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   lives.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.000]   So let's just let her just keep doing it.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.840]   Now you've been, you've been to Cupertino though.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   I have.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.480]   But, but she took the bus.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.680]   I didn't, I didn't take the bus.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.400]   That's, that's like Charlotte's arriving at Paramount Studios in 1942 with a single suitcase
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.520]   on a dream.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.800]   It's Schwab's drugstore all over again.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   I mean, I did see Steve at that point though, but he saw me and he ran the other way and
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.840]   it was kind of, he ran.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.000]   He, I mean, he literally picked up.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.720]   We weren't sure how healthy he was, but when he saw me, he saw you picked up his stuff
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   and ran.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.400]   He sat down like he was going to eat his lunch in the Mac Cafe and literally like looked
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.600]   over saw me and it's like took all of his stuff and just you're making a beeline for
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   him.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   And he, were you making a beeline?
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.120]   No, I was just like, oh my God.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   You were just looking at him.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   I was just looking at him.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.680]   And he was gone.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.800]   There's a reason he took off.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.000]   He was actually secretly eating a steak.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Oh, Cheeseburger.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.200]   Descriptions steak.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.000]   It doesn't go.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.400]   Oh, by the way, have you seen all the rumors?
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.720]   I don't even want to talk about them anymore.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   Okay.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.280]   I talked about it on Twitter and I felt really dirty afterwards.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.080]   I'll recap briefly.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   You're seeing a lot of rumors.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   I've talked to some, we have a listeners and oncologist and she says on the oncology
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   forums, almost everybody's agreed that it's every, every bit of information they've got
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.440]   sounds like a recurrence of the cancer.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.160]   There was a rumor that he checked in his Stanford Medical Center yesterday for surgery.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.200]   You know, and then there was a really creepy, stupid, and this is what made me kind of want
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.640]   to get off of this.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.880]   Somebody posted what I'm sure is a fake medical transcriptions of Steve saying he had HIV.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.520]   Oh, man.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   That's cruddy.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.960]   That's just low and we offer a reward for that person's IP.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   No kidding.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   I mean, that's just awful.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.400]   So I, at this point, what I, I don't even want to say it again, but I'm going to say
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.800]   it again because it's already out there.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.160]   But what I said is it seems to me that what everybody's greatest fear is and what everybody's
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.720]   really thinking in their minds is that this is it.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.280]   And, but nobody wants to say it and we all want to respect Steve's privacy, but there
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.760]   is that kind of sense, it seems to me in the community.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.040]   I'm reporting on that not so much on what I don't know what's happening to Steve.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.240]   God, I hope he's fine and I can't wait till he comes back to Apple, but there does seem
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.560]   to be the sense in the entire community, maybe just because we're a bunch of pessimists
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   that, and this is it.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.240]   Right.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.120]   I know what really bothers me about this is, and maybe I'm reading it wrong.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:46.400]   I hope I'm reading it wrong, but the internet has made people so cynical and so unaccountable.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.760]   And I, I actually sometimes detect a little glee in some of these people.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   That's what makes me sad.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.600]   And I'm like, you know, what kind of people are these?
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.240]   And do they have people they care about or are they just literally so, so centered that
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.720]   they don't care about anybody with themselves?
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.440]   I mean, if the poor man has got this, this disease to the point where he's got to have
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.520]   surgery and I don't care what you've got.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.360]   If you got to have surgery, it's traumatic, it's difficult.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.320]   And it doesn't matter how rich or poor or bigger, small, you are, it's, it's a big deal
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.520]   to those who love you, to those around you.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.360]   And it's way more important than the stupid Apple computer company.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   Sorry.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   I just had a rant.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.760]   Yeah, we love you.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.160]   And, and he's got a family.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   He's got kids.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.520]   You know, this is, I wouldn't wish this son anybody.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.640]   According to Mike Errington, he met or he has sources.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   Sources.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   I hate sources.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.280]   He has sources who met with jobs yesterday, which means he isn't in the Stanford Medical
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   Center.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.080]   So that Valley WAG is promoting a lot of this.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.880]   Anything for a track bag link, don't even get me started.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.320]   Yeah, Valley WAG is awful.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   Isn't it?
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.600]   We're getting very close to the point in which there's going to be tech gossip to the same
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.920]   level of their entertainment gospel.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   It is.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   It already is.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   Oh, it definitely is.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.240]   It's going to be TM, it's going to be TMP instead of TMZ or something like that.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.320]   And, you know, anyway, so I don't want to, I'm bringing it up not to say anything about
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.520]   Steve's condition, but to note the response in the community.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.040]   Well, can we mention, can we mention something that I don't think we've talked about that's
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   positive?
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   Did anybody happen to pay?
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   I mean, you know, I'm the guy I guess that pays attention to stuff like this.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.240]   Anybody pay attention to quarterly results?
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Can we have an amen?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Oh, hello.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:35.720]   Microsoft, everybody Google, tell it until 90% drop Apple, best up quarter ever up best
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.880]   quarter ever.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.360]   So here's the thing.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.800]   We are all talking about this down economy and sure enough, the economy is down.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.440]   But what I think we're seeing is that when people become more careful with their money,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.040]   they avoid folks that suck.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.360]   And you know, the thing is Apple doesn't suck and they're doing well.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.240]   And I got to tell you everywhere I go, I'm seeing people that suck and I'm thinking,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.880]   man, how can you afford to suck in this economy?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.520]   The companies that do well are going to flourish.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:10.040]   And you know, for everybody to say that Apple's doomed and they're not at Mac world anymore
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.160]   and Steve Jobs is sick and blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   Oh, by the way, we just had our best quarter ever.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   How is that not?
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160]   How is that not the story?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.880]   Best quarter ever and $20 billion in the bank.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   No debt.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.080]   How's that not the lead story on Valley Way?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.320]   That should be the lead story.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   Steve, what's your cell phone number?
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.120]   I just want to send you an emoji.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.960]   You want to write that?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.800]   Just give that out over the air while I know you.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.840]   And we'll make sure that Apple calls you right it small because people have got really
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   good eyes.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   Oh boy.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   Dee Dee Dee.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.400]   Let's all look at Alex Lindsey's shirt for a while.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.640]   Dee Dee Dee Dee.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.440]   So no, I just the two to one update is done.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.200]   First thing actually I want to check is to see if this podcast RSS program is still there
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   and still works.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.640]   You RSS player and yep, my podcasts are in there.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   This is the one.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.880]   This is podcaster, the one that Apple prevented from being part of the iTunes application library
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.120]   yesterday.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.760]   They allowed it to go in there.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.240]   What they took out though is weird.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.640]   They took out the directory functionality.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.120]   So you have to hand enter a URL.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.160]   So just for those of you listening, if you've downloaded RSS player, I think it's 99 cents.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.360]   It comes with quote their favorite podcast, which is Buzz out loud from Cnet.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.200]   Hey, where's ours?
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.440]   Yeah, where's us?
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]   Where's us?
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.720]   So I'm going to tell you what ours is so you can you can enter it in.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.640]   You press the plus plus button.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.960]   It's and you have to enter this hand and this is not how podcasting was meant to be.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   HTT.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.680]   You even have to type HTTP colon slash slash.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.960]   And it is Leo dot AM slash podcasts slash MBW.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.360]   And if you enter that in, then then then you can listen and it looks like it's streaming
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.520]   the MP3 like it doesn't look like it downloads it.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.440]   It's like when you press play, it'll listen to it.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.480]   You can always copy and paste it, right?
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   Oh, that's right.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   You can't.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   You, you're bad.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   What has been two years?
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.120]   You can't even send multiple photos.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.160]   I mean, get the multi photo app.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160]   That's my new favorite.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   Oh, is it?
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   Yes, multi photo lets you send multiple photos.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   Yes, I've been using that a lot.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.080]   We're going back to I for it.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.080]   Do it.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.560]   You know, I didn't realize is the I for guy has a long lineage of software design and
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   so forth.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.560]   He's been around for quite some long lineage of farting.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.200]   I was going to say he's kind of got a long range of smelly stuff.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.000]   Hey, hey, hey, wait, I'm sorry.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.280]   I just want to go back and send you a shell and I'm going to send you a hammer hitting
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.960]   something weird.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.600]   We don't know what even what it's hitting.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.960]   How about this?
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.440]   Would you guys take your private emoji experiences?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   Here's a 38.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.040]   It's a 30 pistol and a guy surfing.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.000]   And what did you think about the fact that nearly 23.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   I'm going to send you a new dress.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   She's getting a new green dress.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.080]   I have a unique opportunity here to leverage their their investment in both media and the
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   creation of media.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.760]   Doctor and a new generational content tools.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   Now, if they give them the other.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   I'm not you works.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   Do you work?
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   It does not break the emotions that server load is always going to have to be balanced.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.920]   Now, if Apple were to install like sort of a sliding scale of royalties in the eye in
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.840]   the front of the iPhone store, if they were to if they were to articulate this iPhone
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.280]   app store model towards music towards books, stores, things like that, we could have a
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.600]   whole new paradigm for content.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   Andy's going to keep talking while I do a commercial.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.680]   I just don't care about you.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   I got my people pooping.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.080]   We're going to come back with more stories, including our picks of the week.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.960]   Steve Nazarek is here from iJustine.com.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.920]   We love Justine also here in Lindsey Plaid, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:00.240]   Andy Enoco is on the line from Boston, Massachusetts of the Chicago Sun times, Scott Born of Trip
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.560]   Photo.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:07.640]   And I want to tell everybody to run out, run, do not walk and get yourself a copy of go
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.400]   to meeting now.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.080]   Mac enabled the folks at Citrix.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.280]   I'm thrilled to say are Mac fans.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.760]   And yay.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.360]   And so they have they have made go to meeting work with Mac and Windows, of course.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.720]   I want you to go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.560]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak and try it free for 30 days.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.800]   Now here's the deal with go to meeting.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   You put it on your system.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.440]   I got a I got a note.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.280]   I got a note from an IT guy.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.840]   It was so cute.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.160]   He said, would you not tell people to put software on their system without my permission?
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   You don't need that permission.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   Ha ha ha ha.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   Just put it on.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   This is a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.160]   You go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.880]   The reason you don't need to worry about the IT department is it goes.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.440]   It doesn't need to be configured for the router or the firewall.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.440]   It just works.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.000]   And once you've got it set up, it automatically interfaces with your outlook.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.760]   And so if you're using Windows, of course, I think it probably goes with on to Raj on
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   the Mac.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.480]   You can send a meeting invitation.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.640]   They just click a link.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.280]   They don't have to install anything.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Mac or Windows.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.880]   They just click the link.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.000]   Go to go to meeting.com and suddenly they're seeing your desktop on their screen.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.400]   So they see your PowerPoint or your keynote.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.160]   They see your drawings.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   You can collaborate.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.000]   You can say, hey, I'm working on this paragraph.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Could you help me out?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And you can work together.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.440]   I've done it to practice speeches where we're in different places and we have a slideshow
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.040]   and we're talking to the slideshow and it's fast enough that we can go in real time practicing
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   back and forth.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   It means amazing.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.800]   You can even use it for training.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.440]   If you've got, let's say you've already got your iLife09 and you want to show somebody
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.640]   how to use a new iMovie.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   They don't have it yet.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.520]   You can let them take control of your computer and use it.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.920]   This thing is so powerful.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.320]   Watch it to try it for 30 days free.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.880]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.040]   It's a great product from great people at Citrix and I know you're going to want to
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   try it.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.400]   It's really heartily for making a Mac version and supporting a Mac break weekly.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   They're part of the Mac community now.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.760]   I'm just relaxed.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   Emoji works.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   I can relax now.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.480]   Other stories in the news have even following the John Gruber Adobe.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.960]   There's actually a website adobegrips.tumbler.com.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.720]   People are upset about the user interface for CS4.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.800]   What's that all about?
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   Have you seen that?
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.360]   Well, I have one gripe.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.240]   Okay, what's your score?
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.840]   On my lap, on my Mac, and maybe someone can call in or email us, but I've talked to people
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.520]   and no one that I know and I know a lot of people know how to disable this, but they
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   have all this new rotation stuff that was built into the new MacBook, the two finger
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.520]   stuff where you can rotate.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520]   It just doesn't work?
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.280]   When you open CS4 in an image, if you put your fingers down for too long, it just starts
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.920]   rotating the image and you have to go back and reset it every single time.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   I haven't found any preference.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.080]   I went through all the preferences.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   I went through all the stuff.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   I'm trying to find a way to turn it off because I never, ever wanted to do that.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.280]   I know it seems like it was a good idea.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   It wasn't.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.320]   At least it should be default off and then you can turn it on if you want and then you
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.720]   should be a big button on how to turn it off.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.880]   But outside of that, I think that the interface has been great.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.840]   You got to go to this blog there.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   What is it?
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.480]   I'm looking at the entry for Wednesday, January 21st.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.200]   That fans feels very, very passionate about the tabbed interface.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.400]   Adobe gripes.tumbler to you and the other CS4 disabled the blank tabular interface.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.240]   I want to open 10 images to drag my side to side.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.800]   Oh, look, they all went full blanking screen.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Nice work.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   You bunch of blanks.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.280]   When out of your ugly point, it was like a genius tab blank.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   You mentioned everyone how it worked before.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.840]   Is it going to use a blank for you?
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.240]   This is really funny.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.440]   Whether or not there are UI issues, it's a bit.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.600]   There should be like the next like love letters.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.240]   They should do like Stephanie Zimbalist Jr. and another actor just one by one.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.760]   Would it have killed you to spend half an hour giving the common library items?
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.920]   Seal the oars.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.280]   Dame Judith Evans reads Adobe UI gripes.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.000]   I sat through that hour long installer sequence.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.440]   Yet this wasn't even installed fully.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.720]   You know, there's always gripes every time there's a change with software.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.080]   I happen to like the new user interface.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.560]   I mean, it takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's definitely more efficient.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.480]   There's far fewer keystrokes.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.200]   There's far fewer.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   There's less distance for the mouse to travel.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   I like it.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.720]   Outside of the one rotation issue that I was having, I love it.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   All right.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.600]   So we'll sit back, let John Gruber gripenmonen self into the, you know, leave it there.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.880]   I don't think he's did this Adobe UI gripes site, but the he, if you read the daring fireball
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.280]   that now he has some other issues, issues.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.040]   Now if you're a pirate, you're going to get spanked.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.600]   And if you try to download I work so nine, yeah, there's a Trojan horse in there.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.880]   Oh, actually there's two new Trojan horses.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.440]   It takes all the fun out of it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.000]   It's the app.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.560]   The exploit tool is labeled Apple script Trojan horse template.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.880]   The guys at Mac shadows.com don't go there.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.720]   Do not go there.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   The guys that do.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   Hey, I said don't go there.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   Don't go.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   Stop.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.080]   Oh, like 18 people just went there.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.840]   Yeah, I could feel it.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.280]   I probably put their site down or everyone go down there right now.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   We just don't download or anything.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.760]   I feel a great circle around the force.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.440]   You it appears to be a collective and ongoing effort to create a package of malicious software.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.160]   This is very much what happens in the windows side where you have websites that sell packages
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.440]   you can install on your website or somewhere else that will take advantage of any unpached
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.320]   machine that comes there.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.440]   This takes advantage of that odd agent hole that we talked about, which has been patched,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.640]   by the way, hasn't it?
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.440]   I believe so.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.320]   And it's not such a good exploit because you really have to get the user to cooperate
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.320]   with you.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.240]   It's not something you can like sneak up on them, wrap them on the head.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.400]   Nevertheless, all the windows people who, well, and the hard thing with the Mac is that it's
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.360]   hard to really put something in there unless you can get the user to manually input their
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.360]   password.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   So by having an installer that they think that they want and then asking them to that
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.600]   it's once you open up that gate.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:39.480]   So the one and I work on nine with the pirate version, which is on the BitTorrent's installs
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:46.560]   a startup item called IWorkSavage, oh, I meant the IWork installer, IWorkServices.package is
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   installed as a startup item with read, write, execute abilities.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.600]   According to Intigo, the Mac antivirus company, the rogue software connects to a remote server,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:02.000]   notifies its creator that the Trojan's been installed and then the bad guy can connect
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.080]   to them and use this remote access vulnerability to get in there, which is not good.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.520]   According to Intigo, 20,000 people already have downloaded the installer.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.960]   It's scary too because we think that we're so untouchable.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.120]   So I mean, if you think I was downloading iLife09, I'm so excited.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.560]   I have to say, I don't feel too bad.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.400]   These are people who are pirating this item.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.520]   And if you're downloading it from some sketchy website, then that's your fault.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.440]   But this is what Windows users do all the time.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   This happens a lot.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.680]   And one of the rules on Windows is you don't accept files from strangers.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.080]   Or just don't use a Windows computer.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.040]   I mean, that's really very, very simple.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.040]   Don't use Windows.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   Come on, guys.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.760]   Intigo also says it discovered a new variant of the same Trojan horse in pirated versions
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.080]   of Photoshop CS4.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.680]   I hate the UI and CS4.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.080]   It installs this thing in my startup menu.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   Man.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.320]   I don't have a lot of sympathy for folks that run into these problems.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.080]   It is sort of a significant point in that it is actual live in the field proof that there
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.560]   are people writing exploits for Mac software.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.960]   I think they're just waiting for a good reason or a good mechanism to deploy it all.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.360]   And if Apple ever did something really cool or really tricky with QuickTime that added
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.440]   a really wonderful new feature for root access without our knowledge, then suddenly this
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.040]   would stop being something that's only affected by people who like to steal software and becomes
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.960]   affected by just somebody who wants to access their iTunes library remotely.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.880]   I think that's a very good point.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.400]   We are a little complacent.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   And part of the reason we're protected is because nobody's really trying to get into
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   our systems.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.360]   Part of it is, though, that at least for right now, it's not as easy as on Windows.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.520]   And that's why these Trojans work because you're literally getting the person to install
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   you.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   But you're right, Andy.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.960]   At some point, there'll be a hole somewhere that won't work.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.960]   It's interesting.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.320]   The dinosaurs are testing the electrified fence.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.600]   Well, I think that especially as the Mac continues to become more successful and it's going to
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   continue to become more successful.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.800]   And we're going to see the percentage.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.080]   There's going to be some breakpoint where it becomes a valid target.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.680]   At 3%, it wasn't a valid target.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.240]   At 10%, maybe it's a valid target.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.080]   At 15% or 20% of the market, it becomes a valid target to go after.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.720]   Did they say in their earnings call, Scott, what market share?
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.840]   Was the market share going up still or I think it went down a little bit, didn't it?
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.440]   I didn't respond to that part of the call.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:39.000]   I was gone, but I do look at the up sales are like 1.5 billion over last.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.160]   Let me double check here.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.560]   22 million iPods, more than 4 million iPhones.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.720]   Those numbers just sound big.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.040]   4 million in a three month period.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:58.440]   And they sold 2.22 million, 524,000 Macintosh computers, up 9% on the last three months.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.120]   And everything was up.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:09.200]   They sold 88% more iPhones in the final quarter of 2008 than they did in 2007.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.760]   Their projections, of course, going forward are smaller, which of course they have to
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.880]   do, plus in this economy.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   It's not a surprise.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   But I was kind of taken aback by these iPod numbers in particular.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.040]   They're still massive.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.880]   I mean, you would think everybody's got a stinking iPod by now.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   You know?
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.280]   Yeah, well, they're buying their second, third, fourth, and fifth.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.200]   20 to check this out.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   This is in three months.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.600]   22 million, 727,000 iPods.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   It is.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   It has to be the biggest quarter for them, right?
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   Because it's the holiday Christmas.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   It is.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   It's the biggest quarter.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   But I think I'm a good cross-section.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.640]   And I think I have every or at one point in time had every iPod made, except for the first
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.640]   two.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   First two, I actually tried.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   I kept on trying to find cheaper.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   Really?
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   I was like, ah, I don't want to pay that much money.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   I don't want to pay that much money.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   It still works.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   Not the first generation used.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   There it is.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   There it is.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840]   I still, I like the--
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   It's big.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   I like the mechanical roller.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   It's got some mechanical.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.840]   I know.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840]   It's five gigs.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   You could cut them with those sharp edges.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   I know.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.920]   It's got less memory than a shuffle, which you could clip to your lapel.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.080]   The scroll wheel is still better.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   I can top that.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:20.040]   I actually have a-- the company that made the zip drives, they thought, you know what?
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.680]   These zip drives that we're making, they're so reliable and they never crash.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   They never have--
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.120]   Let's create a miniature version and build a portable music player around these portable
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   zip drives.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   Terrible idea.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   Terrible idea.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   And you have that?
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   I still have it.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   Terrible idea.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.280]   It's part of the Not Go archives.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.840]   There's this box of stuff.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.360]   It's not even like the island of misfit toys because those toys are at least lovable.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.520]   You know what's good?
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.920]   This original iPod is like firewire charging.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   Right.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.360]   I finally found a connector with firewire on it that still was in my drawer somewhere.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.160]   The only bad thing about that is it was like last year I could not for some reason find
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.000]   any of my iPods except for that one.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.240]   So I'm like, I'm just going to go for a little walk.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.360]   But every time you move, the wheel turns.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.640]   So I kept turning down my music and changing music.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   Really?
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   Your wheels lose.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   It's not supposed to--
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   It's not supposed to--
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   But it wasn't a good thing.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.800]   But then you have to have a special firewire cable.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.640]   That's right because this is not-- this has the fire-- this has a six pin firewire connector
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   on the top.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   It's actually with-- I bought one of the G drives and it comes with--
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.560]   But it has to be a specially wired one.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.240]   I think you can't use a regular cable.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.640]   Can I charge it with just the other one?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   You did?
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   Oh, cool.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   I have to charge this up.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   I wonder what's on here.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   I know.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   That was great.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   I'm like, I'm just going to listen to this.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   Never gonna give you up.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.640]   Never gonna give you down.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   Never gonna--
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   That was me.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   Oh, God.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   That was--
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   Just recalled you.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   But I bet that's what's on here.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   I've got computers and real iPods and stuff like that.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.360]   So five years later, there are times when I actually need to revive one of my old power
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.240]   books just because I need to check out something on System 8 or System 9.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.120]   And like, wow, this is the-- because it has all my music on it, all my email, all my contacts,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   everything I was writing.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.920]   It's like, my God.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.840]   It's like I moved out of my mom and dad's house and they kept the room exactly as I
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.800]   left it in 1986, 1987.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.920]   And by just plugging this power adapter in, I could see exactly what my world was like.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   Like five or six years ago.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.920]   I'm charging this sucker out.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.920]   Oh, this is going to be exciting.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.920]   I got it.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.440]   I have an old nano that I just plugged in.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.280]   The version one, which I guess I'm expecting my $25.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.000]   You see that there's a $25 settlement?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.920]   We all get $25 back if we bought generation one.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   You get it.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   You get $0.21 cents.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   The lawyers get--
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.720]   Well, the lawyers, the lawyers, the ones-- anytime you see these big settlements where
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.480]   we all get a $15 check or a $25 check, you know that the lawyers walked away with $10
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   million.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.360]   And basically, by the way, less than 17% of those are claimed.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.840]   But if everybody does, it's like $4 million to Apple.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:58.040]   But they're not-- like I said, you look at the history of these things, less than 17%
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.720]   people in general, not specifically to any particular product.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.960]   Less than 17% will actually do the work because you got to assume that they still live where
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.040]   they lived and we're a very mobile society now.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040]   I mean, it's--
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.520]   It would be the first-- if you had a first generation nano that was the scratch-- it was
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   the scratch-- by the way, look how scratch the front of mine--
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   It was the scratch.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   Mine's all scratch.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.360]   That was my favorite, yeah.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.360]   But if I wasn't watching video, I just didn't care.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.360]   Yeah, I knew it.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   That was the whole thing.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   All right.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   It didn't become important until I was watching video.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.880]   Well, it says, "Do not disconnect.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   It's charging up."
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   It's doing its thing.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   Look at that.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   I forgot this even existed.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.040]   Oh, updating library on Ibis iPod.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   Uh-oh.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   That's not what I want.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.760]   I gave this to my daughter.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.360]   That's what a terrible father I am.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.040]   I gave my sister for one.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Here, honey.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.280]   Here, have an iPod.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.480]   Well now we know what's going to be on here.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   It's going to be ABBA.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.920]   All right, let me just see.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   ABBI's iPod.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   What's on it?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   There's nothing like ABBA.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   It wants me to update to version 1.5.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.480]   Now, with upper and lower case and song titles.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.560]   Listen, listen.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   This is what's on it.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   This is great.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   I'm so excited.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   Wow.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   Nice to see you.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   OK, now, now that Rick, Ashley, and ABBA have been played on this.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   Well, this thing even has ID3 tags.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.560]   This is amazing.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   I think we might want to just memorize this moment at 12 noon on this day.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   This is when we jump the chart.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   In the year of our Lord, January 27, 2009.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.560]   Back, break, weekly, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   Jump the chart.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   You remember this.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   This is when you're in high school.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   Everybody now.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   Everybody now.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   He was his boy.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   She was a girl.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   Can I make it anymore?
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   Well, when I want to drive my kids crazy, I'll start singing.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   He was a boy.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   She was a girl.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   They got--
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   [GRUNTING]
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.560]   Stop.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.560]   Stop.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   Well, we now know what my kids were listening to in--
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560]   When was this?
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.560]   This was 2002.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   2002?
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   You know what's really bad is those oldies, which are way newer than anything eyelid.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   No, they're really not that old.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   Wow.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   Oh, no.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.560]   See?
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   I have your attention, please.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   I'm doing this for Justine.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   You didn't have your attention.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   It's memory lane for her.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   Will the real Slim Shady please stop.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   Is this a junior prom?
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   I did not know.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   You didn't go.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   I went to a land party.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   Oh, man.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   You just gained immense cred in my eyes.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.560]   You went to a land party instead of prom?
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   I did.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   Yes.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   My junior year played a little quick, a little one real tournament.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   Oh, but your gown was still fantastic.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   Did you wear a gown?
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   I did.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560]   I didn't, actually.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   That would be funny.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   It would be funny.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   It would have been amazing.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   A little wrist corsage.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.560]   We call it land tie prom.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.560]   It was a lot of fun, actually.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.560]   It was so cool.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   At that point, it wasn't the cool thing to do.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   No.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   But now it is.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   I life is here.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   I life has entered the building.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   All right.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   Look at this just in time.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   So Apple now is two for two in not screwing us.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   They did the iPhone update before the show was off the year.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   Oh, they're three for three, my friend.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560]   Really?
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   What else did they do not do?
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   You have not mentioned perhaps the most important news of the day.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   This is just breaking over the wire.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   Apple releases IDVD 7.0.3.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   You know, I've heard of this thing called a DVD.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.200]   I guess it was something they used to use to put, they had plastic and they would put
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.560]   media on the plastic.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   See, I got the family pack.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   I want to show you what a good person I am.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   Sure, I could buy one copy and install it on 400 machines.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   But no, I spent an extra 20 bucks, got the family pack before I installed it on 400.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   And you know what's great about this?
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   You know what's great about this?
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   You do not have to type in the serial number for the phone.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   I have a serial number for the first time ever.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   Oh, no, no, it's I work.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   I work because I like never needed a serial number.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   That's right.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   I work.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   I didn't have to, but I was thinking maybe it was a new one.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.560]   But wait a minute, I installed I work in an S for the serial number.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.560]   But you downloaded it, right?
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   No, if you buy it from the store, they know that you have the hardware.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   Oh, that's good.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   And so they know you installed it now.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.560]   What I haven't tested is that what they do with Final Cut, which I think makes a lot of
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:25.680]   sense is that they just don't let you run two copies on, you know, two that you didn't
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.680]   buy.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.320]   If you don't have, like, for instance, the family pack or whatever, you know, well, with
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.400]   Final Cut, if you have two copies of the same serial number on the same network on the
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   land, right?
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.120]   So it could theoretically save those licenses or license, but not having to, that makes
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   total sense.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   Don't have a serial number.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.920]   Don't run two copies at the same time.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.120]   But if you can install in every machine, if it's just, but that's you need it, you have
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.120]   a family pack, it'll run.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Which I think would be a five-can-one.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   It would be a totally reasonable five-can-run at the same time.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.720]   Let's not encourage serial numbers.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.720]   We don't need them.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.160]   Oh, what I'm saying is that you didn't do the same with this model.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.360]   You wouldn't need any serial numbers.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   No, I know.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   And this is actually Microsoft.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.360]   That's the way it makes sense.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.760]   Did that with Microsoft Office Mac, where would you get on the family pack or the student
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.560]   pack, whatever you'd get, I think three or four serial numbers.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.840]   And if you had, which was really smart, because now you've got three copies, right?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.880]   If you had the same copy running twice, it would then say, no, sorry, it's already running.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.040]   You can only run three serial numbers simultaneously.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.080]   It was, I think that's a very good model.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.480]   Yeah, I've always wondered, you know, they're so smart at these places, why aren't they
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.400]   smart enough to figure out how to do this without making me type in 128 numbers?
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.320]   Well, now you don't.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.800]   Ilife09, oh, baby.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.880]   By the way, I just exported my first photograph from iPhoto to Flickr.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   It went flawlessly.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.160]   Oh, so you've actually used it now?
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   I photo-flick.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.320]   And I want that, you know what I'm really interested is the face recognition particularly
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.080]   in the case I just tested it.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.400]   I love the idea that it integrates with Facebook.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   That's kind of cool.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   Now here's the thing.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.160]   I used my old, unfortunately dearly departed dog Pete as a test and even recognized him.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   It works with dogs?
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   Yep.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   It's not supposed to.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   It's kind of good.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.320]   I don't know why I only had to pretend.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.880]   No, because I thought it was using the nose, the eyes and the mouth and the cat-
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   Dogs have those eyes and mouth.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   They do.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.880]   They do.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.840]   We don't know who this is, but man, is he ugly.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.280]   All my friends who don't want to get tagged on Facebook aren't going to enjoy this.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.120]   Damn, that's a big nose.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.480]   The scary thing.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.760]   I had three photographs.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   And they found them?
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   And they found it.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.240]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.600]   It works.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.680]   And I just did the places thing and that works.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.960]   It put me, when it doesn't, it has a pop-up that starts to give you some suggestions as
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   you type.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.200]   But if you're at a place that doesn't recognize, you just type it in and it goes to Google
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.520]   and says, "Oh, is this it?"
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.320]   And sure enough, there it is on the map.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.520]   Someone said to title this Mac Break episode, "Dogs Have Eyes and Nose and a Mouth."
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.640]   You learn something every show, isn't it?
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.480]   You learn on Mac Break Break.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   Really?
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.040]   I don't know.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.040]   So let's see, register online later.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.560]   Okay, so it's going through the install.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.840]   So by the time we're done, we'll have an install here.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.680]   Before we go to our picks of the week, any other stories, there's so many stories this
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.960]   week.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.240]   I just got through telling you, guys, this just blew me off.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   I knew it'd be 7.33.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.600]   Doesn't that come with this?
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.160]   That's a separate download.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.880]   I mean, it doesn't come with the latest IDVD.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.960]   They've updated it the day it comes out.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.960]   Steven.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.280]   Well, it must have made some bad mistake.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.960]   Another thing is that there's this brewing thing that's happening between Palm and Apple,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   right?
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.960]   Oh, yeah, the tree.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.960]   Over the multitouch.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   So Apple yesterday was awarded the patent for multitouch.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.960]   Right.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.120]   And it's a pretty deep patent.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.600]   It's not like a one-page patent.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.480]   It is like everything you could do with two fingers.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:48.520]   It surprises me because I thought that the multitouch was kind of open because that guy
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.040]   from Carnegie Mellon demonstrated it, Ted, and all of that.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.480]   The question is, when did Apple apply?
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.720]   I mean, good, years ago, did they apply it before?
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.520]   It's not like they applied for it last week and got it.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.000]   They could have applied years ago.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.520]   They just got it through the process.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:05.560]   It's been approved, which depending on how the patent office looks at it, could be a
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.600]   real problem for the Palm pre.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   Because it's pre-uses multitouch.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.760]   It's using the same technology.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.000]   It literally could shut the whole thing.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.160]   I hate to see that because I want to see some competition in this space, don't you?
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.080]   Yeah, I definitely want to check it out.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   The pre looked really cool.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.080]   Did you look at CES?
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   We're able to touch it.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   I actually didn't get to see it now.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   I'm very, very sad.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.440]   But I'm nice to love my trio.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.680]   I just loved it.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   I love the Palm OS.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:31.120]   It was the first, you know, in fact, the story of Palm is that Apple had this thing called
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   the Newton.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.360]   They left out some critical features like desktop syncing.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.720]   Palm comes along, makes handwriting work with graffiti, does desktop syncing, and the Newton's
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720]   gone.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   There were probably eight apples.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.320]   The Newton was also the wrong formula.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   Too big.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   Too big.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.640]   I mean, I love the Newton, but the Palm pilot was everything the Newton wanted to be.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:56.440]   And so I hope Apple doesn't shut Palm down on this one.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.600]   I'm sure they'll try.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.800]   That's probably probably the point of the patent.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.280]   Yeah, that's why you...
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   And they have to.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.320]   I mean, as Scott has pointed out before, once they have a patent, the issue is that if someone...
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.480]   They can't just say, "Oh, it's okay."
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.560]   They have to either license it to Palm or tell Palm to stop using it.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.440]   But they can't just turn the other...
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.720]   According to Agathon in our chatroom, the patent was submitted September 2006, which
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.400]   is considerably later than that multi-touch demo that we all saw.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.600]   No, we saw those two hands too.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   That's true.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   It wasn't with things.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   Yeah, it wasn't with things.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   Well, there was a pinch.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   No, was there a pinch?
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.360]   You know, the Madden office has a history of not looking at prior art very closely.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.520]   And not watching Ted.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.600]   No one from the Patton office goes to Ted, as you can see.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   Apparently not.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:44.160]   And I have decided to patent the middle finger being rolled up in a special salute.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.040]   I think he's had rolled down and I'm trying to do this thing.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.120]   I don't know what that is.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.800]   All right.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.480]   Any other stories, last chance going?
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.320]   Oh, there is a new software update.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:04.640]   It is the iLife Media Browser, which improves overall stability and addresses a number of
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:10.760]   other minor issues recommended for all users of Aputure, iLife, iWork, and Mac OS, 10.5.6
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.920]   Leopard or later.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.520]   So these are all, you know, they've pressed the disc.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.920]   They must have pressed it a couple of weeks ago in order to get it into the stores by
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   now.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.280]   So these are just things they found after.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:24.760]   And it might be stuff that had to come this way as opposed to on the disc as well.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   Right.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.120]   But that's what's going on.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.080]   Mark Papermaster has got to go ahead to go to work at the iPhone division of Apple.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.880]   Remember, he was the guy who came from IBM, IBM said, you can't go to work for Apple.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.680]   We've got an on compete.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.280]   Now he'll start work April 24th.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   Congratulations.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   Senior Vice President of Devices, Hardware Engineering.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.520]   Says reports to Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   I bet that's a good job, Tyler.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.600]   Just basically says manager of stuff and things.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.400]   Stuff and stuff.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.600]   And then the important stuff and things because it made IBM very upset.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   All right.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.440]   We're going to get our picks of the week here in just a second before we do that.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.440]   I've got to pick for you.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:18.000]   I've got the audible pick of the week audible.com/macbreaksplace2go to get your gold subscription.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.920]   That gives you a book a month.

[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:28.560]   even if you decide not to stick around, you know, if you say, yeah, this wasn't for me,
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   you won't say that.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.280]   But if you do, you got to keep the book.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   Here's what you do.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.800]   You go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.200]   Now when you go there and you sign up, I'm going to tell you there's another free book

[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.480]   We've got a special Twit free book before I do that.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.120]   I'm going to give you all a chance to make an audible.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   Do you listen to audible?
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   I never asked you, Justin.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.280]   Are you listening to audio books at all?
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   You're probably two young.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   Maybe I should start.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.960]   I think because when you're spending a lot of time on buses.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   Yeah, I know.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.960]   I'm starting.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   It's anything.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   But there's no better way to get used to the fact that the bag lady next to you is either
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.000]   passed out or dead.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.360]   We won't even talk about who was next to me today.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   Really?
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   Who was next to you?
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.360]   I just, you raised the conversation.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   You raised the conversation.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   Oh, because you're on the 80.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   Yeah, I didn't know what was going on.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   The crazy people.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.560]   You have to get on the 70, 74, which is the X-73, too.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.360]   Well, Alex, you didn't tell me.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   No, you can't.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.160]   You told me 511.org and I typed in and it told me what I needed to do.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.160]   Oh, the crazy people.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.080]   I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   Help.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   It's the crazy bus.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.680]   So I'm going to go check out some of the books you should because you put in the headphones
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.880]   and they think you're busy.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.880]   And then you don't believe.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.560]   It's so easily an awkward way to have voices inside your head as you're riding the bus.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   Love it.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.920]   You have a book for us, Mr. Inletko?
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.400]   Yes, I do.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:52.320]   I have a very special inspirational volume and these trying troubling times when we're
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:58.240]   looking for a lamp unto our feet, so to speak, in these dark, dark ways.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.840]   Ms. Carrie Fisher has a memoir of how much freaking and she did over the past 20 years
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.200]   while she became a superstar.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.560]   I love this book.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.440]   It's called, first of all, okay.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:17.560]   Oftentimes you pick up these celebrity biographies because, okay, I just wanted to find out how
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.440]   remorseful Tony Curtis he is for all the people that he slept with between the rears
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.200]   1951 and 1963 inclusive.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.760]   But then the Carrie Fisher is actually a very, very good novelist.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.280]   She wrote a fake memoir and titled postcards from the edge.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   Which is great.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.360]   And it's a great movie with Shirley MacLaine.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   I love that.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   Exactly.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.120]   I mean, you could tell it's like, you know, you don't have to be like a celebrity gossip
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.880]   person to realize, oh, that person is actually her mother.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.880]   Yes.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.880]   That sort of stuff.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.960]   She's actually talking about her real life.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:54.240]   It is, let's say that it is an efficiently and efficiently told tale.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.120]   It's unabridged and unabridged.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.840]   It's at three hours and eight minutes, but still.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.680]   You kind of love the cover though.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   Did you see the cover?
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.360]   It's essentially princess.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:08.800]   It's princess layer her head down with like sort of a sloppy martini glass in her right
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   hand.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:17.480]   Yeah, there's books like this really as someone who occasionally writes books, it just sort
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.320]   of challenges me to say, do not even consider getting into publishing unless you can get
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   a cover as good as that.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.720]   Because you know, I just want to buy that book just based on that.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.800]   Can we just listen a little bit?
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   This is Carrie.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   Carrie reads it herself.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   Yes.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   Another reason for this.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   And I didn't know she was 19 when she became princess Leia.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   Wow.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   She was young.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   So she was also, it was also like half British.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.320]   She'd like, she'd been in boarding school for like three or four years.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.240]   That's why her accent kind of tails up and down.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.680]   Oh, that explains it.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:51.880]   Because Eddie Fisher was not known for his his cultured accent or his fidelity.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.320]   Nor for that matter was Debbie Reynolds.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   Here we go.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:00.800]   I understood that my version of reality had a tendency to set me apart from others.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.960]   And when you're young, you want to fit in.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.520]   Hell, I still want to fit in with certain humans.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.920]   But as you get older, you get a little more discriminating.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.360]   Well, my parents were professionally committed to sticking out.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.880]   So all too frequently, I found myself sticking out right along with them.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:26.440]   And before anybody like emails or Twitter's, I acknowledge the hypocrisy of 45 minutes
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.640]   ago complaining about the Mac rumors market becoming more like entertainment gossip and
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.320]   then recommending a book that's like stars talking about their drinking.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   I acknowledge that.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   These are stars.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.320]   Not this.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   It's a good thing.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.800]   It's just one of those, you know, there have been times when I wanted to like really
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:49.400]   immerse myself on a great novel, you know, you just want to immerse yourself and great
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.320]   culture and great, great classics.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.800]   Then you want to know, okay, did you actually like get it on with Harrison Ford or do you
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:59.680]   just make out a little, you know, and so and I have not gotten that far.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   As a matter of fact, I bought, I bought the currently neither has Harrison.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   No, sorry.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.520]   I was in my own conversational space.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.600]   I did not fully parse your comment.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.640]   And I've been, and I've been in full listening mode.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.560]   I would have chuckled appreciatively at that.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.240]   Thank you for the delayed chocolate.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.640]   That was both funny and fast.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:26.120]   You are doing, I'll give you one Amazon credit of the pile that I'm coming, I got coming
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   to me in the next 30 days.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120]   That's what she said.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.480]   So this is our pick of the week and a good, I think it's a handy good choice.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.200]   Now it's going on my wish list.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   That's another thing I love.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   This is, it has a Netflix style list system.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.080]   So you know, I'm looking here, Carrie Fisher, wishful drinking, gotta listen to that.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.680]   So right here, I could just, I could just add it to my wish list.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.000]   I press the button.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.720]   You can see I've already got some books on my wish list.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.440]   So now the next time I get some credits, I can, I will just have a list of the books
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.200]   that I am trying to keep track of.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.640]   Very nice Netflix style kind of queuing.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   I love it.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640]   I love Audible.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:10.960]   BLE.com. Listen to your books. There are 51,000 titles fiction, nonfiction science fiction.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.360]   I'm listening to a book that you I think you recommended Andy some time ago was on my wishlist,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.200]   the team of rivals. And it's just boy, what a Daris Kernscon is going to do.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:28.000]   It's such a good book. The story of Lincoln and the Republican nomination in 1860, and the battle,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.560]   and then bringing his rivals into the cabinet. It's just, it just brings it alive. There's
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.720]   so much good listening. Way ahead and got that one based on that recommendation. I'm about halfway
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.960]   through it. Isn't it good? I love Doris Kernscon. I feel like, you know, one of the things I like
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.240]   to listen to the nonfiction, I mix it up. You know, I just read a fiction book, you know, Neil
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.320]   Gaiman book, by the way, Neil Gaiman's a Newbury award winner is on here as well, if you want to
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:57.040]   get there was great was graveyard. The graveyard book. Yeah. So what a week he's having. He was
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.440]   he was blogging about how he finally had a he was in the hotel after the last day of doing the
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.000]   press junk and could promote like the latest movie based on his book. Do we told that he won
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.520]   basically one of the most prestigious awards and fiction that there is and graveyard book is also
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.440]   like, you know, actually climbing up on the New York Times best. That was great book. It's a
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.640]   juvenile, but it's adults love it. It's a great book. It's like, it's a success beyond envy. It's
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.160]   like, well, I'd be sort of envious as someone who's like a little bit more successful. It's like,
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.040]   my God, I hope he gets nominated for an Oscar like next week. They still, they recount something
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.480]   say, you know, we decide we're going to give him a little game of special Oscar because
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.880]   everyone wants to have a week that's that just over the top ridiculously good.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:43.440]   But he's a genuinely nice guy. And you say you he's one of those people where you just glad for
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.200]   his success. You know, it's like he deserves it. He's been so good for so long and he's getting
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.880]   the recognition he deserves. And that's just you just feel good. What is the movie that they're
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:58.000]   making? Coraline. It's a that's Tim Burton. Do they stop most? And even that book, it's, you know,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.120]   I mean, can't wait. The damn thing is he writes these children's books that you just read,
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.760]   read as adults. And you're like, I've read like serious John Updike books. I did not enjoy one
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.440]   half as well as, you know, he's a wonderful writer. Yeah. Awesome. So awesome. He's definitely
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.400]   if it is if his name is on it, I'm buying it period. So you can also get Neil Gaiman. Lots of it
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.880]   on Audible dot usually him reading his own stuff and like carry with your her own stuff. That's
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.280]   that's something you want to watch. She sounds like she's had a few camels and a couple of
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.880]   things. There's some credibility in that voice. And then the chair is then comes up to me.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.080]   It says, what's that on your head? Our pick of the week, wishful drinking,
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.160]   Carrie Fisher, great book says I can't wait to listen to that one. Audible dot com slash
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.840]   Mac break. We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly. Now it's time for
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.440]   the most popular feature we do on Mac break weekly. People look forward to this.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.560]   They sit through the entire Blathery first hour just to get to this point. Either that or they
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.680]   fast forward a head to it. You actually don't say anything about that. Okay. That under your hat.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:09.120]   It's our picks of the week. And I'm going to start. I never start. I'm going to start. I'm going to
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.800]   start today. And you know, I have a WordPress blog. You know, I know you're a big blogger,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:21.280]   Justine. And I use Mars at it and Daniel, Daniel Jalkut is a friend of the show and we love Red
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.560]   sweater software. And I do love his program. But I got to say there is a new blogging tool.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.360]   Have you seen blog? Oh, yet I haven't. Are you your WordPress? Right? Yes. I'm a
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:41.440]   B L O G O is fan tabulous. It is. I'm going to say I've said this before. It's in that delicious
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:50.480]   generation of great Mac programs. It's beautiful. It just really looks good. It's it's it's it
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.360]   works really nicely. He's with it. You know, he's, for instance, he's got ubiquity commands on his
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.760]   page. I need any page where you go there and ubiquity says, Oh, there's new commands. And we took
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:08.400]   it down. We did we already? I can't get to it. It's Louise. Oh, the wonders of a live show. The
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.640]   one the wonders of a live show. Well, it's it's drink brain juice.com. It's got the cutest little
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:19.840]   there we go. I just low drink brain juice.com. So blog out to is out 1.2. I'm sorry.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.760]   I'll tell a couple of things I really like about it. Handles media very nicely, very easy to drag
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:32.160]   and drop pictures in there. It has a built in thumbnail maker. You can decide you could say
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.000]   it actually reads your template. So it knows how wide the posts can be. So you could say, you know,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.760]   I want it as big as it can be without going. Have you ever put a thumbnail a picture in there?
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.160]   Yeah, wraps around the whole thing. This way it never is too big. It it has all sorts of really
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.200]   sweet features you can post in it being under like right a whole bunch of stuff and have it.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:58.320]   Complete scheduling. In fact, very nicely simple interface for scheduling. I am just I've become
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:05.920]   a huge fan of Blago. It is again is from drink brain juice.com. Now here's another nice thing.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.440]   You know, it's a new, you know, relatively new program. It crashed on me. And I was in the I had
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.000]   just finished a long post. I thought, Oh, great. Now I got to do the whole thing again. Reopened it.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.240]   The whole post was there. I hadn't saved it. It just keeps track of it as you go. That's really cool.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.360]   Really good. It uses previews that are directly from your CSS. It downloads the CSS. So the
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:31.360]   previews exactly as it can look feature after feature in here. I'm in your right. I can't get to the
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:39.200]   one. We completely broken it. It's coming. It's very slow. It's just of course they have all these
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.240]   screen captures which I'm not sure everyone's looking at right now. Yeah, that's probably what
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.760]   image is. Yeah. It's it's just a really sweet program. I don't remember how much it is. Can you
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:54.560]   see how much the I think it's $25? $25 to buy. I got a nice note when I purchased it from its author.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.640]   Just just very impressed handles tags and categories for WordPress very well. Very into it. It integrates
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.880]   into WordPress very easily. Well, not just WordPress. You know, WordPress uses a standard API that
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:14.480]   blogger uses and type pad uses. I think it works with most blogs. Actually, got the idea from
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:21.200]   from this from the guy who does slash message, Stoboid, he uses this. And I saw him on friend feed
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:26.480]   noting that he'd use blog on. I thought, Oh, I should try this. It is a very, very slick piece of
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.560]   software. Big buttons. If you don't like big buttons, you might not like it. The user interface is
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:38.720]   prominent. It's definitely it's definitely made for movie use. Yeah, it's Web 2.0. You got you
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.160]   got to make sure that everybody in the audience knows exactly what that kid is doing on his
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.240]   computer. So you always have the big button that says, just like that. Next button. So you set a
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.080]   post. Yeah, it does look like that, doesn't it? It has a login. Yes. It takes up the entire page.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.160]   But I love Tumblr. Don't you love Tumblr? I went back to Tumblr. You know, lots of fan.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.000]   That's not such a big fan of that. Not a big Tumblr fan. I went back because they have new
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.240]   themes and stuff. And I'm really liking the new stuff, the new dashboard. Anyway, that's my pick.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.280]   Blogo, B-L-O-G-O. I like the bunny with the glasses. Drink brain juice is a good name for a company.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:19.040]   All of these are enough to make me a fan. And I paid for it. That's my pick of the week.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.280]   Now, Miss Justine, it should have let you go first because it is ladies first. No, no, it's fine.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.960]   You know, I'm not a big Mac app person other than using, you know, like the Adobe suite and
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.640]   Final Cut. So I mean, that's really the only apps that I use. But now we're talking apps,
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.800]   iPhone apps, you can talk iPhone apps. How many pages of iPhone apps do you have?
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.560]   About nine. Nine is pretty good. Ten. Yeah, that's pretty good. Because it's what 12 a page,
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.760]   16 a page. I got a lot. Let's just go with that. So I guess, I mean, obviously, the emoji icons
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.280]   huge fan. So I mean, that's going to be my pick, but I also have another little secret one.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.960]   So the app is Frosty app. It's the app that we're talking about earlier. By the way,
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.520]   you can delete it. Yeah, you can delete it. It wants it activates. You're good to go. It's 99 cents.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:05.440]   It's in the app store. Download it and install those emoji icons. Play with it. And if you go
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.240]   to tastyblogsnack.com or iJustine.com, you have a post with screenshots and everything. That's
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.440]   what I did. I went to your site and I followed your instructions. And then there's this other
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:19.280]   fun game, which I strayed from purchasing from the iTunes store. It's called Sally's Salon.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.400]   I'm telling you, you're going to think I'm crazy. I refuse to download this, but it is an
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.040]   obsessively addictive game. No, it's not weird. Like your hairdresser, isn't it? You are. You're
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.800]   a hairdresser. You hire people. I'm telling you once you start playing this, you're going to be
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.920]   like, wow, you're right. And if I'm wrong, sorry, it's not on the iTunes app store. It is. No,
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:44.400]   isn't it? It's called Sally's Salon. So you play with a little hairdresser and you go around and
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.200]   you try to make as much money as you can and you have to hire people. I only have eight pages of
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.080]   apps, so I'm going to have to get going here. I clearly haven't. I'm not up to Justine Stamps.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.760]   It's a pretty fun app, I promise. Sally's Salon. Yes. And you're the business owner.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.360]   Yes. And you hire people and you just have to try to make sure that there's people not in the
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.880]   waiting room too long. So I mean, there's a little bit of strategy. I like that kind of where you're
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.480]   running a business. It's like real-time strategy. It's pretty fun. It's great for bus rides.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.000]   It's only a buck. I know. Great for bus rides. I love how all of the iTunes apps,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.080]   they're always on sale. No matter what it is, everyone's like, oh, 99 cent sale. And it's on sale
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.480]   pretty much for the rest of its lifetime on the store. They're doing that with all of the games from
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.160]   it's the people who do Enigma and all of those. They're all 99 cents now. That's such a good
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.320]   price point. You know what? I don't think they could probably make much money because Apple takes
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.360]   what 30 cents and then they're making 60 cents a game. So I doubt they're making much money,
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.960]   but boy, it sure is nice for us end users. Yeah. There's a lot of talk about that. There's a lot
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.880]   of, there's been some talk about people saying, well, you know, we're losing what we could get
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.560]   if we people were paying a little bit more for the application. But when I, and I have to admit,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.760]   I think about we're working on a bunch of apps and there's some apps that we're looking at that
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.920]   may cost a fair bit of money because they're really, really niche products for the, for the iPhone,
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.840]   for professionals. But a lot of the stuff that we're thinking about is 99 to maybe up to 299
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.960]   because you just wanted to be one of those things people just kind of flick the wrist and,
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.520]   and buy. But that also does affect how many hours you calculate. You calculate if a thousand
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.560]   people downloaded, you know, or 10,000 people downloaded over six months. Am I going to really
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.400]   get any money out of this? I mean, a lot of these apps too aren't making their money off of downloads.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.880]   It's more the, the advertising. So I didn't sell these salon right now. It's, it's pretty fun. I'm
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.600]   sorry. I've been playing it for like two days straight. I'm not proud. I made it to Hollywood
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.960]   finally. Oh, so excited. Oh, like you're a Hollywood. You're, you're like a stylist to the stars. Yes.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.760]   It's fun. Okay. I can play or play survival. Survival's like the cut through mode. Should I
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.640]   play survival? How do you play? You can, you can play survival. It just gives you a good little
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:54.080]   taste of what it would really be like. Yes. As a, as a cosmetologist. Good. All right. I'm
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.960]   going to play survival mode. It's fun guys. I promise. Sally. So like, hey, it's cute. I like this.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.360]   It's fun. I says, don't let a single customer leave. Oh, that's why it's survival mode. Yes.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.520]   Anybody leaves the shop. What do I, what do I got? Oh, she's, she wants to go to the bathroom.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.800]   Oh, wait a minute. Oh my God. Oh, okay. Alex, quick. What's your pick?
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   Save us from Sally. So my pick is something that, that Alutha in our office started to use. And,
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   and it is a, and I went away from it because I was looking at the brain juice. Hold on. It is,
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:34.960]   it is called Roo Switch. So this is by rubasoft.com and I make sure I got to the page before I set it
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:42.400]   because otherwise we'll, we'll get locked up a little bit. So it's rubasoft.com. It's R-O-O-B-A-S-O-F-T
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.800]   dot com. And it's called Roo Switch. And what it does is it allows you to shuffle your settings
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.880]   around so you can have multiple preference settings. So you have a couple people, you're working on
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.760]   beta testing or you're working on, if you have a couple different people using the machine and
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.240]   they like it to be set up a different way, all of this stuff can be switched behind. Now what I'm
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.840]   using it for, what I'm building it into the system for right now is, so I have a lot of photos. I
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   have some of them on my laptop that I like to have on my laptop. Their example files like for my
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.160]   iPhoto library, that's just like example files for presentations or my aperture library has a lot
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:19.920]   of the heavier stuff. But what I want is I want on my iPhoto library of my personal stuff,
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.200]   what I want on my, what I want there is I want it to look at my iPhoto collection
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.880]   when I'm traveling. But I want to look at an external drive as my iPhoto collection when I'm
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.680]   at home. Yeah. Somebody called me an S-preferences. Somebody called me an S-preferences.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.840]   Do that on the radio show. Exactly. This allows you to set those preferences. So you simply go boom
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.760]   and you switch over and now it switches over to another, it switches over to it. This is the
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.680]   preferences now and you don't have to go in and re-link it or pull it out. And so
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.760]   that's what this allows you to do is switch between those types of things. The library,
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.080]   the preferences, the setup, everything can be moved back and forth. Like for instance, when I,
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.160]   there's a one presentation I do in Photoshop that requires me to switch to
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.520]   nearest neighbor for scaling and you never want to have that set unless you're doing that
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.400]   presentation. And so I do it and then I can't figure out why everything's getting chunky when
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.760]   I'm bringing it down. And so having something like this allows me to switch to that to the
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.520]   presentation and then switch back when I'm not doing it using it. It's $14, $15, $14.95.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.960]   So it's not very expensive. And so far from our initial testing, Alutha has been,
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.480]   loves it. He's been using it for everything. I've just started using it and I really like it. So
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.480]   Rusewitch, I'm sorry. I'm busy washing hair. I always,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.200]   because of it. You've got a massage in that. When you're washing hair, the massage,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.240]   the back of the neck. I pick bangs and she's really unhappy about it. Oh, you have, yeah,
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:45.120]   you have to pick the smelly face and you can't, you can't grow up bangs. It takes forever. So
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.560]   I'm really missed. And then I gave somebody a puzzle for the visual quick start guide on this.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.240]   I am. I'm telling you, it's honestly addicting the visual quick start guide to Sally Salon.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.560]   Now, remember you want to, you'll want to talk about boys during the set in the
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.720]   rinse, but not during the shampoo because that's rude. Oh man. Oh, I haven't lost a customer yet,
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.760]   but all the chairs are full quick pick a style golden honey, horizon blue. Oh, see if it's gorgeous.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.040]   She smiles. Oh, she wanted lilac blossom, a radiant. Yeah. Now Andy Anaco is going to give
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:24.640]   us a pick while I lather up some more women. Oh, baby. Yes. It's a different kind of salon.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.760]   Sorry. I thought I'd give that comment a little bit of air around it.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.520]   Finally, somebody who gets my, myself, my, oh, go ahead, Danny. Okay. Well,
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:45.520]   I am a professional writer. So as a result, I spend a lot of times looking at a document window
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.000]   until it flips into the screen saver. So for that reason, screen savers are a big part of my
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.920]   computational, my computational forum there. So I'm just going to recommend a really cool one that I
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:07.120]   found the other day, the moving photos 3D saver. It's at David McNerny.com David MC N E R N E Y.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.280]   And what it does, it takes any folder that's pictures folder that you happen to mention.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.160]   And in screen saver, it will just simply build a really cool house of cards out of all those photos
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.920]   and rotate it and fly through it in 3D. And that's really all it does. So you'll, again,
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.040]   you'll be like on the phone. And at some point, you're seeing this really cool, awesome cityscape
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.080]   being built with like all your vacation photos and like all the comic book previews, covers that
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.920]   you downloaded from New Zorama and all the stuff that you took off your eyesight and all that sort
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.600]   of stuff. And by the time it's finished building, you're like, wow, what an odd little world that
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.080]   these people live in. But it's, it's a, it's a great demonstration of like how much horsepower
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.960]   is like sort of lurking there inside every CPU. It almost feels like you're unworthy of saying,
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.000]   gee, all I keep doing is typing keys and having those keys turn into letters on the screen. It's
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.160]   almost as if this computer has gotten bored with like so little to do that it has to actually
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:08.080]   make up these really complicated projects to do on its own. And it is a free screen saver. So it's
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:14.560]   so it's zero zero zero free free free. And again, again, the name is it's called moving photos 3D.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.560]   They also have just plain moving photos, which is cool, but kind of like, it's like just
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.080]   shuffling cards sort of thing. But this is like, wow, this is pretty cool looking. I have to say,
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   I'm going to download this. Wait, wait, see it in motion. The screenshot on the, on that, on that
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.320]   site just shows you like a static picture of it. But it actually rotates all around and you can
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.880]   fly through. Cool. And it does it from your eye photo. Does it right from my phone?
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:43.280]   It was a little bit, it was a little bit weird because I had it on my iMac first and all my
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.920]   pictures are on my Drobo, not on like the internal drive, but I happened to choose the pictures folder.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:54.240]   So for like the first night, all it was doing was taking the 12 images that I scanned off a
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.560]   recent copy of issue of Wonder Woman and three photos I took with my eyesight when I'm trying
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.360]   to get a self worker going. So it looked like the most obsessed Gail Simone fan thing ever.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.720]   Well, there's not, not that there's anything wrong with that. If you're being obsessed with
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.480]   the comp book writer, Gail Simone would be high on the list. She's there you go. She has many
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.400]   qualities. Last but not least, Mr. Scottborn.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.480]   Well, I think I did a free pick last week, didn't I? Yes.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.200]   So I'm going to go the other direction. Spend us some money.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.560]   Yes, I've spent $2,000. This is 22, Alex's.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:37.360]   Wait a minute. What are we buying a Tesla? What is it? It's 22, Alex's. It's the second most
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:45.200]   expensive iPhone accessory I can think of. Is it made of solid gold? Nope. It's a Mamiya DL 28
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:53.440]   medium format. 28 megapixel camera for $15,000. But here's where the iPhone comes in.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.760]   This little sucker, if anybody familiar with the concept of tethered shooting,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:04.640]   you can control this leaf back on the Mamiya DL 28 with your iPhone.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.800]   How long is that? Really? Wow. You can control it. Now, wait, gets better. You see as you press the
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.160]   little button on your iPhone, on your iPhone, you take the picture that the DL 28 fires, you see
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.840]   the photo come up on your iPhone. You can even do stuff to it on your iPhone.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.440]   Wow. Is this using Wi-Fi? How does it do that? I do not know.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.520]   Magic. It's easy to match. So I have to pause, Sally, salon, or can I?
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:37.600]   It's in beta right now. They're going to show it to me on March 2nd at the sneak peek at PMA in
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.880]   Las Vegas. I'm going to get to play with it. But it's 15 grand. That's a lot of money. But this is a
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.240]   very high-end camera for pros. It comes with a back, two lenses in the body, and you have to buy
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:55.280]   your own iPhone. But 15 brands, they cannot give you a $200 iPhone or iPhone touch.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.160]   But this is like the iPhone remote, which I love for my Apple TV. It makes sense when you've got a
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.640]   little computer like this in a great UI. We predicted that we're going to be stuff like this coming
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.080]   out. And the Miya DL 28 is the first thing to do it. So last week I went free. This week,
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:17.280]   I'm at 22 Alex's. Next week, I'll go down a little. So your average right now is 11 Alex's.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.760]   If you're only looking at the last two. So it turns out that it turns out 11 Alex's is now a Scott.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.200]   Yeah. I like it. All right. We've got a new unit and Alex is 700 bucks roughly the cost of
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:36.880]   Photoshop. $7,700 is a Scott. That's half of what I'm recommending today.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.040]   Right. So it's two Scott's. Two Scott's now. Now, now if it turns out, if you put something
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:52.240]   that's 10 Scott's, then that's a great Scott. I like it. If you recommend a Lamborghini that
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:59.440]   holds that happens to hold. It happens to hold an iPod. Then that would be three great Scott's.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:05.520]   I think I already recommended my R three 50 Mercedes as the most expensive iPhone
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.880]   accessory. So that would be a great that would be two great Scott's or one great Scott.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.400]   Well, about 80 K whatever that's that's a that's about a great Scott.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.560]   But but this is more practical to 15,000 our camera and I would I would submit that those who are
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.000]   buying the D three X, you know, for about double that price, they could step up to this and it
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.480]   wouldn't be that big a stretch to get something in this in this format. Although for me as a wildlife
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.080]   photographer, it's not that attractive. Thank God. Cause I'd probably be buying one otherwise.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.640]   We had a photographer on the Tasmania adventure, Charlie Kramer, who shot that camera. I don't
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.400]   know if he's using the leaf back. He's shooting it. I think it was because there's 29 megapixel
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:48.880]   mamiya and a few amazing detail on those images on believable, but he basically was doing almost
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:53.840]   still lifes. Right. I mean, he's doing rock. This is the newest version of this Leo. So there's
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.280]   some new stuff here. There's a touch screen on the back of the leaf back that allows you to do a
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.800]   lot of cool things. And these cameras do where they're really special is you're looking at
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:12.240]   something that has very large sensor size sights on the sensor. The pixel size is huge. So it's
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.400]   28 megapixels, but it's 28 megapixels on something that's like three times the size of a 35 millimeter
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:24.880]   full frame sensor. So you get 12 stops of dynamic range on this thing. So you don't even like HDR,
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:30.480]   isn't it? Yeah, it's built in HDR. And it's really quite a remarkable leap when you look at cameras
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.000]   like this just a few years ago, we're in the $200,000 range. This is just one more thing that, you know,
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   two years from now, people might think that this is irrelevant today. But two years from now,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.760]   I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see these cameras come down into the three, four,
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.440]   five thousand. Oh, that would be nice. And you can think about this is, I mean, if you
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.560]   consider shooting HDRs with this, you get quite quite an image. Well, look at this is one of
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.920]   Charlie Kramer's images using using that camera. And yeah, I guarantee you, it's just one exposure,
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.480]   but the range, if you go to his website, you can see a lot of stuff using that camera. Charles
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:07.680]   Kramer, C R A M E R dot com. But anyway, I will, I will test this. Can't wait to see it, Scott. I
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.600]   just I will test this with the iPhone. I love that idea. Because that's basically what what
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.840]   model photographers do where they have the wireless connection and it goes right to the
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.840]   laptop so they could see the image on a big justine. I'm going to need a model while I'm doing
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.840]   this test. We can be available. Justine, I got a hand. Can I bring my iPhone? Stay away. Stay
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:33.200]   well away. I'll be playing Sally salon and you can use your $15,000 iPhone app and I'll be playing
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:38.640]   my 90% app. A little bit of a difference. All right, those are our picks. I, there is one thing I
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.800]   didn't mention. It's a very important thing. And I thought I'd save it for last. This is our last
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:49.520]   Saturday 24th of January was the 25th anniversary of the Macintosh. It wouldn't be a Mac break weekly
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.160]   without the Macintosh. And I thought maybe we could end the show today just with some Mac memories.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.600]   Your first Mac, Alex Lindsay, what was it? Well, my first Mac was an Apple IIe. Now, I learned
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.440]   how to program on a Franklin because it was there was actually, you know, we were Apple phones. Yeah.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.720]   And they were down there. They were first Apple. Remember my first Mac was my first well, my first
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:14.560]   Mac, my cousin had one that I played with all the time. So, but the first Mac that I actually bought
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.480]   was an Apple IIe CI. That's not a Mac. It's not a Mac. No Mac. No Mac IIe CI. I'm sorry Mac IIe CI.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.680]   Oh Mac, remember this? The FX. The CI. Yeah, those are cute. I like this.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:32.080]   And I, it was a little box. Yeah. And I had, I had, I put 122 megabytes of, of, of distriving
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:36.960]   and people thought I was insane. I was like, but I am doing audio. That's one. You know, I was like,
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.320]   you know, it's not, you know, they were like, how are you going to ever fill up 122 megabytes?
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.840]   And I was like, I am doing audio. It's probably one image from this, but me, you can't really.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:50.400]   Exactly. So, it was, it was great. We loved it. What was your first Mac, Justin? You remember?
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.560]   Well, I remember I, the first, I mean, I had Apple IIe GS. That's the first thing that I've ever
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.640]   touched. That was a really nice Apple. I remember that was a color. It was really, yeah. I used to
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.400]   print out banners and I'd be tearing that little paper. Yeah, the perf. Yeah, micro perf. Yeah.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.720]   But the first actual computer that I had was a Power Mac 6160. And I remember, I got 32 gigs of
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.160]   RAM for Christmas and a version of soft windows. I don't know if you guys remember. It was 32
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.000]   megas of RAM. 32 megas. What did I say? 30 megas. Yeah. Nowadays you get 32 gigs, but it was 32
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.520]   megas. Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't. Maybe you didn't. I don't know. 32 megas of RAM.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.440]   And I thought that the world was. Yeah, that's a lot of RAM. I had to write when I was at ILM,
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.560]   at working at ILM, I had to write a three page proposal to get 64 more megas of RAM.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.320]   And I literally made it on. This is how it changes the rendering speed of electric image.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:42.800]   Probably thousands and thousands of dollars, too. It was expensive. I don't know what it was,
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:48.240]   but it was it was. I had 128 megs and I wanted 192 and I wrote this long proposal because I
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.240]   wasn't getting it. I got it. Scott Borne, you remember your first Mac? I do very well. It was
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.720]   the Mac Plus. Yeah. That was the original form factor. Yeah, it was portable. I had a handle.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:07.120]   Yep. And ready to go. I was very excited when the, you know, because it included the RAM
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:14.320]   expansion all the way to four megabytes. It shipped with 512K RAM, which is really more than
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.280]   anybody ever thought you'd need. But, you know, even back then I was kind of a memory hog. So I
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.920]   went up with the four megabyte module. And of course, this was also where we got involved with
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.760]   the SCSI printing bus. Right. The first laser writer. Yeah. That was a. So we got the laser
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.840]   writer. And I got to tell you, when I had that laser writer and was producing those, you know,
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.240]   those little page maker style publications that looked like, you know, hold up tickets,
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.640]   I was just, I was the deal. I had a good friend, Tom Santos, who had a Mac Plus and a little
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.480]   original laser writer and a van. And he drove around and did, you know, kind of portable desktop
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.720]   publishing. You've come to your house and you're working on your nose ladder.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.360]   I got Claire's works here. So, you know, just just one of my first computer-related companies was
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.200]   a company called Whiplash software. And we produced the very first clip art that ever worked with
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:16.160]   these systems. And it was line drawings. Yeah. Yeah. Andy and Naco, come on, you can go,
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.480]   you could do better than a Mac Plus. What was your first Mac?
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:28.480]   Well, now I actually have to say that my first Mac was a Mac 512KE, which I bought when the
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.320]   SE 30 was brand new because it was all I could afford. I used to work at a legendary chain of
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.720]   like department stores in New England called Leechmere in the computer department, of course.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.040]   And they had this really wonderful policy of automatic markdowns because they just,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.920]   one of the successful reasons why they stayed in business before they tanked 10 years ago
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.320]   was that they don't like having merchandise just hanging around. So, automatically, when something
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.200]   gets discontinued, they'll take 10% off and then like a month later, 20% off, then 30% off.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.920]   And then you could tell, like, if you look in the computers, you could tell when they were
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.480]   starting to get desperate to get rid of it because the last two digits of the price would drop from
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   like 97 suddenly to 77. And then when it got down to 44 cents, you knew that it was time to pounce,
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.760]   because if you ask the manager, what if I just give you $100 for this $300 computer, will you take
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.720]   it? They'll just take it because at 44 cents, they are being you told just get rid of it.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.520]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.080]   So, of course, the store policy said that it did have to be out on display.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:31.120]   And so I happily put it on display after disconnecting the flyback transformer so it would not power
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.400]   up. And well, what do you know, 60 days later, it was still out for sale. And so I put in a $100
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:43.200]   offer to call my brand new beat up 512k. And I love the hell out of it. I mean, I had been,
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:50.000]   I mean, I was a PC user. I mean, I was a Mac lover, but a PC user by by by economics up to that point.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.400]   But I mean, one of the reasons why I became active in the Boston computer society early on
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.480]   was because it took me, you know, it took me buses to get down to the BCS Mac offices in
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.320]   Somerville. But then I could spend six or eight hours working on projects on Mac and Tasha's.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:09.200]   When I got home, I would have to edit my files, you know, on my little Corona PC compatible thing
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.480]   that I got on Claire and somewhere for 300 bucks. But the first day I was able to actually do a
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.640]   complete, you know, go go right from dinner up to my bedroom and be working on the computer until,
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.480]   until, you know, until three in the morning without, you know, store managers or office
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.600]   managers saying, look, we have to turn off the lights now. We really needed to leave now.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.520]   Was was quite a majestic day.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.120]   A good day for all good day. A good day.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:42.400]   My first Mac was the first Mac, the original 128 K Mac. I remember looking at the Lisa,
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   you know, with, you know, just ruling at the Lisa, but it was $10,000. And I was just a disc jockey
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.360]   in San Jose at the time. And I really couldn't afford it. And then, of course, January 22nd,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:30:00.880]   the Super Bowl ad. Why 1984 won't be like 1984 and the January 24th, it comes out. Now,
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:08.400]   I really want it because it's only $2,500. One floppy. How big was that first floppy? Was it?
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.760]   It wasn't very big. I remember you.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.520]   400 K. So you had Mac right on it or Mac paint. And if you want data, well, then you have to take the
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.760]   app disk out because there was no hard drive and put the data disk in. I remember lots of disc
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.240]   swapping in those early days. Well, it's one megabyte of memory, a megabyte of video,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:32.160]   buffer. And yeah, I think it was a megabyte screen. It was a 3M machine. It was, sorry,
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:37.760]   memory. No, it's 128 K memory. No, no, no, I know. Right. You're right. I'm sorry. 128 K memory,
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:45.680]   megabyte of video RAM. And I think it was a megabyte of megahertz process or something like that.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:52.960]   Anyway, it was a very fast 68,000. And I finally got it February 2000. I'm sorry,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:59.840]   February 1984. I took my Macy's charge card out and yeah, and went to Macy's. And I think I paid
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:05.920]   that thing off till until the 21st century actually it was still in that $9,000 after the time I
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.480]   paid for it. It probably was. But ran. Never worked. And you couldn't do anything with that thing.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.640]   But man, I was happy to have it. And I've had a Mac ever since. Me too. Yep.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.880]   25 years of history. That's always been the indication of how well Apple got that first version
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.720]   in terms of communicating how important the Macintosh would be. The things that we put up
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.280]   with to get that thing to work. I mean, I still remember I'm at page nine. Damn it. I'm going to
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:33.440]   open a new document because this word processor doesn't let you do more than nine and a half pages.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.560]   It was primitive. But you know, if you watch that video of Steve introducing it in 1984 and
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.920]   the Apple audience cheering to stuff that today we would just take, you know, like big deal. My
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.160]   phone could do a bit more than that. But in those days that was a big deal. I remember when I was
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   I was in high school and my cousin had a had the Mac, the first Mac that came. He bought his dad
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.280]   bought it within a couple of months after it was released. And I was taking a horse. We raised
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.000]   quarter horses. And so I was taking a college course with my uncle on, you know, horse production,
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.240]   you know, and and we had a paper to write at the end of the at the end. And he wrote his on a,
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.840]   you know, on a little word processing typewriter, you know, one of those ones that he and it came
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.800]   out all, you know, it was all and his was much more and he runs a farm. So it was very detailed.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.640]   And mine had I just went on Mac pain. I had a nice horse and I had I had little like outlines
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.520]   and I had all this I had all and it was but it was that early, you know, it was 80 45. And I and
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:32.000]   and I got an A and my uncle got a B. He was not and you saw the writing on the wall. He was not
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.960]   amused. It's all from then on every single time we had any project. I was over at my cousin's house
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:43.440]   working on his Mac because I was like, I know I'm getting a out of this no matter what. So,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.040]   well, happy birthday. Mackintosh has been an amazing 25 years. Just think with the in 25 years
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.440]   will be dead, but you'll still be alive, Justin. Well, I just remember when I was younger that
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.280]   I only had 30 day trials of all of my softwarks. My parents wouldn't buy it from me. They're like,
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:01.600]   I'm buying what do you need that for? And so every 30 days I would reformat my computer and
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:09.600]   that everything up floppy disks. Let me tell you, I didn't know the whole thing on floppies. But
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.960]   that's the course we had a tough at my house. We had a type in all of our code with basic.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:23.120]   Happy birthday, Mackintosh. Thank you all for being here. We really appreciate it. Let's end with
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:31.440]   that famous commercial 1984. 25 years ago. Why 1984 won't be like 1984.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:37.920]   First glorious anniversary of the information for identification of victims. You have created
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.680]   for the first time in all history a garden of pure ideology where each work will be blue.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:54.880]   Secure from the paces of a complicated force. Our own evolution of the most is more powerful than
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:03.360]   any fleet. What on the on earth? We are one. We want to win. One result. One cause.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:10.880]   Our enemies shall talk themselves to death and be quiet. We have no good fortune.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.480]   We shall prevail.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:26.480]   On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Mackintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.240]   1984. Another Mack break is broke.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:42.560]   And for those of you in the Bay Area, I just wanted to mention that the Berkeley Macintosh users
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.200]   group is having a reunion on Thursday. They haven't met years. It was one of the great
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.800]   one of the great big Mack users groups. It was so great every Thursday in Berkeley. They go
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.400]   over there and they give a hard time to every Brazilian. The people come from Adobe and the
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.080]   other companies and they boo them and they yell at them and they ask them tough questions. It was
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.840]   a feisty user group. One of the best. I missed those Thursday nights, but we're going to have
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.440]   another Thursday night at the Hillside Club this Thursday 6 to 9 p.m. Go to my blog and you can find
