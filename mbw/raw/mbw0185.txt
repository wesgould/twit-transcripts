[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We're getting ready for NAB.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So that's in middle of April.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm going to send -- I'm sure going to send Colleen down to that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We should do some wild stuff from there.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Yeah, I won't be going, but many of our staff will.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   That's a big event for us.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Absolutely.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Also here, Mr. Merlin Mann of 43folders.com.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Hello, boys.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Great to see you, my friend.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Thanks.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Nice to be here.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And he did not go to South by Southwest this week.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I didn't.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   This is the artist at work.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, that's all right.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We'll talk about South by in a second.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Andy Inaco is also here from the Chicago Sun Times and his website, the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth at www.cwob.com.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Hello.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Great to have you here.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   We are all today celebrating in one way or another, the birth of Jerry Lewis 84 years ago.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   1926, Mr. Lewis was born.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'll have you know that here in this studio, all the camera operators, the sound guys, the
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   floor chiefs and the directors, they're all in tuxedos.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And people are going to ask me, why are they in tuxedos if they're not on camera?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Because there's something about a man in a tuxedo.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   The tuxedo elevates his game.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He takes his work more seriously.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And that will come through in the final broadcast.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So you are 1980s, Jerry.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I am early late post-percusset.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We had to actually have draw lots to see which Jerry we could be.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I'd like to be the kid if you don't mind.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He was kind of a wild.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Well, we'll talk about Jerry in our audible ad because he was quite the character.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Quite the character.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Some great stories about Jerry and us.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Let us get to the first story of the Mac world today.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It would be Friday's opening day for iPad orders.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And while we don't know exactly how many iPads were sold because Apple isn't saying there are
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   a couple of bloggers, one blogger who counted serial numbers and said 152,000 in the first
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   weekend.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's not bad.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   There's an analyst who said it's much higher than that.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And Apple is reportedly producing or claimed their claims that they're producing like five
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   or six million in the first year.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   They're expecting very high sales.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I think the rumor right now is that it's about 30,000 a day that are getting pre-ordered.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Let's make sure we accurately convey how this is being reported.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Sales have now declined to 30,000 a day of a device that no one has seen.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's amazing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Our cheese fravel.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's pretty amazing how to have a business where you generate $70 million without shipping
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   anything.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   There's so many levels to this that are fine.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I agree with you, Andy.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I saw that I guess was grew with it, the link to that.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Something that's not available yet, that another version of is going to be available in a few
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   weeks that you don't really have to pre-order in order to buy one of the hundreds of thousands.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I mean, I, you know, I, you know, I, who ordered one?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Who ordered it?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   My wife doesn't listen to this.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I pre-ordered.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   But, um, but it is funny to me because it's, you know, if you read the macalope or you follow any of this stuff, people are just looking for any upper and let me just stipulate.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'm always the guy who doesn't want to like over, I don't want to oversell this thing until I've seen it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But on the other hand, the reporting is very funny, especially in the context of looking at any other computer companies, there are any other electronic company that has this kind of response to something ahead of time.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And they're just looking for all these kind of make believe reasons to think that it's not going to be a success and it's ludicrous.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Did you see the market cap of Apple is now number three?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   They're closing in on what they're, well, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're beat Google.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   They're going back and forth, but no, I think they're past Google.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   They're, they're going back and forth between Walmart, Jim and they, they, they've just Walmart for a couple minutes today and they, um, the only, they would be third behind Microsoft and Exxon, who are about another.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I mean, but that's just stock price.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's market cap.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's just market cap.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And the stock price has been, it went down like 1% on Monday because what, because the sales, because the sales had had stock markets, they weren't buying a hundred thousand a day.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And that's why I don't listen to the stock market. It's just not there. It's not why I don't invest in the stock. Yeah, it's not a credible source of information.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Andy, you did an article in the Chicago Sun Times, a good article about seven things we now know about the Apple iPad that we weren't sure about before you want to run through those.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Uh, yeah, there was, it was, it was a big day on Friday, chiefly because I was going through so, I was going through so many, so many emails from so many people.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But quickly realize that Apple had not just opened up the store for the iPad, but they also went ahead and greatly updated all of the pages describing the product.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So there are a lot of things that are now in the, in the product specs that weren't there before among them.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The idea of support of Bluetooth, because Apple sort of very pointedly pointed out that, and because this is works with Bluetooth, this will work with Apple's wireless keyboard.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Which seemed like funny that they weren't saying it will work with any Bluetooth keyboard, but now the text is updated to say, the iPad will work with any Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So theoretically any keyboard you're out of, you have in your closet right now will work just fine.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   The biggest one of them all for me personally was the little line that says that iBooks will run, well, the, the iBook application will work with any ePub formatted book.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So I presume if it's not, none, a DRM content, but that should mean that if you download something.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The line, the exact line is the books app uses the ePub format.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   As the most popular open book format in the world, that makes it easier for publishers to create iBooks versions of their favorite reads.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And you can add free ePub titles to iTunes and sync them to the iBooks app on your iPad.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So that's what everybody's been asking me is if I get an iBook, you know, if I can I download arbitrary books and put them on my iPad.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So the answer is yes.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Right. It looks like you'll be responsible for downloading them yourself.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It looked from the, there's still a lot of blanks left to be filled in here, but the, but the wordage makes me think that it'd be more like an iTunes syncing sort of thing where you can sort of introduce it into iTunes.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Then tell iTunes, please sync these books.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   It would be great if there was a file association with the ePub format so that if I tap on I'll download link in Project Gutenberg and Safari, it automatically hands off that dot extension.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It makes it available in iBooks.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   But don't make that yourself. Can't you mean you just do that yourself?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Change that in the, with that default, default app application.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But it's, but what's really invigorating about that is I think all of us have been wondering all along whether this will have some kind of parody with what's made the iTunes store successful, which even before the, you know, Alex and I talk about this every week, but before the apps even came along.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I think one thing, if the iTunes store went out of the box saying all you could have is DRM, you know, AACs.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It would have been horrible.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It would have been horrible. Much slower adoption. But now I mean, I need iCalibre to have my book sync up.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I like iCalibre OK for what it is, but I really would much rather have something.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And if they can pull that off with the companies they're negotiating with, think about what that does for Apple in the long run.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Again, they become the hub.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You're not relying on some kind of cobbled little, with all respect, some cobbled together Python app to do your syncing.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   What do you guys use to convert things to ePub? Because I'm going to have PDFs and I have other things that aren't in PDA.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Maybe PDFs will sync probably.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I just use stanza.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Stanza will convert from any format to any format.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   A couple of features that people don't really use that they should is the ability to convert even desktop Word documents, an office documents to ePub formats.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Also, you can just simply give it a URL to any webpage and it'll turn that webpage into an e-book.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   That was another thing we learned, which is that the $10 version of pages that will be on the iPad will not only read, but also write Word files.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Which the current one does.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   For business that thing I was making.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   That was a new thing.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   See, the other cool thing is that's another piece of boilerplate that was appearing in just about every single iWork app.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   You can easily share the documents you create in pages in a few ways.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Attach them to an email as pages files for the Mac, web software files, PDF documents, or upload them to the iWork.com public beta.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   There's a text in every one of these apps that simply says that anything you create, any document you create in these apps can be shared with not just with other iWork apps, but also with just about any other app that's visible to the rest of the OS.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   We've been saying a lot of business folks who don't do a lot of heavy computing, just wanting to have an iPad that they can read and modify a Word document.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yeah, for sales people, I think that's going to be a lot of people are buying and very painfully Windows mobile devices, Windows mobile phones so that they can read and write their Word documents or their office documents.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   This would be a great way to make a great presentation tool.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So I think that having meaning well and that's a question.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Maybe you know this Andy because I bought what we ordered four iPads.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   You can only get it two at a time.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So I ordered one and then I had Lisa order another.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I ordered two and Lisa ordered another two.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And the 499 one because I'm happy with 16 gigs. I don't think I need more than that. I'm not going to put music and much music on it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   But now I got sidetracked.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   We were talking about the presentation presentations.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Presentations. I ordered the VGA dongle.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   They have a $20.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And we've never seen this before.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Connector, iPod connector to VGA output.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So Andy, do you know or does anybody know what's that going to output?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Do you know what's going to be movies that I play back on this?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Is this just for looking at the TV?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But we don't know for, we don't know yet.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They've made mention of both movies and key, excuse me.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I am contradicting myself.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   They've definitely made mention of keynote being able to be used as a presentation device.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's huge.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   They haven't specifically mentioned using it as a video out for your video content.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I don't know how they would work it so that they would produce a dongle that only works for video with one application.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So I'm working with the theory that it will just be a general display out device.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So, but again.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I wish they would do it.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   They would finally let us actually see the interface via video output.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   It would be cool if you could see the whole iPad on VGA.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I mean, the first thing I'm going to do, we're going to get, it's going to arrive April 3rd.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   It's a Saturday.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'll be doing the radio show.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I hope that that VGA adapter comes because the first thing I'm going to do is plug it in.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I've got a VGA out right here.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And I'm going to see if I can broadcast the video if I can get the whole iPad.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   That'd be fantastic.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   You would have to wonder why they wouldn't do that, especially considering that they've already opened it up to mechanical keyboards and stuff like that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So not that they're going to invite people to please connect this to a VGA display and use it as a desktop computer, but that would be sort of a very overt thing for them to say.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   If they have the choice between saying this will just be a generalized video out device no matter what you want, output from it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Even if you just want to demonstrate your iPad to people, we will let you do that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That would be one thing.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   If they're going to say, we're going to be very, very selective about how you can output video.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   That would be a pretty bold gesture.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I don't get the thought process around the iPhone when they don't allow it to be outputted because I mean, that's why they know how to do it.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They do it every single time you watch the every time when they're up on stage, they're doing it.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   They have a version that they have a connector that lets you do that.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And it looks like by the way, Steve, when he was showing it off, did not have any of that big fancy thing.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   They had a back on the thing.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It looked like he was just playing it off the dock.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I couldn't really tell, but looking, I was looking carefully to see what they were using.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Maybe this is it.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Maybe that would be huge.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Then suddenly all the iPhone apps, we could show all this stuff.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   That's half the reason we haven't gotten our iPhones because we're just not happy with the when we shoot video of it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   You're shooting a video over someone's hand.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I mean, it's just annoying.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   If my long-standing theory ends up even being partially true, they're trying to become the hub for all your digital stuff.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I think about the use case.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I used to do this with my iPod all the time.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I would bring that little cable with the red, white, and yellow output from the double jack.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And it could watch it in a hotel room.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And I think that's definitely a use case.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And if you're going to try and take a business market seriously, I mean, obviously you're going to have to give them to the dongles with the stuff if you're going to deal.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But I think that that's a tremendous use case is either a hotel room or a sales presentation.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Because I agree with all you guys as a sales, like as a presentation device.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   This is unbeatable.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And if I have to go to a talk somewhere, gosh, if I could just bring this thing along and plug it in, that would basically put it on the podium.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Ryan McIner chat room is saying that according to the, I'm sorry, in road 27 saying according to the SDK,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I think the SDK may have capabilities that are actually not part of the iPad.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   But according to the SDK, there is the capability of mirroring or second display out just like a real computer.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   So that, but I mean, it makes sense that would be the most useful choice.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Great.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Go ahead, Annie.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   No, no, all I was going to say is that I think apples, I think we're going to see much more of a press for business use of the iPad than we might have guessed a few months ago.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I'm sure that of the suite of commercials that are going to come out in May or June, you know, there's going to be the one that is the old.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Hey, I'm into gaming.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   So I have an iPad.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   They'll be the, hey, I'm into videos.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So I'm in, I'm into iPad.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   There's going to be a business one because I talked last week about that user survey that went out where you drill through lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of questions until you get to like the, the, the, the, the, the new giddy center of the stuff they actually want to know about, which is, okay, let's assume that you're
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   using this for business.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Do you think that you'd use it to do a presentation from?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But how important is word to you, you know, so I really think that they're, they're going to be pressing that button pretty hard.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   This is, this is good news.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Also in your article, you said that there is a file system and apps will be able to access the file system.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So essentially you'll be able to, to get arbitrary access to files, right?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Well, not necessarily arbitrary access, but that does sync up with other stuff that's been written about how individual applications will work with individual files, the idea that each one will have like something, something that's going to be able to access the file system.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So you can put documents exactly so that if you have like an extra, like a workout program, it can, and you said, and you want to tell to please share your workout data with other apps, you can press a button and then suddenly when you go into hypothetically, you can then go into numbers, numbers could look for any, any Excel type file that's on the device.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It would find that file that just got created. Now you have a nice chart of how abjectly you're failing at making, keeping up with your marathoning plans.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   So you don't have to do some kind of weird roundabout way of uploading to a website and downloading from somewhere else. I mean, that's what you kind of look like.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I mean, if I were to eat them right now, I would be spending a lot of time on the iPad version of phone view because I use phone view almost every day.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   What's that?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   People, yeah, people don't know about phone view. You basically, do you guys use it at all, Andy? You use it?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It's made by Ecamm, the folks who do this call recorder app.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Oh, I know phone view. I do have that. Yeah.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Well, it kind of takes all these, you know, pull your songs out of your iPod, apps, and it really kind of blows it all open.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I'll get you a screen grab.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Does it still work? I mean, oh, yeah. It works on my iPhone. I use it all the time to pull off all your text messages.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I do it because I want to stay synced with one computer. I don't want to mess with the foo. You know what I mean?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Like, if you, like, I did a thing for a while. I was syncing my photos with one Mac and everything else with another.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Well, now I just, once a week or so, I just pull up phone view and just drag everything off of my iPhone and then you have access to all the files.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It's like magic. I'll do a screen grab for you. But it works great.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And so, I guess what I'm getting at is, what's the analogy?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I'm thinking of, you know, that app I love so much, Expand Drive, which, you know, you take something that used to seem really arcane, like SSH, and now it's just a malleable drive on your Mac.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Somebody's going to find a market opportunity for doing that with your iPad. You know what I mean? You plug it in and they'll figure out a way to make it malleable.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I think that's going to happen.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But getting back, the, what it looks, what people are saying based on developer docs is that you won't have access to the full file system.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   You won't be able to go to, you know, users/lib/sis/less.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   But each app will have a public folder so that when you mount it on your desktop, it will look like a USB mask storage device.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   You can drag files in and out of these individual folders, not only that, but also that other apps could see into these folders on the device.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   So that's one of the first things I'm really looking forward to beating the hell out of when I get my iPad, seeing how well this works.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I keep saying that it's not so much, you can't get into being a feature slut and making that into it.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Really? The way that you say, well, I'm going to produce a table of three columns and I'm going to put this device in this column and this device in this column.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And the fact that this one doesn't have a phone jack means that this other device must be better because it has a phone jack in the other hand.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   You have to really make sure you stay focused on the idea of what you can do with the device as opposed to what it says in the specs.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I don't really need an open file system on a device like this, so long as I have the ability to easily put my own documents into it and get my own documents out of it.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And also so that for 500 bucks, I should have a suite of applications that all week work together without having to have a Wi-Fi base station connecting two different computers.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   I don't want to change the subject, but I think we've got to move through this list. There's seven items.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   A lot of people asked me on the radio show about accessibility on the iPad and I said, well, I assume it's going to be similar to the iPhone, but I don't know.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It looks like accessibility is very serious.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   That's seriously aggressive. Voiceover works with throughout the entire system. So if you have vision problems, it will speak the interface to you.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I don't know how well work given that there's no such thing as a mouse hover on this.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think we'll have to see how it's going. How are you going to tell it? Please describe the interface to me where I need to tap.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I do that with the tap sometimes. We're all tapping hold to see what the resulting... You know what I mean?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   If you're in Safari, if you tap and hold, it offers you an open copy, etc. That's a hack.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   But I wonder if it could do something similar to that where you tap and hold and it would read you the result after so many seconds.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   But the problem is that if you have extremely low vision, how do you know that there's a button here that I need to tap?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   We're not necessarily talking to people who have no vision, but very low vision.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Even for that, they can give you white on black. They can give you huge zoom scaling. It's very, very big.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Also, interestingly enough, they've also added speakable text to the iBook app.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So any page that you want read aloud, it will read to you aloud. I don't know if that extends to the entire book.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Remember the kerfuffle that the book agents had about speakable books on the Kindle?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But at least you can simply turn the page and say, "Please speak this page." And it will use apparently the same voice system that's in macOS 10.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Could I show you two things? First of all, let me blow your mind with an accessibility thing. Nobody knows.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Right now, if you're in front of your Mac, hit Ctrl + Option + Command + 8.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Ctrl + Option + Command + 8. Wow! Everything turned weird, except it didn't on my screen, unfortunately.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It's great if you're outside. So what that does is that basically does a negative version of every color on your screen.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So if you're outside and you've got glare, it's a function that was in there, I think, for accessibility reasons.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   But if you're in bright light, it's a really great way to be able to see your screen.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That's really cool. It reverses it.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And if you go to Kung Fu Grip on the homepage right now, I just put up what PhoneView looks like.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   I put up PhoneView and I put up Calibre. So you can see, the PhoneView you can see, all I have to do is click in the panel and it brings up all my songs, which I can pull off.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And it's kind of cool because you can pull off all of your text messages.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I mean, that sounds maybe not that useful, but all your videos, all your anything without having to interact with iTunes.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So I'm sure as it still do everything they can to shut these guys down, but it's a tremendously useful app for me, you can't.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Well, that's why I asked, is it still work? Because I was... It works today.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Yeah, I was really... That's it right there.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I thought for sure it would be broken. This is Calibre, which is the program you use to convert EPUB.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Yeah, the reason I put it up is I wanted to show you quickly that this is...
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I mean, nothing against the developers of this, but it's very much kind of like a classic open source Python app.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   In that second pane, you can see where basically you see all the choices I've got for changing that.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   You can set all...
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   You can set all...
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   FB2, Lit, L-R-F, Moby, which is...
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Does Moby and EPUB...
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Kindle, it's kind of formal.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Then it serves it all on a port.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   So basically, you know, an IAS DD1S, so...
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Or DD1... What's called? You know what I mean?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   The dynamic...
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Oh, Dine DNS, yeah.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Dine DNS. So I could be anywhere in the world and I pull up my domain name and a port.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And all my books are there, and I can grab them from Stanza on the iPhone, which I agree is...
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Stanza on the iPhone is just outstanding.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   There's nothing that touches Stanza on the iPhone right now.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And we still don't know if Stanza will be allowed to work on the iPad, but we have no reason to believe not, right?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Last thing with this, though, that's really sexy.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I'm really into things where I can pull down my RSS feeds easily.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I have an automated script that every time I plug in my Kindle, it automatically...
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I stole this from somebody else, but it automatically downloads my entire...
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Instapaper.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   RSS feed as a legitimate HTML file and puts it on my Kindle.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   The automator does that every time I plug in in.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   In this instance, every time I open up Caliber, it automatically, with like a cron kind of thing, goes out and pulls down all the RSS feeds I ask for, and pulls...
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Just drags them right on.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   So you see like there are unknown news sources you might see that line.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   That's pulling in an RSS feed, and every RSS feed I want becomes something I can read it on my iPhone on a plane, if you like.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   It's really cool.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I'd love to see some of these features come around.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   The reason I mention this here is that Amazon...
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I think Amazon's model is increasingly their interests are going to diverge from apples, if that's not obvious already.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And as they try to really throttle what they do with Stanza, which they now own, it's going to be interesting to see how Apple, with the deals they can negotiate, you know, the terms of those deals, what they're able to do to basically make the Kindle increasingly kind of obviated.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And as I scroll down on "Cunk for Grip," I find the next item, which is a discarded snuggie deluxe spot.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   That is not mine, Leo. That is not mine.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Sure.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I don't like being warm that much.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   I have a good... I bought three Google snuggies, so I have nothing to do.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Weezer, you know, weezer, our pal Patrick from Weezer, they sell them now.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   They got an infomercial where you can buy a...
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Weezer snuggies?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I'd buy one of those.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Sure, they're following the money.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   So, I'm going to go to the wrong confirmation.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   This is item five.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Follow the money.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Item five, confirmation that location services work even on Wi-Fi, even from...
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So, that means I could use the maps, Andy, with a Wi-Fi only?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Yeah, and that location services was really a source of fear and certainty and doubt for
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   a lot of people who are already negative against the iPad.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.240]   You know that Apple bought the technology that basically allows you to use location services
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   based on nearby Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   And so they're...
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   It's in the book, right?
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   Was it sky?
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   Exactly, yeah.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.040]   And so on the page describing maps, it says, "IPAD with Wi-Fi finds your location using
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.360]   known Wi-Fi hotspots and another good thing.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.880]   And Wi-Fi plus 3G models use Wi-Fi GPS and cellular towers because there are a lot of
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.640]   people in those infamous tables of things that the iPad doesn't do.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   It was hot.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.480]   It was spotlighting the phrase, "Assisted GPS" to make people think that, "Oh, well,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.480]   it doesn't have a real GPS radio, and it's just going to go by Wi-Fi-based stations."
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   It said, "No, it's just...
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   It will work apparently just the same way that the iPhone does where it will get a rough
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:57.000]   fix based on cellular towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, then use real GPS to get your location within
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   several yards."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Yeah, I think that was a misunderstanding of what AGPS is.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   AGPS is not GPS.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.480]   It is GPS with help from the cell towers.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   So it gets fast.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.640]   It gets fast early locationing.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   And then...
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   But eventually does use GPS.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.080]   Because there are a lot of devices that do use fake GPS that way.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.920]   Does that accelerate the speed of the cold start?
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   Is that the...
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   Yeah, that's the point.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   That's the point.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   Yeah, because if you're...
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   Oftentimes you're in that situation where you get off the plane from San Francisco and
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.920]   you're in Boston and on a conventional GPS like on my own Garmin, I know that I'd have
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.280]   to wait at least five minutes because I just moved my GPS 3000 miles.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.360]   It's looking for satellites that are nowhere near Boston now.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.240]   And so it has to start from ground zero, look for any GPS signal can find, and then make
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.320]   calculations based on that.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   With the...
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   It already...
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.120]   Based on the fact that I turned it on sometime somewhere in Boston and it found a cell tower
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.480]   like three seconds later.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.320]   Now it knows what time zone it's in.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.440]   It knows essentially what constellation it should be looking for.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   So that cuts down the time.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.680]   Not only the amount of time it's going to take, but also cuts down hugely.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.720]   The amount of battery power it's going to have to consume just to get that first fix.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.360]   There's a good Wikipedia article on what assisted GPS is and does and I highly recommend
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.560]   it a GPS.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.520]   Sometimes I can't get my newbie out of first gear.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.160]   Sometimes I've got to basically go into the configurations, do a reboot, and then basically
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.640]   have to remind it that I speak English and want it in miles.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   And I have to do the whole reset to get it...
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   Huh.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.280]   I even get it to the point where it goes, are you hundreds of miles away?
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.840]   Well, the...
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.560]   I used to have to do that with the first generation iPhone.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.040]   I still, you know, with an Nexus one, sometimes it'll think.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.440]   It takes a while to get it locked.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   When you're in a new...
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.120]   Like when I went to Austin, when you're a new area, one of the things GPS does is download
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.600]   an Almanac of satellites.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.200]   It needs that information before it can calculate where you are.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.240]   So the first time you're in a new area, it usually is a long time before you were able
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.960]   to get a signal lock.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   But then thereafter it's fast.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.600]   One of the things that I think that someone should do, I don't know whether they can manipulate
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.480]   the current structure or whether someone has to...
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.880]   But I think some kind of local positioning system that a mall or a museum or a park...
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.040]   I'm sure that'll happen.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.320]   It gets accurate to the foot or half foot.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.760]   You know, and really knows exactly where you're standing in front of this.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   Especially when you're inside.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   Because there's no GPS signal with that.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   Well, you look at those stupid...
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:16.160]   I went to the King Tut thing in San Francisco and you have this weird thing that you put
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   up against your ear and it weighs back.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.040]   You should know exactly where you are so that it can tell you that you just walk around
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.400]   and then we don't have to hand out those stupid things.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   There must be something like that because there are museums where they give you an iPod
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.600]   or an iPod touch rather.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.760]   Well, it's probably easier to triangulate inside of there.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.920]   But you know what's funny, Leo?
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.080]   You know where I noticed this is on Siri.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.360]   Increasingly, I use Siri for so much stuff.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.760]   I've mentioned it as a pick before.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   It's an app.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.040]   You know, if you don't remember, it's a voice recognition app that does stuff.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   And it's funny.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.640]   Sometimes I'll fire it up and you know, it works.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.120]   It really works.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   What it does works.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.040]   I'll say something like sushi near me or ATM near office or whatever.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   How do I get home?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.800]   You can actually say that and it'll give you direction.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   There's a real sickness.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.240]   I noticed it south by southwest.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.720]   Kind of the four square go walla sickness where you can't the minute you get anywhere, even
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.080]   if like you're going from exhibit to exhibit in a museum, you've got to check in.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   That's the guy in that man.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   That stuff is weird.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.560]   So I'm starting to think that that's kind of somebody said and I think it's true.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.920]   Four squares kind of the farmville.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   I'm waiting for the privacy.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.320]   9/11 with that stuff, man.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.680]   It just freaks me out some of that.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.480]   Well, I don't mind people knowing where I am.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.240]   But I mean, I've said this before.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.080]   My wife and I used to be on Brightkite and we like so many things.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.280]   We used it wrong.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.840]   We used it as a two person Twitter.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.720]   And it was fantastic for that.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.640]   Except for the times we would accidentally flip a bit and make it public.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.480]   Everybody knows where you are and all the sex figures.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.040]   It's like what bums me out is and I don't want to be tarred with this idea that I'm
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   against these services.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.160]   I want, this is something Dana Boyd has talked about really, really like everything she
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   does very intelligently.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.720]   She did give a great keynote.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   She's so good.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   She's so good.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   She's so good.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   Smart.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.200]   And she says the way she talks about teenagers is kind of how I feel too, which is it's not
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.320]   that I don't care about my privacy.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.600]   It's that I care about the granularity of my privacy.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.680]   Like there's certain kinds of people.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.320]   It's almost how I feel about my iPhone.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.080]   We're like, I want a super, super, super strong lock on the front door and then I don't need
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.580]   any locks inside the house.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.160]   Right now I have a really flimsy lock on the front door and hundreds of locks throughout
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.320]   the house.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.200]   With me, I want to be able to say I don't want anybody but these two or five people
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.800]   to ever see anything I do on this service.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.680]   But there's no economy of scale to that for the business.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   They don't want to make that it's candidly.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.200]   They don't want to make it easy.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.360]   So I think it's important to separate the functionality of location based services from
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.560]   the businesses that are leveraging it for these economies of scale.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.520]   I've had a really hard time finding a replacement for that to be honest because it is super
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   useful.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   Over.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   Over.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   I'm realizing I've been in a lot of interviews this week.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   I realize I speak in announcements.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   I'm going to stop.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   It's okay.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.960]   Over is a good way to signal that you're done.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   Over.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.440]   Speaking of which Peter Graves died.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   That's for later.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Hey, passed away.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   White-haired guy in Mission Impossible.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   More than that.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   He like laddier movies.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   Ever seen a grown man naked.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   It's still funny.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   I'm afraid.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   I'm afraid.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   Yes.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.440]   All right.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Airplane you're talking about.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   Sorry.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   And please don't call me Shirley.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.960]   Confirmation that the iPad I'm so happy to hear this.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.600]   So so happy to hear this.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   We'll support a two DP stereo Bluetooth.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   Yep.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.840]   Or if you prefer some private listening.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.040]   Connect wired or Bluetooth wireless headphones.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   And it's just you your favorite tunes and fantastic sound.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640]   What good news?
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   I mean, that's that's a big deal.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.400]   I was never I was never a big fan of wireless headphones because of for like devices like
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.960]   that because I'm like, you know what?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.160]   I mean, I'm the laziest guy in the world, but even I can deal with, you know, a cable
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.560]   like this, you know, that's that's not a big deal for me to have three feet of cable like
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.720]   that in my pockets.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.320]   But the idea that I can just set my iPad going anywhere inside the car and know that it'll
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.560]   it'll find the audio system and connect to it.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   That's a really cool thing.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.800]   It's also one of those blue sky sort of things where I can't wait to see how people are going
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.760]   to really exploit that.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.680]   It's also a thing when you think about when you think about that this has it does have
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   a VGA connector.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   Okay.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   That's good.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.520]   But how are you going to get audio from the device to the machine if you have the idea
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.960]   that you can have this pad someplace in your living room and you have this little box that
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.400]   cost a hundred bucks plugged into your home stereo.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.600]   And essentially you're using this as a mobile iTunes library to control every single aspect
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.240]   of the audio in your house or in that room just via Bluetooth without any extra dongles
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.680]   that extra any extra cables on the device.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   That's cool.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   That's big mojo.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.680]   Hey, what do you think?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.840]   How many of you are going to wait for the 3G iPad?
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   I thought maybe I just use it with a MIFI.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.960]   Now the only thing I'm losing there is the GPS, right?
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.120]   You're losing the GPS.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.320]   You're also losing unlimited data.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.280]   Unfortunately, you're also losing a minute.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.920]   Is it the same kind of unlimited data?
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.080]   My Fi is 5 gigabyte.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   5 gigs.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   5 gigabyte cap.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.280]   And you think the iPad is truly unlimited or is it the same unlimited that they've always
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.680]   been talking about?
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.520]   They've been saying now that's a good question because when I was talking to Paul when I
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.320]   was reviewing the pre, it said unlimited data.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.160]   Then I read the terms and conditions and it mentioned a 5 gigabyte cap.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.320]   Everybody says unlimited with 5 gigabytes.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.480]   They said we define unlimited as 5 gigabytes.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   Okay.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.920]   That's not how Webster's defines unlimited.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   But AT&T has said that frequently enough and we've seen people blow past it without additional
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.800]   charges that, yeah, we've been unlimited unlimited for what is it?
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   30 bucks a month?
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   It's pretty good.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   Not, yeah.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.320]   That's the other big deal that remember that when you buy the MIFI, no matter who you
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.600]   buy it from, you're going to have to buy a contract.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.880]   And those contracts cost a lot more than 30 bucks a month.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.560]   So you're locked in for a year, maybe two years.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.440]   With the AT&T plan, it costs you 30 bucks.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.520]   You're done and done in one.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   If you don't want it the next month, you just say, please don't recur this payment and
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.320]   we'll simply stop charging for it.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.800]   And you just got to decide whether because you're not going to be able to tether with
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   it.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.720]   So like when I, with my MIFI, I definitely imagine using it with my iPad.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.920]   I also use it with my iPhone and I use it with my laptop.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.800]   And actually when we're somewhere, a lot of us use it with the laptop at the same time
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.960]   we're on the road.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   Right.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.360]   It's 60 bucks a month for coverage five MIFI.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.400]   But the way I see it is that it's the last 60 bucks a month I ever have to spend to get
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.600]   any of my mobile devices connected to the internet wherever I go.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.880]   So I had to buy a 3G model because I'm running books about this and running articles about
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   this.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.560]   I need to have access to every single feature in service.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.640]   But honestly, if I were to just simply spend my own money and I don't have this sort of
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.440]   job or I need to cover that sort of stuff, so in such detail, I probably would have gone
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.440]   with the Wi-Fi model.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.200]   Maximize the amount of storage because that's the benefit I'm definitely going to be able
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.360]   to exploit.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.920]   But I think that's going to be one of the winning combinations.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   Well, we've said that.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.540]   A couple of sites have also turned up web pages from Verizon saying that to their sales
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.760]   teams, their marketing team saying that look, iPad is coming out.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.800]   This is a great opportunity for us to sell more MIFIs because if we sell the advantages
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.600]   of being on the Verizon network instead of AT&T, the advantages of saying not only buying
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.880]   coverage for your device, but also for your laptop and three other phones besides, we
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.800]   think we can push a lot of devices that way.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.880]   So that's an interesting bit of commerce.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.440]   Now what someone needs to do is build a case for your iPad that has a little thing that
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.920]   pops into the back that you can pop your MIFI into and then you just be able to have
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   like a nice little case of MIFI.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   Yeah, well, I will use the MIFI.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.080]   I would be able to identify that case by the way.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:32.200]   Well, speaking of cases, delays on the iPad keyboard dock, the iPad power adapter, the
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.560]   USB power adapter now till sometime in the month of May, according to Apple, and the
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   $39 iPad soft case, which was supposed to ship day of, has been delayed in mid April,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.040]   the $69 keyboard dock and the power adapter late April.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.000]   How do you power it by you have to connect the computer?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   You have to connect the computer.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.720]   Well, no, no, it comes with the power adapter.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.600]   Oh, so that's just on the extra ones.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.760]   This is an extra one.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   Okay.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   I was like, well, I was going to get a real short trip.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.920]   I want that kiss because that's the no, it's the one.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.080]   Everyone's making a case though.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   Why do you need that case?
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.480]   Yeah, I got my first iPad case in the mail today.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.960]   What the hell is that?
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.480]   What's inside of a cow?
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.520]   Quick, get a screen grab quick.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   No, no, no, for God's sake.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.920]   If Apple gave me an iPad three weeks early, do you think I'd be like, holy cats?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.320]   I just looked at it.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   Oh, no.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   It'd almost be worth it.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.840]   Unless, of course, I developed a special foam core flip case for it so I could use it openly.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.920]   And now the cat is become the most.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.800]   Not that you have ever tried to fool us in the past.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.880]   That looked like a pretty cool case.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   It did.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.680]   It's a scuba case.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.560]   The guys from Temba are selling them, Temba.com solid.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.000]   Unfortunately, I think there was either miscommunication or something.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.200]   They were sending me one of their new courier bags just on something I'm related.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.480]   They told me, we have a new line of iPad accessories.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.440]   And so they had them send me the scuba because at some point I'm going to have an iPad, I
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   hope.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.520]   The Apple's going to let me buy one at least.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.320]   So this is a snareprene.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.120]   It's a very, very simple pouch.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:15.400]   It has two D-rings on the back so that if you want to connect up this trendy shoulder strap,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.520]   you can wear it like a courier purse or something like that and also has this little zippered
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.400]   bag over here for accessories.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.800]   So it's, I think they're going to be, I think there's what you're looking for, two different
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.480]   styles of bags, bags that are going to be like this, which are just, I don't care about
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.320]   it being a Voltron and transforming into a desktop and a key station.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.400]   I just want something that I can, I just want a simple cheap little sleeve that'll protect
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.960]   it from mumps and scratches.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.160]   And then you want the kind of transforms into an easel so I can use it either in this way
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.560]   or typing this way.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.160]   By the way, the battery life on that cardboard iPad is excellent according to Gary.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   It beats the Kindle.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.520]   Now, unfortunately, like in Greg's sunlight, you get sort of a glare problem, but you
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   know what?
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   And I've heard this.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.120]   I just point something out.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:09.080]   If I may, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but the sales of cardboard iPads are down.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.480]   They only made, they only sold 30,000, you know, with fake monopoly money.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.320]   So I mean, I think that's already plateaued.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.720]   I mean, we're not going to see anything.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   You're jealous.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   You're a hater.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   You're jealous because I have a cardboard iPad and you don't.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   The B and Robin are the early adopters.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.160]   I'm sure I'll have to buy the new aluminum one that comes out and stick on.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.240]   Oh gosh, I didn't know it came with for sure.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.120]   Apple stock price now going up, by the way, a little bit.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.680]   So I think it's currently at $224.21.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.360]   So their market cap is going up a little bit.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   And I think maybe a little rebounding from the naysayers of yesterday who dropped it
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   by.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   Well, and there's so many people that are just waiting to see whether it really turns
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   out.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.600]   I mean, I think there's the crazy people like us who have all pre-ordered and we're just
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.760]   waiting for them to show up.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.920]   But then there's the normal people who will buy them the day, you know, the week after,
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   if there's any available.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.840]   I mean, one of the reports is that they're the Apple, folks at the Apple store are saying,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   you know, they're not sure how many more orders they're going to take before they can't.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.120]   They just don't know if they can.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   If you do an in-store order.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.680]   Well, you know, can I just mention one of them just freed up because I just canceled
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.680]   my reservation.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   Did you?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   Oh, you know what?
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.760]   I wanted, I don't want it intensely, but I guess I did get it.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.960]   Oh, I kind of think I want to wait.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   Am I zooming out?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.280]   If I was briefly, go ahead.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.640]   No, I, but you know what?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   I, I, two things.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.920]   First of all, you know, I was going to just go with the Wi-Fi.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.880]   But now that you're hearing what Andy's talking about, I probably should wait.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   And you know what?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   I want to see if these things are real.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   Actually, that cool.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   That's a lot of money.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   You know what?
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   I want to wait.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   That's, that's such an important point.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.160]   That's something that I've been trying to make that, you know, again, those of us who
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.280]   are involved in this podcast have a real reason for wanting to get one early, make sure
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.560]   that we preorder one and make sure this we can get one on April 3rd.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:02.020]   People who are developing iPad hardware and software also have a very, very good reason
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.680]   for wanting to do that.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   But what I'm going to do is I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   I think there's a huge opportunity for magazines to make sure that they're providing content
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   on the iPad that doesn't exist anywhere else because that's going to help really drive sales
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.680]   of even their current subscribers who want to have the iPod version because they want
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   to get whatever this extra is.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.680]   I think that's going to be a huge push.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   If they're smart, they're going to do that because that's going to give people a reason
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.680]   to buy rather than just have another free access to their content.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.680]   I did.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.400]   This week's column for the Sun Times is going to be a big piece about digital comics, not
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.200]   just on the iPad, but just in general.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:36.000]   I got interviews with the editors in chief of DC, the new publisher, editor in chief
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.280]   of Marvel Comics, the new publisher of DC Comics.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.360]   I interviewed them separately and they're both saying the exact same thing, that they
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:49.120]   both have a lot of goals and a lot of, they see a lot of potential in tablet apps like
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.800]   the iPad and other things like that.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.920]   But their goal will never be to replace traditional paper publishing.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:01.720]   Their goal will be to just like, they're very, very pleased to have Batman movies in addition
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.080]   to the Batman comic and the Batman Lego game and the Batman toys because it's part of the
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.640]   greater universe of their characters that when they approach digital comics that way
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:15.040]   and digital publishing that way, it will be a way to help to bring people into the comic
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.640]   bookstores to buy the comics as well.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.040]   So that's exactly what you're saying there Alex is exactly in line with not only with
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.440]   what these comic publishers are talking about, but also what a lot of other publishers have
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.440]   been talking to me about.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.080]   You do have to wonder why Apple did it, but somebody in our chat room has pointed out
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.240]   and they're absolutely right that if you were to bookmark the National Geographic site,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.880]   you know where you take a site and you put it on the homepage, you would get exactly
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   that icon.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.240]   That is the favicon for the National Geographic.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.280]   So, okay, can we do this here?
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.360]   I mean, well, I don't know.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.040]   I mean, Apple put it there for a reason, obviously.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.480]   I mean, they know that people look at this stuff like it's the Holy Grail.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.120]   So I don't know.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   Is Apple trying to prank you?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.520]   I don't think they're trying to prank me, but it just, like he goes back to the idea
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.040]   of why would they include a bookmark or something?
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.920]   I mean, that is an excellent point.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.320]   What's the URL, Nat Geo?
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.720]   Nationalgeographic.com and that is the favicon.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   It's exactly that.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.560]   And if you take that on your iPhone, I think if you take that on the iPhone, somebody should
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   do that on your iPhone.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   I'm doing it right now.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   It's the exact icon.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.640]   And save it as Nat Geo?
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   And save it as Nat Geo.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   Well, that's okay.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.440]   You can do that yourself.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.440]   No.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.080]   A little detective work going on right now.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   We're going to take a break while you guys are doing that detective work.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.600]   It's like a bird that Hardy boys or something, we're having an adventure.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   Well, they do the detective work.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   We are going to talk a little bit about our good friends at Gazelle.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.520]   What a great idea for a website.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.440]   We've all got old gear that we want to get rid of sitting around in the closet, sitting
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:58.360]   around in the drawer, maybe old cell phones, MP3 players, laptops, gaming consoles.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:06.760]   Well here's a way to get rid of it and get some money to Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.680]   If you go to Gazelle.com right now, you can enter in the device you've got.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.160]   Tell it what condition it's in.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.200]   Now, important, a number of people said, "Hey, I didn't get as much money as I thought because
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.400]   you've got to be accurate.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   You can't.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.320]   You got to say what the quality of it is."
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.680]   So let's say I have an old iPhone.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.120]   Now, and by the way, as soon as you get on your iPhone, it starts giving you the choices.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.840]   Two G8 gigs, two G4 gigs.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.240]   Make sure you do this accurately.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.800]   Let's say we have a 3G, 16 gig iPhone.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.000]   You could search for it.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.240]   Now here's what happens.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.200]   It'll tell you, depending on the condition, what they'll pay for it.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:49.320]   And I'm going to say I've got the 3GS that I'm going to get rid of.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.400]   And is, because it makes your call successfully, yes, free of water damage, yes, rate the overall
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   condition.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   Well, it's not perfect.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.880]   It's got some, you know, it's not exactly brand new.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:03.400]   Do you have the original cables, the AC adapter, yes, calculate the value and they'll pay you
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   $352 for it.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.080]   Now here's the beauty part.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   You say add the box.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:15.720]   They'll send you a box, pre-ship, prepaid shipping box that you can then load your gadgets into.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.520]   And once you've loaded them in, you send them back.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.080]   Gazelle evaluates them and pays you, sends you the check.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.840]   If you decide not to accept their offer, they'll ship it back to you.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.880]   And by the way, you can select the payment method you want PayPal, check, or if you do
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.640]   an Amazon gift card, a 5% bonus to the value.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.440]   Or if you want to be a nice guy, you can donate to charity.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:45.600]   In fact, one of the things I like about Gazelle, if you are a charity, let's say you want to
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:51.080]   raise some money for the team or you're a school or an organization, you can also set
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.360]   up a Gazelle page and then tell your team members, hey, donate your old electronics to
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.880]   Gazelle and the money goes to us.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.360]   I think this is a great idea.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   We also have, if they say, well, we can't buy this, it's not worth anything, but we will
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   recycle it for you.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:13.280]   They use strict environmental policies with all of their recyclers, including no export
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   policy.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:20.360]   They don't send the stuff to China where children are taking it apart, as many recyclers do.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.360]   No landfill policy.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.440]   So this stuff is reused.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.240]   They don't use prison labor, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.920]   Cloud Blue is their primary recycling partner today.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.600]   What a great group they are.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.160]   Gazelle, the last four years, people have been recycling their gadgets and getting money
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.560]   for many of them or giving the money to charity.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   And I want you to give it a try.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   We have a special page for you.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:50.680]   If you go to Gazelle.com/macbreak, G-A-Z-E-double-L-E, like the, what is it, a ruminant, like
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   the cloven hoofed Gazelle.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   I got like a home gillot.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.760]   I got a whole box of stuff that I'm starting to put in there.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   Isn't it great?
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   It's getting ready to send me a box.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   Send me a box.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   I'll send you this stuff.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   I'll send you a box of stuff.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Yes, I did.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   If you favicon National Geographic, you do not get that logo.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   What you get is a small picture.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   Go to what I just sent you.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   Go to the ping.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   Go to apple-touch.icon.ping.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.760]   Apple.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   Say that again?
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   Go to the standard ping for iPhone app.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   Go to nationalgraphic.com/apple-touch-icon.ping.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   I'll send it to you.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Well, all I can say is that when you bookmark it and put on your home screen, you get that.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   That's the image.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   You get a thumbnail of the web page that you're actually looking at.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   That's all I can say.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   That's what I got.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   That's what I got on the iPhone.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   But anyway, that's the standard look.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   That is the favicon of iPhones, just for what it's worth.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   And that's the standard that naming is a standard scheme for--
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   Here's somebody in our chat room who did it, and this is the icon they got.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   So I don't know exactly what the difference is.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   That's weird.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   Hang on, let me do that again.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   I just typed nationalgraphic.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   I got the same thing that Andy got.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   I did too.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   All I got was a page.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   Huh.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   Are we all talking on the internet right now?
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   You know what?
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   I bet that guy has an iPad.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   Aha!
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   He's trying to put one over on.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   It's the magic iPad result.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   Okay, first of all, can you tell us now how responsive is the on-screen keyboard?
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   Because I only had about 10 minutes with it.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   Not sure how fast you can type on it.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   Here's the key.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   It has to be the full National Geographic website, not the mobile website.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   Oh, that's handy.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   And then it says when you go to Save Bookmark, you have to give it a minute to load Ping.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.760]   We're going to send in a little tutorial on Apache to National Geographic.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   You know, Andy, when you talked about that, you know what immediately came to my mind?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   Your hometown paper, Boston Globe, they should put the big picture on the iPad.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.760]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   Do you do you look at the big picture?
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   I love the big picture.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   It's just like great high resolution photos.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   They sort of set off a whole genre now, but I think they still do it better than most places.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   But that's one to add to your reader if you're not doing it already.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   Several giant, gorgeous photos.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   Isn't that a smart thing?
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   It's boston.com/bigpicture.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   Isn't that a smart way?
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   This is a newspaper that gets the fact that they need to start driving people to the web.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   And I think so many newspapers in Rupert Murdoch especially are afraid of driving people to the web.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   So, I mean, clearly the big picture makes no sense except if you're online.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:30.360]   I think the hard part was is no one figured out how they were going to make it make sense
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   business-wise.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.360]   How are they going to rationalize it?
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   But they didn't worry about that.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.560]   They said, "Look, we know it's going to be the web.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.760]   Let's get our users going to the web and we'll figure it out after that."
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   But I think it'll be interesting to see how they adopt pictures.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.660]   Like what they do when they're making this content available on the iPad.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:51.460]   Are they going to try to make sure that there is some kind of pay per view before the, you
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:55.660]   know, like keep the web free, keep people coming in there, but putting different content.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   Like how much free content is going to be on the iPad?
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.060]   That's going to be so interesting because I think this is a lot of them are looking in
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.660]   a way to reset that agreement with their users.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.160]   And users get pretty freaky about it.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.660]   You know, CNN charges $1.99 for their iPhone app, but then they hit you with a bunch of ads.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.660]   And if you look at the reviews going down, people are like, "Mmm, that's not a series that
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.660]   there's ads in there.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.660]   I think that's really unclear."
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.660]   I mean, if I pay for it, you know...
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   Hey Leo, try this.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.980]   Leo or Dan or whoever is running that.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.380]   This is another one of my favorite things that people are starting to do.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.300]   Are you on a page like the Shanghai Prepares page?
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.020]   So hit your J and K keys.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.020]   Okay, let's do it.
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.020]   J-J-J-J.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.020]   J-J-J.
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.740]   You mean any page?
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.220]   No, when you're on the bot, yeah.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.220]   So hit J right now.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.220]   J-J-J.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.220]   It goes to the top and scrolls down.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.220]   Yep.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:43.460]   It uses the, like, it uses Unix key commands to basically go fly through a page.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:44.560]   That's awesome.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   There are more pages, more and more places.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.740]   This is Firefox, but is this the website that's doing it?
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.740]   This is UMAF shoot.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.740]   I haven't done HTMLing yet.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:52.740]   You know who does it?
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:53.740]   Gmail does it, so I know it's...
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:54.740]   Yeah, it's a key.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.540]   I think it's called key index, it's the HTML, but it's so handy.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.700]   When you start using this, there's all kinds of sites that are starting to add this now.
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.380]   Then to Alex's point, I mean, I'm not going to rant about this because I ran it a lot
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.060]   in the last week about this, but it depends on what you think the web is there for.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.020]   You know, there are people who see the web as not much more than a source of bleeding for
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.360]   their dying business model, and it's my words.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.520]   But then there are other people who see that the unlimited possibilities of, you know,
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.800]   if your heart is a little more open to where this stuff is going, you know, if the Boston
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.840]   Globe had seen this as nothing but bleeding, they would not be getting thousands and thousands
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.000]   of people who didn't know they existed until they did this.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's mind-boggling.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I completely agree.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.640]   I mean, the thing is though, you got it.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   It's great to have millions and millions of people looking.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.540]   There are millions and millions of people giving you a penny each.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.580]   You know, when you talk to me about New York Times going to a pay model, they're not really
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.180]   talking about not getting it or not really wanting to invest in the web.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.940]   They're talking about the fact that they pay a lot of really great writers and a lot
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.580]   of really great editors doing a lot of really great journals.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.140]   I mean, this is my thesis on this.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.940]   And so that if they have to go to a model where they try to get five bucks a month from
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.060]   people to pay for all that, that's something that they're going to have to do.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:10.020]   I just don't, I think that what gets lost in the shuffle is the idea of saying that,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.860]   well, it's too bad that these newspapers don't get it.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.860]   They get it.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.840]   They just get that they don't want to go to a system where they're just hiring freelancers
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.280]   to give them content as it comes in.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   All right.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   Let me see.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   I'm on the full, I'm on the full.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   Could be true.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.120]   But the other side of that, I mean, my opinion is that I just said this the other day, but
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.200]   I think you don't have revenue until you have traffic and you don't have traffic until
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.520]   you have interest.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.760]   And if you try to put the revenue in front of the traffic, you're going to be SOL.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.280]   And the thing is, you know, I realize that that's a challenging environment.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.660]   I, what you're describing would make sense if they were able to make money off something.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:46.340]   But if you can't make money off anything, then you're going to have to, you're going
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:51.100]   to have to have some, some courageousness about moving into an area that is just promising
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.100]   for now.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.660]   And it means you lose first movie.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.780]   You lose first move or advantage if you don't do that.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.980]   Well, I mean, there are lots of different ways to innovate.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.980]   If you're a car company that wants to continue to make cars, you have to innovate how you
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.180]   operate your business.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.260]   You can't really tell Chrysler that by the way, you're going to be making rice cookers
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.260]   from now on.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.260]   You're a car company.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260]   Yeah, but you're not selling cars.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.680]   So you're going to become a rice cooker company.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.040]   Well, but we have this idea that instead of getting to sales, we get a delete saying,
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.880]   yeah, but really the industry is going into rice cookers.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.400]   You know, well, but I think that there's an opportunity to, to decide, you know, where
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.400]   you're going to put the content.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:25.560]   So for instance, you have, you keep the web free, you keep on doing that, but you have
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:30.580]   a, let's say a free app and a paid at free apps got ton of ads, a paid app doesn't have
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:35.960]   as many or no ads has extra content, has a couple extra pieces there to entice people
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.760]   to go ahead and pay.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.920]   I don't think it has, I think that I think there can be a gradient between, between the
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:47.500]   free version and, you know, successive areas where you can go ahead and people who are
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.720]   really serious about that information who really want to see more of that can see it
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.400]   and people who want free might not have, you know, might not get the same, you know,
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.800]   quite the same amount of content.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.600]   By the way, the only accomplishment that the big picture at Boston dot com has done
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.800]   for me now is make me want to go to Shanghai for the 20th gorgeous.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   Oh my God.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.800]   That's amazing.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800]   I just don't want to be under that during a windstorm.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   That's all.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.440]   The point thing I know, wow, let me just look at these pictures there.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.600]   Hey Dale, look up right now.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.400]   No kidding, but couldn't, wouldn't you?
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.920]   Man, this is going to be good.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.400]   You know, what this really pays off though also is, I mean, that's a get into disaster
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.720]   porn, but whenever something, you know, kind of horrible does happen somewhere like
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   Haiti or, you know, the people know where to go.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.640]   These are, these pictures tell, some of these pictures tell a story that like a hundred
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.960]   of those stupid lightweight cable shows will never be able to tell.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.760]   You know, a really gifted photographer can tell you so much more about what's going
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.520]   on, you know, than some guy in a, you know, slicker standing in the rain.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520]   Look at that.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.440]   I mean, the architecture there is going to be incredible.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   But you're right.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.120]   I think this is the, speaking of national geographic, this was a secret to national
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.080]   geographic was great pictures.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.000]   And it does, one of the things that will translate very well to the web and to the iPad,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.920]   would you rather read a national geographic that could come alive with video and audio
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   as well as history?
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.480]   Here's the thing for me is that, I mean, you know, the only challenge I have is that
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.360]   first 10 minutes when you take off on a plane, but that's when I read most of my magazines.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.280]   And, but I go through, you know, magazines are my primary way of getting information.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.880]   And so whether it's wired or the economist or, and the thing is, is I got a big stack
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   of them.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.800]   And what's, what's great to me is this idea that I can get extra, I can have audio and
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.920]   video, but I can all have them in one place.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.480]   I have one little iPad that is going to be sitting there holding, you know, and, and
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.560]   I can see myself subscribing to a lot more magazines than I did before.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.480]   NPR's already said they're going to do an iPad app that's a different app from the iPhone
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   app.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   I can't.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.480]   I'm so excited.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.120]   And you already love, you know, you very glad that the, the on app, Wall Street Journal
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.680]   says they are going to launch on launch day with a Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.000]   Especially that specific flash free page.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.680]   If these, if the magazines really embrace this and, and also take into account that
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.480]   they're saving a lot of money by not having to cut down trees to send us stuff and make
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.400]   it more affordable for us to get really cool content that's in there.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.120]   Uh, you know, I could see myself like I buy iPhone apps all the time.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.920]   I just think I'll try it as a $2 or whatever.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.880]   If it's inexpensive, uh, if I'm able to get a one year subscription for $10 or $12.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.520]   And by the way, I'm getting a one year subscription of wired for wired for, for $10.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.600]   I mean, you know, so it's, it's not that it's, uh, outside of the boundary, but if it's
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.440]   in that inexpensive rate, I could definitely see myself subscribing to more magazines than
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.920]   I'm ever going to be able to make it through.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.280]   I think what they really have to do is hook into the, one of the greatest benefits that
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.360]   newspapers and magazines have right now is that Amazon has spent the past couple of
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.720]   years training the marketplace to pay money for books to sort of break them out of the
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.960]   idea of yes, you're downloading a piece of written printed content.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.640]   Yes, you're reading it on a mobile device like your iPhone, but it's not the web.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.640]   You didn't get it for free.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.720]   So in our pack, you paid $17 for this, but that's because this is a professionally produced
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.760]   product that went, a lot of research went into it, a lot of editing went into it.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.600]   And you're going to get a very, very long immersive experience instead of just dipping
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.120]   in and out randomly.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.880]   If they have now the ability to simply say, we are not selling you a web page.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.720]   We are selling you a really big detailed book of the New York Times today that has every
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.000]   article that was published in it that has lots of content you're not going to get otherwise
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   for it.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.840]   Yes, it's not on the web, but we're giving you something better than the web from their
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.400]   perspective, it's a version of the web where you pay a $0.75 for it.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.400]   You're totally right.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.480]   And I think you've, in both of you, in the passing of nailed two things that make this
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.000]   stuff either hard or difficult for me, depending on how well it's done.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.040]   Two things I think of, I think about when I got this as a premium from PBS or something,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:46.120]   but I ended up getting the entire history of the New Yorker on CDs or DVDs.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.120]   And it was the most unbelievably giant pain in the ass to use.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   Yes.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.600]   I mean, it was really, I'm sorry to say I love the New Yorker and I was looking forward
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.360]   to sitting down and being able to select like this Dorothy Parker thing, this Robert
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.280]   Benchley thing, all these things that I could take with me.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.080]   And they, it was, I don't want to overstate it, but it was very, very difficult to use
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.120]   and you were stuck with their little reader.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.040]   So number one, the accessibility and usability part.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.560]   Number two, my gosh, I subscribed is the day I got my Kindle, my first generation Kindle,
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.080]   I think I subscribed to three or four magazines and I canceled them all the next, the next
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   day.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Me too.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.120]   It was so not fun to read.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.840]   So A, the usability and very related B, the design.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.600]   There are some websites that are so fun to use on the iPhone and others that are just
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.960]   so bad.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.280]   I think if you, I mean, this sounds so obvious, but if you start designing your content for
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.920]   this device or to at least be friendly on this device, it can be totally immersive.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.600]   You know, like for me, like I say, a wiki panyon using an app like wiki panyon.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.280]   It's so much more fun to use that app because it's made for the iPhone than to just dither
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.440]   around on the mobile site.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.560]   And I think if they want to, at least for, I'll speak for myself, if they want to succeed
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.920]   with people like me who, and I do pay a lot for content of all kinds, it, you know, it
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.280]   really, I'd like to see the care that you decided to make a parallel product for this
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.520]   device rather than just trying to poop out something from your back catalog that you
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.880]   threw a bunch of DRM at.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.480]   I think this is not a product.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   That's, you know, that's an embarrassment.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.680]   Well, I think this is a challenge for, this is really a big challenge for Adobe too,
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.200]   because I think they are going to spend a lot of time putting the extra care into
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   the iPad version.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.080]   And then the iPad version is going to get way ahead of everything else.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.480]   And then they're not going to be sure that's worth the engineering resources to do that
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   again in Flash.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.840]   And I think that's the concern that Adobe has.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.480]   I think it's a concern that a lot of the pad manufacturers have.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.320]   They have to put these out now because if they don't, if they don't, if the Dell and
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.680]   the HP and everything else don't put them out now and there isn't a development platform
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.560]   for them and Apple has 90% of the market, you get into that.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.400]   Why should we, if we're already making all this money and it all works, why should we
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.640]   go into something else?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.160]   And I think that's going to be one of the challenges.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.480]   But I think that I would, by the way, with the National Geographic, the more I think about
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:59.680]   it, what I want to buy is the entire history of National Geographic in an iPhone and an
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.920]   iPad app.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.080]   I would, I'd pay $200 for that.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.360]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.600]   If you could, I mean, that's maybe a good argument for getting those bigger memory ones,
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.440]   because if you could get it, to me part of the product with the New Yorker, the National
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.480]   Geographic is swapping those stupid DVDs.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.280]   If I could have it all in one place.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280]   Oh, it's like six of them.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.640]   To be able to search across it, you could easily get that onto a 64 gigabyte.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.520]   You're reminding me of what I used to use all this page maker on AM.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.120]   You want to swap, swap this.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   And I have to shook, shook, shook, shook, shook.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.720]   No, but that's, I think that's where we're looking at iPad really being a transformation.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   Oh man.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.920]   I mean, just think of the, what got me into Africa in the first place was when I was,
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.200]   you know, 10 years old, I inherited some 1927, 1928 graphics from my great grandmother.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.080]   And, and I was, it was when they were just discovering it and there's so much, I mean,
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.600]   National Geographic has been such a, a tome of information, you know, for so long that
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.120]   it would be, I would just, I'd love to just, I just have that.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.520]   I don't know if I'd read anything else if I had the whole, you know, what I really
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.320]   love if they would, especially these, these magazines that have like a 50, 60, 70, 80,
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.560]   90 year history, if they just had a policy where they're putting it all on, all in a
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.160]   purchasable library and every issue is always at their original cover price.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.600]   So if you want to buy like a 1908 profit by a great, great idea.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.160]   If you want to buy last month, it's $7.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.360]   A nickel for 1908.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   That'd be awesome.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.920]   Hey, we have to move along and there's quite a few other stories.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.280]   Let me do a quick rundown and you can give us your quick reaction to him.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.720]   Fake Steve Jobs working on a TV show.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:29.320]   It'll be called Icon, Dan Lyons, the show will be directed by comic genius Larry Charles,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.280]   who did Seinfeld, of course, Kirby enthusiasm, Borat.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.800]   He's overseeing the script.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.840]   The lead character is called Tom Rhodes.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.720]   I'm not sure how that relates to Steve Jobs.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.160]   He's supposed to be designed around him.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160]   Maybe he runs a...
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.480]   You couldn't really call him anything.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.160]   You couldn't, you'd have to be very disguised to get away with that.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   Right.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.400]   Any reactions to that?
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.280]   I wish I were Steve, not Steve, the fake Steve Jobs.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   No.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.240]   God, all the work he's getting off of this.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   No kidding.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   No kidding.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.040]   Actually, though, it's a web only release.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.320]   So I think this is going to be like another doctor horrible.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.360]   It sounds like where it's not going to be another thing.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:11.320]   If it were like an NBC show or an HBO show, it seems like another really cool idea where
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.520]   someone who's an established producer and established creator is using some of his
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   own money to...
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   Let's see how that works out.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520]   ...or it's going to use some...
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.080]   A lesser amount of money to say, "Well, let's do something small that might work better."
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:25.240]   And this is the sort of idea that wouldn't really work as a '22 episode, a season series.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.480]   But if you want to do six web episodes that are really, really well chosen, that could
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   be cool.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   That could be kind of cool.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.800]   Apple has announced there is an iPad battery replacement service.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.360]   It's like for the iPhone and the iPod.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.800]   99 bucks plus 6.95 shipping.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.520]   It's not just like it, though.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.480]   Aren't they saying that they're going to replace the whole iPad?
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.120]   Yeah, that's kind of the weird thing.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.360]   I'm not sure if that's...
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360]   They have to.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.360]   I guess they do.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360]   I don't know.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.440]   Well, it might be so packaged in there that there's just no other way to do it.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   But it seems like they would be either the iPad costs a lot less than we were calculating
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:59.720]   to make and they're making a lot of money on it or they're losing every time you replace
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.720]   a battery.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   Well, no.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.920]   Or you're not going to walk out with a brand new iPad.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.080]   They're going to have...every Apple store will have like a...well, mail off the 12 iPads
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   they got this month.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080]   That's probably right.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.440]   It gets sent back more refurbished ones with new batteries installed.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.800]   They'll just do that from the swap out.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.800]   And the reason they're swapping is so you know your data will not come back.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.800]   Well, the...
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.080]   Well, the...I guess the other thing that you could theoretically do is you could sell
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.640]   those refurbs for $150 or $200 or whatever down the road and make...I think people would
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.920]   be a little peeved if they were trading their iPad in and getting a refurbished one back.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.000]   But I think that they got a new one back and then Apple has a refurbished program that
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.320]   offsets the cost and you have all...want people buying them for $200 or whatever.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320]   That would probably work fine.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.160]   I do think you'll be getting back from a pool of other iPads that have had their batteries
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.160]   swapped out.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.480]   I also see this more as a PR thing than anything else.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.920]   I think that they're going through the list of all the complaints that people are doing
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   about the iPad.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   They're doing have about the iPad.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   And they can say...
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Come on.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   Okay, fine.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.080]   You get 20% of your battery life on your iPad.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.080]   Come on in.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   Give us 100 damn bucks.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.080]   We'll swap out your entire iPad for you with a brand new battery.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   Okay.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.560]   No, it's pro...it's it being proactive.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   It's great.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.560]   They've been in the bud.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560]   Yep.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.240]   And I don't know if you saw the New York Times article about the feud breaking out into
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.960]   a red hot war, which we've been talking about for some time between Eric Schmidt at Google
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.720]   and Apple.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.360]   And lots, though, of research and behind the scenes, deep background interviews with venture
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.640]   capitalists, people at Apple.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.160]   And it sounds like it's been rancorous for some time, really, really ugly.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.520]   I have to admit that if I had worked with Google really closely and then they went off
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.600]   and made a phone that did a lot of the stuff that I had been working on with them, I'd
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   be pissed.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   In Google's...
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.120]   Depending on themselves saying, "No, no, we were all of this stuff.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.040]   We thought of this before the iPhone came out."
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   Yeah, I would have been.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040]   I'd be really pissed.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.840]   I'd be like, "What the guy sitting on your board who's getting all that secret information?"
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   I'd be pissed.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Leaves the board.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840]   Also, remember that...
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.760]   Do you remember what the first prototypes of...
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.160]   The first time that Google was releasing images of what their Android operating system looked
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.360]   like, it looked like a Blackberry.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   It looked like a trio.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.160]   It did not look like an iPhone.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.720]   But everybody who's released a phone, you know, a smartphone in the last two years has made
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720]   it look like the iPhone.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720]   You don't have to be on the board of directors.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720]   I know.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.200]   If you're sitting on the board of directors, there's a certain level of, "Okay, you're
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.840]   going to play in your field and we're going to play in our field and we're not going to...
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.360]   Well, that's kind of what Steve Jobs was saying.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.160]   Wasn't he at that all-hands meeting?
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.200]   He says, "We didn't go after Google for search.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.840]   They went after us for the iPhone."
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   Right.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   I think there's...
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.520]   I think there's pretty much clear this.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520]   You know what, though?
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.520]   I bet that's a little bit of a cipher.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.520]   Yeah, sure.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.080]   There's obviously going to be a lot of head-butting on that.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.120]   But I bet that's something more like what?
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.200]   If I knew more about history, I'd say something something Neville Chamberlain.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   There's probably something...
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.280]   No, but I mean, this is probably...
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.440]   This is just the beginning of a much bigger fight.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   I bet where...
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   Oh, you know what?
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   This is...
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Okay, how about the sinking of the main?
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   Does that work?
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Kind of?
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   World War I?
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.440]   I don't remember the main.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   Spanish-American, American War.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.440]   You don't remember the main?
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440]   Do you remember the LMO at all?
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.440]   You're supposed to remember the main.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440]   I know.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   I don't remember.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440]   I remember the main.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   I remember the...
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.240]   Mother desperately being swept out to see Holt clutching her dead infant.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.120]   That didn't move you in any way.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.040]   That was a documentary campaign poster.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.640]   Not propaganda, sir.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   Aha!
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   One picture speaks about it.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.400]   I bet that this is the leading edge of something that's going to be much more profound
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   and serious.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.280]   You know, this might be a little bit of pissing match about a friendship that's gone sour
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.280]   and some copying.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.480]   I don't think Apple has that much to worry about for now in terms of the iPhone being
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   copied.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.480]   I mean, it's...
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.640]   You know, they're tracing shadows.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.520]   If you can't come up with that interaction with the way the software works with the hardware...
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.920]   I think Apple can use those patents to keep everyone behind.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.280]   I mean, I think that's what they're going to do is that it doesn't matter whether they
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.280]   win or lose.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.080]   It's just a matter of how long they can keep the question mark open.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.600]   I know if I'm a user, I don't know if I really want to buy into it because I don't know
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.400]   whether it's going to be there or not.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:53.440]   But see, the level of trash talk is escalated by a level of five or ten.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.440]   Like, do you...
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.200]   I think everybody read like the comments from Tim Braig just got hired by Google.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.000]   And it's like, and it's the most like college freshmen posting to their live journal because
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.520]   they just found out that white people control everything and isn't that horrible.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   It's like...
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   It's like...
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   What was it?
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]   The...
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]   Did you know the poor jobs are made of the mobile units?
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:19.880]   The high-fose version of the mobile internet's future amidst controversy, sex and freedom.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.560]   I thought it was a very well-written post.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.920]   But we can know and who can say what.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.040]   Oh, I thought it was a well-written post from the guy who invented CSS, you know what I mean?
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.840]   Now, a Google employee went to Apple.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.720]   And I didn't see this because he tweeted, "It's been great working for Google, had a
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.120]   great time, next step, Apple."
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.960]   And then the Twitter was taken down.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.280]   So, I guess it goes both ways, you know.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.760]   It depends on what company, what kind of company you want to work for.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   I don't know that.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.800]   I mean, I know a lot of people that work both, but just on the face of it, those are two
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.280]   companies that are...
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.040]   Their next five years are going to have a lot of overlap from a consumer standpoint.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.840]   But the problems that those companies face are going to be fairly different, I think.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   I mean, there's some things...
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.760]   I mean, Apple did try to get into Google's business.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.480]   They tried to buy AdMob for 600 million.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.280]   Well, there's an app that I get started though.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280]   I mean, that was...
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.560]   And Apple, by the way, it sounds like they just fumbled that.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.360]   I mean, they just literally had them on a hold for 45 days and just let it run out for
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.360]   whatever reason.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.600]   And they had offered 600 million.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.960]   Google swept in and said, "We'll give you 750."
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.280]   Well, that might be just trying to take a bishop off the table.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.080]   You know, I mean, sometimes those sorts of things are just as somebody else can't have.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.320]   I don't know the details of that.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.080]   I just mean in the sense of the directions that they're going, there's enough money involved
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.240]   in the areas where they do clash that we're going to compare them on those terms.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.040]   But you know, you think about what each company is actually selling and what they're each
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.640]   actually making money off of, they're pretty different kinds of things.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.000]   Google right now, Google's not a tech company, they're an ad company.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.840]   I think that I personally think it was a tactical error on Google's part because I think that
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.040]   the issue is that I think that they would have done better to find a way to work with
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.000]   Apple to get what they wanted out of the relationship.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.120]   And maybe it would have been difficult.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   Maybe it would have been painful.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.040]   But now they have to bet against Apple because what they're guaranteed is that they'll never
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.040]   get in there.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.320]   You know, and then the thing is Apple's going to work them out.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:13.880]   You know, the thing is, I mean, historically, I think what we found is that, you know, Steve
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.240]   holds a grudge fairly well.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:23.240]   And you know, you know, the thing is that forever, you know, the, the, I think that the
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.040]   issue that they've done is they picked a fight with a Viper, you know, and the thing,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.400]   and, and, and I don't know, I just know that if I was running a company, I wouldn't pick
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.840]   a fight with someone like that.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.880]   I'd find a way, no matter how difficult it was, to find a way to work my way into that
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.400]   system and make sure I was part of that system, not, you know, pick one, pick a fight.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.840]   And I think that this is going to, it could really cost them a lot down the road.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.760]   If Apple gets, if Apple keeps on growing the way it's growing and starts shutting them
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.840]   out of everything, it's going to be a real problem for their search engine.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.480]   All right.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.880]   We're going to go to our picks of the week in just a little bit before we do that.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:03.760]   It's time to mention our friends at audible.com or pick of the week at audible.com.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.280]   We do this every week.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.520]   Audible is a great place to get your audio books, 70,000 books, radio shows, comedy performances.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.040]   You know, many of the hosts here at Twitter are audible fans.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.000]   I know I am and he is.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.360]   We listen to our books because there's, and I know Alex is too, because there are plenty
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.560]   of times when we want to read, we just can't get reading done.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.040]   I never want to read.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.360]   I want the animation.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.600]   I want, I want, yeah, not anymore.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.080]   I was talking to a listener of ours, Francine Hardaway.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.080]   She said, I had stopped reading and then I got an audible subscription because I heard
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.280]   about it on the show.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.520]   And now I read all the time, we call it reading, but it's really listening because how much
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.120]   time do you spend in the car every day or at the gym?
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.920]   If I add that up, that's probably an hour or two of reading every single day.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.840]   And it's just great too because I listen to these books and I just love them.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.880]   Now we thought because it's Jerry Lewis's birthday, we could recommend this book, which
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.920]   you have recommended before both Andy and Merlin.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.320]   Unfortunately, it's only abridged.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.280]   Although, you know, I mean, I see, I was looking at the listing.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.880]   It's only three hours.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.640]   It's only three hours, but seems like a very, very short version of this book.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.040]   Also it's narrated by Marty Ingalls.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.960]   See, I thought that was a selling point.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   Was it, I don't know.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   I don't know.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   I don't know.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.400]   I was wrong about Paul Schafer.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.560]   When Paul Schafer was now reading his own memoir a few months ago, I was like, oh, do I really
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.360]   want to listen to this void in my ear for six hours and 45 minutes?
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.040]   I don't think so, but you get into it.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   I'm not sure.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040]   Well, here's Marty Ingalls.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.000]   Hey, it's in roachary and a absurdly long memo.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.800]   Also the clip, by the way, is in very, very low quality.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.400]   They have much higher quality on these books, including the new enhanced format, which is
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.720]   perfect quality.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.200]   I don't know.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.880]   I've already, I listened to this and you know what I did?
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   I went out and I bought the book.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.800]   And I think sometimes I do that with Audible that I fall in love with the book from listening,
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.400]   and then I go out and get the full version.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   And I did do that.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   What do you do?
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   There's the full version.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.640]   Do you put it on your shelf so that what's right now it's sitting in front of you?
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.080]   You got this after you got the Audible.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   Why would you do that?
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Because I listened to the abridged and I wanted the fridge.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   The fridge is bridged.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:18.080]   I mean, so just tell me, did the Audible version have the story about Jerry Lewis bugging
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.320]   his son's bedroom secretly?
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   Yes.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.000]   And after he spanked his kids, he would run to his private office, locked the door and
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   listen to what his kids were saying about him.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.040]   The most bizarre story in the whole book.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   His locked after it has the story.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.280]   He doesn't even have the story because he's more bizarre than that.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.760]   Because as soon as you're like, wow, this is Jerry Lewis guy, he's got issues.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.240]   Then you find out that no, we know about this because he talked about this on like the Dick
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.400]   Cavitch show as an example of like how good a parent he is.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.920]   And what I knew I'd done the right thing, Dick, because the last thing my boy said was
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.760]   that he was glad that I had done it because it would make him stronger.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.640]   And that's the sort of, you know, it's one of those things you just can't turn away from.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   I think it's a great book.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   I would, you know, look, you don't have to get this.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.520]   The good news is you've got 70,000 books to choose from.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.080]   And most of them could be yours for free.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   You get a credit.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.880]   What we're talking about is joining the Audibles, a gold subscription plan.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.760]   They have a gold and platinum subscription plan.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.080]   The gold plan is one book a month.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.360]   And the first one's free if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can cancel it anytime and keep
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.360]   that book.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.280]   So maybe, yeah, maybe you don't want to use your credit on a three hour bridge book,
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.000]   but there are plenty of other wonderful books to choose from.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.040]   And that's one of the things I love about listening to audio books from Audible.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.360]   What are you listening to, Andy?
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.280]   Right now, actually, before I get to that, I just now noticed that the pick of the week
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:45.080]   for last week, the Big Burn, Teddy Roosevelt and the fire of the Save America is on sale.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.040]   Normally 1469, as a member now, it's 495.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.240]   They do that a lot, too.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.200]   200 books are now 495.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.080]   And I'm deep into it right now.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.880]   And I'm like, oh, I might have to buy this.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.880]   This might have to be one of those books that I actually buy digitally afterward because
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.520]   I want to reread it.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.520]   It was a really good book.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.280]   I just want to miss that in passing to people who maybe don't want to spend their wedding.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.280]   They're win-win sale.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.880]   I'm not sure what that means, but I guess...
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.600]   Well, the reader gets a good book.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.600]   The author gets a royalty.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.440]   That's the win-win for me.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:19.160]   So this one is I rarely recommend fiction only because I rarely read fiction.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160]   I'm mostly into nonfiction.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.720]   So this is a book that I saw on the shelf.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.000]   I knew it was coming out.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.880]   I read the first chapter in the bookstore and decided that, yeah, I'm going to have
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.240]   to look into this.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.920]   It is Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:40.080]   It is written by the same guy who wrote Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.840]   And so it's about to become a major motion picture near you, I'm sure.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   Exactly.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.680]   This is the movie that I want to see because it purports to be the secret journal of Abraham
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:56.200]   Lincoln because it turns out that there was a vampire menace in the United States that
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.560]   was referred to as the milk sickness.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.200]   His mother died of the milk sickness and he decided to commit his life much like Batman
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.600]   to killing and destroying vampires for the rest of his life.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:14.720]   So he was indeed, all of our history is still true, but it's now been sort of like the
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.800]   unspoken parts of Abraham Lincoln's life and presidency have now been fleshed out considerably
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.400]   by his desire to whack vampires in the skull with axes.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.360]   It's embroidered with historical photos and other documentation to basically make sure
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.040]   you understand exactly what the vampire menace was like during the Civil War and the years
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.040]   beforehand.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.200]   I read the first chapter and it was, I was like, okay, sold American.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.160]   That's great.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.600]   It's great when you see an author is able to bring history to life like this.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.240]   And this is how you're going to get the kids interested in history.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.960]   Now they're going to fail miserably when they write about this and they're for their
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.480]   term papers and history class, but at least they'll be able to spell Lincoln correctly,
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.000]   I think, after this.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   I love it.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.680]   Amazon, I'm sorry, Audible, it is owned by Amazon, but it's audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:11.800]   And you can get Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter, or you could get the King of Comedy, or one
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.720]   of 70,000 other titles, but you get that first book free and we invite you to give it a try.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.560]   We know you're going to love Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.640]   And it is time for our picks of the week.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.920]   And I'm going to start because when I was at South by Southwest, I met throwboy.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:34.960]   You throwboy is just a guy who started making pillows.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.320]   He said, I think it was for his girlfriend.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.280]   And he started with a Macintosh icon.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.760]   And now if you go to throwboy.com, you can get a Macintosh pillow.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.840]   You can get an iChat pillow.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.280]   You can get the little speedometer pillow there.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.480]   That's from that's dashboard, right?
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.000]   You can make a whole dock with pillows.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   You can get a whole dock.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.800]   That wouldn't be geeky at all.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:06.360]   And I talked to him and I said, he made this one off for me, the twit pillow at throwboy.com.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.640]   But I licensed it.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.560]   I said, dude, make as many as you want.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.360]   So at some point, they're going to have these as well.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.960]   He makes them by-- well, I guess he's got some seamstresses now.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.920]   But he started, he made them by hand himself.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920]   That's awesome.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.920]   Really nice guy.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.040]   And I just think this is-- if you're a Mac fanatic, having a Macintosh pillow, an iChat
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:33.280]   pillow, and a photo booth pillow on your couch, just would be so cool, wouldn't it?
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.960]   He's also got Chris Perrillo pillows.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   Yep.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   That's a little scary.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:42.840]   Chat pillows, O-M-G-W-T-F-L-O-L-F-T-W.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.880]   He's got an RSS pillow and soon to be added a twit pillow as well.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   It's throwboy.com.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.440]   And they're not very expensive.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.440]   And they're real-- and you know what?
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.440]   They're pretty nice.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.080]   Here, take a gander there.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080]   Perfect for the airplane.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   Isn't that great?
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.080]   We're doing-- yeah.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.080]   We're doing-- we're doing-- yeah.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.080]   --twit-are-y-all-ready.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:03.280]   Yeah, while you're listening to it, you can lie on the twit pillow.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:08.200]   Also known as the Andy started talking about something that interests him pillow.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.640]   No, Andy, we love you!
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:16.440]   But people don't understand about the TRS-8 and MOMA 100 because it was innovative for
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.720]   its time because-- I love that you enjoy your computers.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720]   I think it's part of your job.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.560]   I mean, that's why people listen.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.200]   It's because you and I talk too much.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.200]   That's really--
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   It's all right.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   Again?
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200]   I can say, Andy, I said this.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.080]   I said this to somebody just the other day.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.480]   One of my favorite things on this show, apart from my love and the giving and the thing of
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.280]   you guys, is I love your--
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.760]   And I don't think enough people notice.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:45.320]   I know about the love and the give, the where you wear yourself out for these kids, Merlin.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.680]   This today is an environment in which somebody who is a genius and has given and who writes
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.480]   and directs and invents technology is not getting the do vis-a-vis people in the world
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.120]   who aren't consuming that and then seeing with these children what I do for them every
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.120]   year.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.480]   It's very scary that you guys are so good at this and I'm wondering how many--
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.280]   Merlin, I celebrate you and I greet you.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.000]   How many telethons you guys actually watched?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.480]   You must memorize this stuff.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.400]   See, I'm the kind of guy that I see the telephone.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.960]   I go, "Okay, I gotta go somewhere else."
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.320]   People don't understand how wonderful the very Lewis telethon-- because it was the last
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.440]   big TV show you got to watch for you when it's back to school for the year.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.320]   The first-- your mom and your dad wanted to watch it too so it was the entire family
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.800]   around the TV set and it was like two and a half hours-- the first two and a half hours
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.280]   were-- it started off with something incredibly grotesquely in bad taste which was all Jerry
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]   Lewis's idea.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.040]   Like a little pantomime clown skit about how horrible this disease was.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.080]   And then two and a half hours of-- you got your Frank Sinatra, you got your Sammy Davis
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.760]   Jr., you got your--
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760]   I feel--
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.440]   After the shows, after that's the thing is you'd have all this crap and you'd have
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.720]   all these people with twirling batons and stuff and then after the midnight show, they'd come
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.280]   out and they'd be lit and you get Sammy and you get in the back in the day before they
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.000]   reconciled in '76 of course via Frank Sinatra.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.600]   They-- you know, Dino would come out and Joey Bishop and that was-- it was amazing and if
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.720]   you could stay up that late, man, it was magic.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   Good times.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.160]   Boy, I'll tell you that'll break your heart and you know what?
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.280]   The thing about Jerry is that when he and Dean got together on that stage in 1976, he
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:18.080]   sent-- was it monogrammed lighters to Frank and Dean and you know they never mended that
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   friendship and that broke--
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   The break's Jerry's heart.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   Broke his heart.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080]   This day.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.600]   Also, he never wears the same pair of socks twice.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.640]   Yeah, and he was very, very generous, man.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.920]   I mean, he would give you a Rolex at the drop of a hat.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.920]   Yep.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920]   Just, you know, you don't even have to ask.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.400]   He'd just say, here, take my watch.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.400]   He loved his watches.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400]   Please.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.480]   Jerry, not that we're in that for monogrammed Rolexes because for us, it's all about the
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.240]   Jerry love and the respect and the honor.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.800]   See, now if I do a Jerry Lewis imitation, it's really an imitation of Andy and Merlin doing
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   their Jerry Lewis imitation.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.200]   I do that with Randy Newman.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.960]   I basically imitate that guy from Mad TV.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.040]   My Randy Newman sounds like him.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.360]   So I mean, I think that's reasonable.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   You can do a meta impersonation.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.600]   That's how I learned really how to do all my impersonations was impersonating the other
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.600]   neighbors.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   Right, exactly.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.600]   Because they went through all the problems.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.600]   They exaggerated.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.600]   Yes.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.640]   Figuring out what the important pieces of that were.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.040]   And then you just steal it from me.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.040]   Yeah, I mean, like, you know, it's like--
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   Absolutely.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.840]   But it's a little derivative because I sound, you know, when I do, you know, Jimmy Kagnie,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840]   I'm really doing Frank Gorshen doing Jimmy Kagnie.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.080]   Oh, he does a good one.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080]   The Riddler.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.080]   He does a good one.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   The Riddler, baby.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.040]   Well, actually, no, that's Edward G Robinson.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.040]   But I'm doing Chief Wigam.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.440]   You're doing Chief Wigam.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   Exactly.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.440]   Exactly.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.440]   Is that what that is?
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440]   Yeah, I think it's area.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   But you're doing extremely--
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440]   Where's God now?
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440]   Wow.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.520]   Red Stapler says in our chat room, I can imitate Jerry by giving Red Stapler a Rolex.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.520]   That's a thought.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520]   That's nice.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.160]   Your pick, Alex Lindsay.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.920]   So my pick is the opposite of the audible pick.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   Okay.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.920]   It's a audible.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.960]   So it's an audio book that's written.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.480]   It's actually writing by talking.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.760]   Writing by talking.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   So here's the deal.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.560]   The guys from New Orleans were here in the office.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.640]   Remember, they were visiting.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.440]   Yes, they're brilliant.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.440]   They went to Dragon.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.920]   They went to Dragon Naturally Speaking.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   They own them all.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.360]   And so they sent me a copy of Dragon, which I fell in love with.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360]   Very good.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   I fell in love with.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.360]   And here's the--
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   That's a Windows program.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   Right.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   Max Speech is the Mac version.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360]   Right.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.480]   So I am-- in the back story is I've never really-- I haven't been able to type for more
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.240]   than 15 or 20 minutes at a time since the mid 90s.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.240]   Your wrists hurt?
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.240]   Oh, no.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.400]   I burned up my arms in IOM when I was working at Star Wars.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   And it took a couple weeks off.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   Wow.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.480]   And did lots of acupuncture and took a lot of drugs and got it all kind of to a point
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   where I could work.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   So I can do a little bit here and there.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.680]   It's funny because I took a lot of drugs and now I can't work.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.640]   So anyway, the-- so I'm able to-- you know, I can type for 10 or 15-- a good 10 or 15
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.960]   minutes, but it's really hard.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.280]   You know, long articles are real painful, which is why I don't write much.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.080]   And why I do podcasts.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.400]   And so-- or part of the reason.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.040]   And so-- so anyway, this has been a mural issue.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.920]   And now that I'm writing more and more, I'm doing less production, it's become more of
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.920]   an issue.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.960]   And so I really dug into the dragon software that they sent and it was just-- took me
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.360]   a little while to think about how to talk that way.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.440]   You know, say, comma space, you know, or not space, but comma and the next thing, period,
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.960]   new paragraph, all that stuff.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   Fell in love with it.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.200]   And then, of course, now, Mac speech was bought by nuance.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.120]   And I was already talking to some of the guys over there.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.640]   And so they sent me dictate, which I-- which I started testing.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.360]   So Mac speech dictate works on your Mac.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360]   And it is-- it's awesome.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   It's the same engine.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   It's the same engine as dragon.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360]   It's like magic.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   It doesn't have-- really?
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360]   Is it that good?
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   Because every time I've tried these things--
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.840]   Well, compared to any other speech recognition you've ever done on a Mac, it's magic.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.000]   We still have to-- yeah, I mean, I do it.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.680]   We're all like export from a digital recorder.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   And it gets an astounding amount of it.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.760]   See, my point is, I guess, if it's 95% accurate, that's fine, but that means one in 20 words,
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.760]   you have to fix.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.760]   So there's a lot of stuff.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   I'm less accurate than Mac speech when I'm typing.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   OK, well, there you go.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.360]   So it's amazing I get anything done.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:49.800]   So anyway, the-- but the-- it runs over top of your apps.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   You turn it on.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800]   You have a little stop sign.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800]   You hit the stop sign.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.800]   You hit go.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.080]   And you start writing stuff.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.560]   And I have fairly good diction when I'm doing it.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.560]   And I have a good mic.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.360]   I have a Plantronics 655 that I'm using with it.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.960]   And I have a fairly quiet room.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.600]   Those are all things that contribute to a-- you know, you do have a-- you do have a
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.800]  -- you do have to know how the computer wants to listen to you.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.080]   And you do have to enunciate.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.560]   But when you do that, I'm really surprised at how good it is.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.400]   And even if I have to go back and correct, the amount of information that I can get down
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:26.240]   is at least four or five times what I was typing before, you know, without running out
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.600]   of steam.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.840]   So it's really, really cool.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   Mac speech dictate.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.840]   And they have a bunch of other things.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840]   How much is it, though?
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.840]   I think it's like 149.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.840]   Well, that's not bad.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.400]   Yeah, it's not-- it's not very expensive.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.280]   I mean, for speech dictation, that can be very expensive.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.160]   Well, and there's-- they have specialty versions.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.960]   And so if you're a doctor or a lawyer, you know, like my father has been dictating to
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.600]   a-- to a assistant for 30 years, so I'm sure that he would just sit down and just jam right
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.600]   through this.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.960]   I mean, you know, because he knows-- he's very comfortable.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:00.120]   The biggest thing for me was getting-- getting used to saying, you know, period, space.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.360]   And then also, I realized how much I think while I'm typing.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.280]   So you know, you know, there's a different-- it's like my--
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.480]   my brain is in my fingers to some degree.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:12.480]   And so I'm trying to, like, regear how I'm coming up with the sentences, you know, comes
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.880]   out differently than if I had typed.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:19.520]   But I am not going back to-- just like I'm not going back to books when I got-- when
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   I really got into Audible, I'm not going back to typing anything of mass with my fingers.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   I'm done.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.520]   Done.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   I'm passionate.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   Let's see, you know what it does?
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.160]   Alex, when I started thinking about it, I bought it because I've said this before that
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:37.000]   I think, you know, typing versus writing versus talking, you know, they're all different
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   kind of modes.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.160]   It's kind of stimulate different parts of your creativity.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.480]   I use it to basically capture our first draft.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.920]   It's as good as my free writing is in terms of spelling punctuation.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:47.920]   It's close enough.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.840]   And you know what you could do, a suggestion.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.800]   I mean, this is a little more money, but you could just talk as fast as you want and basically
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:01.000]   send-- I'm thinking you could take your 90%, 95% write version and throw it on mechanical
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   turk and have somebody correct if you would have--
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.040]   It would be a lot cheaper than full transcription.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.760]   I actually have people at the company that correct most of what I do, whether I type
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.760]   it or not.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.080]   Well, my-- you have editors.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.280]   I have people who edit everything because my dyslexia is so bad that there's words spread
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.520]   out all over the place.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:23.400]   So the thing is that it doesn't-- you know, people have to pass through anything that
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.840]   I'm writing anyway.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.480]   So the key is what's been hard is me getting that first draft down.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.640]   And because it's internal training and it's internal business plans and stuff, that's
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   been--
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640]   So you usually don't want to send it out of class?
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.240]   Instead of writing almost all the time?
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.240]   Now I am.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:39.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.480]   And what I was doing with Dragon-- so with Dragon, what I would do for all the text, before
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   we put it into pages, it would sit in Google Docs.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:51.040]   And so I would use Dragon on the PC side in Google Docs and I would just write the entire--
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.640]   I started writing all the drafts that I was working on.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.840]   And then I would let everybody else edit it in Google Docs.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.920]   And then I would cut and paste it out of Google Docs into pages and then do all the formatting
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:03.680]   that I want to do because I don't like doing the other stuff in Google Docs.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.200]   But it was great for everyone to kind of collaboratively-- because it's not-- they're
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.240]   not just the people that are at the company doing it.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.480]   They're not just editing it.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.800]   They're not fixing things.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.440]   They're actually saying, you know, we ought to change this and edit this and move this.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   And why don't we add this?
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.560]   And so it's not exactly-- they're fixing what I'm writing.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.680]   They're actually improving the thought process.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.600]   It's not a fix it type of thing.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.680]   So we could collaboratively work on it in Google Docs.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.280]   I really wish the pages was collaborative like Google Docs, but it's not.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.680]   So we just cut and paste it out and then put it into pages and then make it look pretty
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.680]   good.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.440]   Could you do that with iWork with that iWork service that you can't edit?
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.440]   With iWork.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.000]   So everyone can look at it, but they can't edit it.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000]   That's handy.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.360]   Well, you know, I think it's a step in the right direction.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.080]   I can't imagine, especially when you look at what they're doing with the iPad, you know,
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:50.160]   I can't imagine we're not going to get something like that.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.160]   But I think that that's the first dip into that.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   I don't know, man.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.480]   I think a lot of catching up to deal with Google Docs.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.160]   Google Docs is getting new stuff all the time.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   It's not Chrome.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.400]   They're getting amazing new features.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.120]   Oh, no, it's just open an app store for the Google Docs, which is a good idea.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.440]   It means you're going to get great third party stuff to do.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.440]   It's fantastic.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.240]   You know, we use Google Docs through our show planning, through a lot of other things.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.560]   I do find that, like for instance, creating spreadsheets in Google Docs is painful.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:20.000]   So I build them in numbers and then export them to Google Docs.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.320]   And I find that making things look pretty in Google Docs is pretty painful.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.320]   So I do that one.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.240]   I have one shake and bake style sheet.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.040]   I drop in and it looks great.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040]   Oh, send that.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.040]   You should post that or something.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040]   Oh, you know what?
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.040]   I'll put it up with a check in.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.680]   Put it up with a call for grip or somewhere.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.480]   Yeah, I'll put it up as a gist right now.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.480]   That was great.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480]   I've just got a chicken.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.600]   If it's a shake and bake template, I want a chicken.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.400]   Merlin, man, your pick of the week saw.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.520]   Yeah, because the reason I'm typing here, like a big jerk is I wanted to put up some
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.760]   images because I'm tired of trying to explain things on the iPhone without being able to
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760]   show it.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:49.760]   So once again, I'm sorry.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.760]   I don't mean this is a pimp.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.240]   It's a pretty good, good, good, good.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.240]   I'm not sure if I'm going to put that on a phone.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   I'm going to have a phone.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.720]   I'll have an email like streaming service, for example, a while back.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.760]   I had used it on, I think not on my Apple TV.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.920]   I used it on my Mac Mini as part of I want to say Boxy.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.920]   I cancelled Netflix a long time ago.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.560]   It was just too much of a hassle.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.100]   I think what I said on Twitter, I said something like, you know, it's like every movie that
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.560]   makes me want to cancel my cable is what you get streaming.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.920]   Not true anymore.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.480]   Oh, not true.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.600]   Not true anymore.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:49.120]   What you get now, two things that I love is first of all, it's my third Tivo, but it's
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.120]   the first one where I could have network capabilities.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.000]   Direct TV, direct Tivo wouldn't do that.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.800]   Now I've got the ability to program remotely and do things with Netflix.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.400]   Well, ITV is an iPhone app that lets you do both from your iPhone.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.760]   Essentially, if you see those screen grabs, you get an idea of what mine looks like.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.400]   You can go in and search and basically look at TV shows, look at movies.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.200]   Then when you see something you like, you click on it and you'll see right there that
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.680]   one, look at that screen.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:22.000]   If it's available on Netflix or it's available on TV, you just hit record and it sends it
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.600]   to your box or adds it to your watch instantly pile on Netflix.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.000]   So it's an interface to the Tivo.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.320]   It's an interface to Tivo and Netflix.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.160]   Yeah, you put in your credentials and basically you can do it all from here.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.840]   I think you can change your queue around.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.680]   I have a couple of apps I've been using, so I might be getting it wrong.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.520]   So it won't just be nice on the iPad?
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.520]   But I love Judge Judy.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.480]   Sometimes I'm just like, hey, so I can dive right in.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   You can have favorites.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.960]   And you'll see, I don't know if I uploaded this one, you can also pair it with your Tivo
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.960]   and use it as a remote.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.960]   I don't think that photo made it.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.960]   It says remote.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:52.960]   I see the remote, yeah.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:53.960]   Exactly.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.000]   So basically, it's kind of kind of fugly, but you can use this as a remote, which is
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.080]   pretty handy.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.080]   So imagine this app.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.640]   I mean, one of the reasons I want an iPad, to be honest, like a lot of first world idiots
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.680]   is to have it in the living room, you know?
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:12.600]   Have it be a device that we use kind of around the house and it's kind of big and unwieldy
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:16.480]   for a remote, but it'll be really handy to have this be so many different kinds of things.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.320]   I could be in a different room and basically, you know, pause or whatever.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.880]   Now you make me want to buy a Tivo.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.680]   Do you have to have a Tivo to make this worthwhile?
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.960]   Yeah, Weak Knees is the place.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960]   Weak Knees is amazing.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.960]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of theirs.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.800]   They actually helped me write my Tivo book.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   That's awesome.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.560]   Weak Knees is great because if you call them, they will walk you through whatever you need
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   to know.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.360]   Basically, it's a company that just sells direct Tivo's, Tivo DVRs and stuff, everything
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:41.920]   related to them.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.560]   But how do you have cable?
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.200]   How do you interface it?
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.200]   Don't get me started, Leo.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.200]   You don't use that.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.200]   You don't have to.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200]   It's not getting into too much.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.440]   I spent the last two years of my life getting really good at not needing a Tivo.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.440]   Let's leave it at that.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.440]   But my lady wanted that.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.440]   So, yeah, we have a cable.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.360]   We have a pretty basic cable.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.040]   And unfortunately, a direct Tivo will not work with cable unless you do some really
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.240]   heroic measures.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.200]   So basically, you just pop this into the back, HDMI out and you're good to go.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:13.200]   It's a 1080p.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200]   You don't care.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   Why am I telling you this?
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.200]   No, I do care.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   I asked you.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   I want to get a Tivo.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.240]   But I'm trying to figure out how I hook it up.
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.520]   It arrives and it took me the amount of time.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.520]   What is it?
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.520]   Ira Blaster?
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.200]   Or you just hook it up to your cable box?
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.720]   So you do coax in and then you pop in ethernet and ethernet cable and it goes right into
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.720]   my Mac Mini.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.400]   And I can pull shows off onto the Mac Mini.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.120]   I can program locally.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.960]   Which one did you get?
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.960]   I don't like that.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.200]   I want to get exactly what you got.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.600]   Okay, I got the one that's, I don't know how many hours HD.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.880]   You can get that new Premiere one.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.880]   I wouldn't get that.
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.360]   I would go with the XL.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:57.080]   I would go with the ones that were just discontinued with offer because you're Leo.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.760]   No, the one I liked is...
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.200]   Don't worry because as soon as I buy it, it will be discontinued.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.720]   So it doesn't, I don't have to get anything that's just...
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.320]   I would, the one I, you know, your mileage may vary.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.200]   I did not get the one with the THX option because I just have a crappy stereo.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200]   I'm sorry, 1080i.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200]   I apologize.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.200]   I didn't get that wrong.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.200]   So I got a series three Tivo HD.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.160]   And then you're just ordered by how much drive space you need.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160]   Tivo HD.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.160]   She can get one for 250 bucks.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160]   Wow.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.400]   Oh, and check it out.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.000]   Also it's got a USB out that works.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.080]   Are you using cable card on it?
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.520]   I'm going to need that to upgrade to some HD stations.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.440]   Yeah, see this is what I'm a little concerned about.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.920]   It's in your face to the cable box.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.720]   It's a Comcast and go get it with all respect.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.600]   And you go and get a card and you're good to go.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.200]   Don't give you a cable card if you...
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   Set up is a breeze.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   It's a Tivo.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.200]   It's too big, please.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.680]   And like, no, you don't have to use a Comcast DVR.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.760]   My God, that thing is like needles in your eyes.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:50.760]   It is.
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.760]   It's horrible.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.760]   That's what I've been using.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760]   It's horrible.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.400]   But to be honest, the menu, oh, and Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo, I didn't tell you.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   Yes.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:58.480]   I was looking like a nerd.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.320]   I went through every conceivable menu.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.200]   There's a video version of this show.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.200]   Did you know that?
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]   Yeah, I didn't know that.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200]   Because we make it.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200]   Okay.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.200]   That just actually just got on his camera.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.600]   I can watch this on your Kiva.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.440]   You can watch the show on your Kiva.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.440]   It's right there.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440]   It's a podcast.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.440]   Tech TV is actually...
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440]   Twit is featured on your...
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:18.440]   Yes, we are.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.680]   And we are putting all of our shows eventually to be video, but this is one of the first.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.240]   You can go listen to audio podcasts.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.080]   You throw a URL at it and you can listen to that.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.400]   You look nice today podcast.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.400]   It's all...
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.200]   If you guys would just...
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.880]   If you guys would just let me do video of you making the show, you could be on Tivo
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.880]   too.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.840]   Just get a loop of Scott and me drinking and then Adam editing.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:44.720]   I wish to God that you would please just let me just be the behind the scenes version
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   of you look nice today.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.720]   Just come up here.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.720]   We should have a...
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   We should have a...
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:50.720]   It would be great.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   No, no, no.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   I just...
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   We'll put cameras on you guys.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   It won't be the edited version, but it'll be on Tivo.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.200]   Well, I'm just sitting there pants.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.920]   I was eating Chinese food and drinking wine while I talk about poop.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.920]   I mean, I don't know if that's compelling.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.760]   It'll be a huge, huge, huge, huge...
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]   Okay.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   It's the funniest podcast on the internet today.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:07.240]   Like Judy Garland narrating her on a biography.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.240]   Exactly.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.240]   I was not afraid of something.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.240]   I was just a knelt boy.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.240]   It's a...
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.400]   Like a horse and a GM.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.920]   Like a rented mule they worked me night after night.
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.280]   So we might have confused you, but Merlin's pick was this.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.960]   It's a iPhone app called i.tv.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:24.960]   It's free.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.960]   It's free.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.760]   People peed and moaned about previous versions being better.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.280]   I have not had the problems that all the one star losers are reporting.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.120]   It's working fine for me.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.960]   Sarah, the previous version was bound.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.960]   I love this one.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   This one.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960]   Chris, I hate it.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.960]   You have to buy anything you want to watch.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.960]   I guess I should have read the description.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   That's my favorite.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.040]   And it was our freaky man.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:53.800]   I thought this would make iced tea because I should have read the description.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   One star.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:01.600]   There are a number of people who are at South by Southwest who are doing alternates to the
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.720]   rating system on iTunes because it's so crappy.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.840]   You cannot judge it in an app by the ratings, unfortunately.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.200]   I said that's all along.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.760]   I said that no matter where you go, first of all, I love that Amazon shows you what other
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.000]   people have voted as good reviews.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.920]   But if you want to learn the fact, if you only have a second or only want to take a second,
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.880]   go read the most highly rated two star review.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.000]   And that is where you learn about a product because two or three star reviews are generally
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.640]   the most thoughtful reviews because it's not somebody who's grinding an axe generally.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.240]   And it's somebody who usually has a not always but a more nuanced reason than fail.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   Right.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.040]   So you just take the top and bottom off, basically.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.560]   The ones in the fives you eliminate.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.240]   I wish I could throw out those outliers.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.040]   I wish you could build your own algorithm for sites like that.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.400]   This is where closed does not work as well, unfortunately, as open.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.080]   Oh, yeah, we need an API to the Apple recommendations.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.680]   Wait, how long do we have to wait for that?
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.840]   Oh, never.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:58.840]   Never.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.840]   Never.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.400]   Oh, never.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   So let's see.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.400]   I've done a pick.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   You've done a pick.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   You've done a pick.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   It must be Andy's turn.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400]   Indeed it is.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.480]   My pick is something I've been using for the past month, month and a half, I think, for
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.200]   this podcast and just everything else I've been recording.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:19.960]   Blue microphones has come out with the new blue Yeti microphone, which looks like some
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:20.960]   sort of brush.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.360]   It's cool because it looks like some sort of broadcasting award.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.480]   Merlin, I think you've made a mistake there.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.320]   A Wookiee and a Yeti are two different things.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.320]   I wasn't mean.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320]   I was mean.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.320]   I was mean.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   What was me?
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   I Wookieed.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.320]   You Wookieed instead of Yeti.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.320]   What does a Yeti sound like?
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.320]   Well, it sounds a lot like this.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:41.480]   I was kind of present to the microphone.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:47.640]   So I like, see, I don't have the same sort of microphone needs as real recorders and
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.320]   real broadcasters.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:53.760]   Traditionally, Mike has been this cool like M audio, USB, Mike.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.000]   That's done very, very well for me.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.680]   A lot of people say that it sounds really, really cool.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.680]   But I like this.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:04.040]   I like this Yeti mic because it has multiple features, multiple modes among them.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.960]   I'm going to show off the first one.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:09.080]   Like, I don't know how well I'm coming across right now.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.240]   Probably not very well, I'm guessing.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.680]   No, not very well.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.520]   Well, that's okay because this microphone has multiple modes.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:16.880]   It has multiple capsules.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:19.840]   So right now I have it in like regular like podcasting mode.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.960]   But if I'm interviewing someone, I can put it into this mode right here in which there
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960]   are capsules.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:29.240]   There's basically a two way conversation, two way direction.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:32.760]   I can also if I'm like, just want to set this up in a room for conference call or set
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:35.800]   this up in a room where lots of people are talking and performing, I can also put it
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:41.600]   in click, click, put it in omnidirectional mode so that no matter which way I face it,
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.440]   it's actually picking up audio.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.240]   So like it's I normally I'm normally using this in the same normal, you know, basically
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.640]   front facing podcasting on the on the desk out of the way the camera mode like this and
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.200]   it picks up really great audio.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.760]   But it also means that on those times when I'm at like a relatives house, I'm trying
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   to get them to tell like family stories or whether I'm interviewing somebody and I want
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.880]   to make it a good enough recording that I can use it on a podcast.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.800]   It has these extra extra modes to it.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:12.160]   I also like the fact that it has controls directly on the microphone for, you know, for
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.880]   things like gain so I can pretty much make adjustments like this without, you know, to
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.560]   adjust how sensitive or how non sensitive this thing is going to be without having to
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560]   go.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.280]   Yeah, I mean, you we can hear the differences as you as you twiddle.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.280]   Right.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.440]   And so normally you'd have to go into like the app settings to adjust this adjust that
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.320]   whereas I can just simply say, okay, just better like this, better like this, better
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.320]   like this, stop.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.320]   Okay, good.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320]   I'll stop right there.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.080]   And it has the other cool things like a put it back into there you go.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:48.040]   I just convenience features for idiot users like me like it has.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.680]   He just pushed a button and now you can't hear him.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.680]   But impressed.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680]   You won't be able to hear as thing at all.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680]   And it's actually lips.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.000]   You can actually see when this is flashing, you know that, okay, it is okay to cough or
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.160]   sneeze.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.160]   And then the volume volume control of your headphones is right up here.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.640]   And of course it also has its own dedicated headphone jack, which is really, really cool
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.040]   thing to have if you're doing like lots of podcasts.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:15.440]   It's kind of a must really because you hear your voice live and so delayed by like one
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.760]   quarter a second and that way you do not go insane.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.760]   So I've been it's actually been sort of encouraging me to, you know, do more auto recording like
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.720]   through this beautiful instrument.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.680]   I keep Nick, I keep near the desk because it really does give you that I think it's
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.160]   a nice balance between wanting to have the best quality audio you can possibly get without
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:41.040]   having to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment and stands and mixing boards and stuff like
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040]   that.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.040]   I'm really, really happy with it.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.040]   It's not terribly expensive.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:45.280]   It's about 150 bucks.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.280]   I think for a lot of families, this is a really cool investment because I honestly think that
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:56.280]   a decent microphone is almost more valuable than having a camcorder because it's really,
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.720]   really hard to get family to really open up in front of a camera because they know that
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.160]   their hair looks awful and they, you know, they feel as though they're too heavy or they,
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.560]   you know, they feel they're pasty.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.560]   Their hair is not done.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:12.200]   But if you simply drop by, I announced, I announced with your notebook and saying,
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.960]   gee, you know, I just, I didn't really, I remember there's a story about grandma that
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.160]   I keep hearing bits and pieces of.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   I was wondering if he, you know, he, he tells me like full stories so I could like share
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.160]   it with the grandkids.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.320]   And then he show up with this and it's a really nice high quality microphone.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.920]   And that's a really good piece of documentation that you'll have like for years and years
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:28.920]   and years.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.520]   And it's a story you would not get if you had to, someone had to see how messy the, the
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.520]   living room was.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   It's a really good idea.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   I really like that.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.560]   It's, it's, it's, it's actually, I, I haven't sort of seen it as a family purchase.
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.480]   The only bad thing I don't like, the only thing I don't like about it is that it does
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.360]   have a microphone mount, like a standard screw mount here in the bottom here.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.240]   But man, even if you take this out of this very, very solid base, it comes with, that's
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]   a big heavy microphone.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.240]   I'm not big.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.240]   It's really big.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.920]   But I think I'm going to, so I think I'm going to have to buy like a new microphone
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]   stand.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   I like this arm stand that I've been using so that, you know, I can, I still have access
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.240]   to my desktop and I could push it out of the way.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.920]   So, so for the past month and a half, every time I've had a record, something I've sort
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.760]   of had R2D2 again right here in my desktop.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.320]   But again, I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.280]   I think it's a really great mic.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.760]   It's, it's no must, no fuss.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.480]   I've had people recommend real audio people recommend certain mics to me and they tell
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.760]   me, well, you got to make sure that you surround it with this and get this sort of baffle.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.120]   Make sure you run it through this compressor.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.080]   It's really, you, you never believe this is only $130 microphone because if you add this
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.000]   $20 thing, this $80 thing and make sure you're acoustically blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.920]   You know, this is take out of the box, put it here, plug something in here, plug something
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.400]   in there, start recording it.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400]   You're good.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400]   Thank you for the pick.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.800]   Then Yeti from Blue Mike.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800]   Great price.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.800]   Yeti.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.800]   How much?
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800]   I think it's $149 or $129.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.800]   Wow.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800]   That's really good.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800]   That's so good.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800]   That's less price.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.800]   You can get it.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.800]   It's not discounted very much, but that's list.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.800]   That's the most.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.800]   So that's now going to be the recommendation set of the road podcaster for the best $150
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800]   USB mind.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800]   For $150.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.800]   But that's pretty cool.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.000]   And when they count with a snowball, this was years ago.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]   Not good.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.920]   We actually talked about it on an early Mac break and then we learned to hate it because
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.800]   it would distort all the time.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.040]   And they've obviously gotten a lot better.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.320]   They've learned a lot over the last couple of years.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   I might company would figure.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320]   It's interesting.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320]   This is like the blue.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.400]   Probably is very related to the blue.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.720]   It has the multiple capsules to give you multiple different patterns and so forth.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.720]   Great.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.720]   Looks like a great mic.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.600]   I just bought one for Daisy now.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.560]   You know, you should ask me because not only has Andy been using it for a while, but
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.640]   so has Randall Schwartz and Floss Weekly and both of them had been getting very good results
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:35.640]   with it.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.640]   I think it's a really nice one.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   I'm going to get another one.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.960]   Hey, one more story just before we wrap this up and this just came out from Google.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.880]   Thanks to the chat room for learning me to it.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.680]   Google, this is another shot across Apple's bow is now making a Nexus one that works with
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.480]   the AT&T 3G network.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:53.040]   So when you go to buy a Nexus one from Google, you'll get to choose whether you want it to
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.800]   work on T-Mobile's network or take your SIM card out of your iPhone and put it into the
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.120]   Nexus one and have it work on the AT&T network with full 3G.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.880]   I don't need to be mean, but if I didn't, if I wasn't using an iPhone, I just, I wouldn't
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.880]   consider AT&T.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.560]   That's kind of like the, the hugest advantage of the Nexus one is that you don't have to
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.560]   use AT&T on it.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:20.240]   When I was at South by Southwest, I have to say, I brought all three phones.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.320]   I brought up a Ryzen phone and AT&T phone and a T-Mobile phone.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.320]   Right.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:26.320]   Knowing that some of the networks wouldn't work.
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.160]   In fact, remember last year that AT&T just failed miserably at South by Southwest.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.120]   They put trucks in, they put towers out.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.760]   AT&T worked great in Austin this week.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]   It was really interesting.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.320]   They, they, they, they, they, they, they'll take a little time next week.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.280]   But don't, don't, I hate it when mommy and daddy fight.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   I know.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   Don't you feel that?
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.280]   They're supposed to just love each other.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.280]   Come on, Google.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   Come on, Apple, please don't get a divorce.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:50.840]   What about us kids?
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.280]   I'm like, and they're, they already had an affair.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.280]   It's over.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:00.640]   They, Google, I, I, I know that you feel so you're putting bread on the table, but you
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.000]   know that I will want to live with Apple.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.680]   You know that it won't even be a weekend and holidays thing.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.840]   You know that I'll want to live with Apple.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.400]   Back to that interview.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   Okay.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.680]   You, I've got, I've got Bing now.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.920]   Bing works perfectly well.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.760]   Their map features even better than yours.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:17.560]   I can live a Google free existence just fine.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.960]   To be perfectly fair, I think probably the 3G upgrade was so that they could work in
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.560]   Canada on the Rogers networks.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.560]   That was really the.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.920]   But it's just a side effect.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:26.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.320]   And by the way, and by the way, I mean, it's also above.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.360]   I mean, I maybe I'm just missing something really obvious, but it also makes it easy if
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.360]   you wanted to change from your iPhone to a nexus.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.520]   You don't have to change carriers.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.160]   That's exactly why they're doing this.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.560]   You could pop the sim out of your.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.560]   That's the soul.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:42.560]   That's the yeah, right.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:43.560]   Well, actually, I don't know.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.360]   Can you pop the sim out of an iPhone and put it in a nexus?
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360]   One is a standard sim.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.360]   I think it is.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.360]   I think it is.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.360]   It's only got one button.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.760]   That's the one button, Sim.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:57.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we've gone way over our allotted time.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:00.600]   You've invited us into your home and we just won't leave.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.600]   But now we're done.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:10.360]   We're going to find a look at the tote, please.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.720]   We just want $1 more than last year.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:17.040]   When you walk through a stroll, I'll go ahead.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.440]   I'm afraid of the dog.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.440]   Be afraid of the dog.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:29.840]   Can I just to say one thing, ladies and gentlemen, just one other thing besides happy birthday, Jerry.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:39.360]   Walk on with hope in your heart.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:44.560]   And you'll never, never, I'm watching, Jerry.
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:59.840]   Take it off.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:05.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey is the host of PixelCore.com, the great website for 3D
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.400]   artists who are learning and working together and pixxcore.tv for the podcasts.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.400]   Lots of those.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.960]   Look for the NAB coverage coming next month.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.640]   We have a new podcast that I don't know if we've talked about much.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:19.280]   If anyone's using Moto, it's a 3D package.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.160]   We have one called MotoShop, which we just started.
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.160]   So you can check it out.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.160]   MotoShop.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.000]   It's a 3D model, and it's starting off really well.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.560]   We're going to have a lot more visual effects and 3D podcasts that are coming out and that
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.120]   are specific to the applications that we use inside the pixxcore.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:38.360]   Also to Mr. Moylin-Man, we thank you for your participation.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.840]   Merlin is the host at 43folders.com.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.720]   I have two things to pimp.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.400]   First of all, and not even my pimp, you should read what John Gruber wrote yesterday about
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.400]   backup.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.400]   I have a post about it.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.200]   You do have a post about it, yeah.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.320]   Daring Fireball and NetGreat post about backup.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.800]   I had a couple of suggestions to that, but it's something we...
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:01.280]   This is going to be my muscular dystrophy.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.000]   Everybody needs to back up.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.160]   And that's why this...
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.160]   Boy, anyway.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:09.680]   The other thing is my friend Dan Benjamin interviewed me for his excellent podcast, The
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.240]   Pipeline.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.840]   And I hope you guys will listen to that.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.920]   I hope you will in general go listen to Dan Benjamin's podcast.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.920]   It's a 5x5.tv.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:21.040]   I want to get the address right.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.040]   But Dan is doing...
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:25.520]   He's doing his own kind of podcast, but kind of long inspired by people like you, Leo.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:29.240]   He's going out and he's doing his own thing, and he's doing a heck of a job with it.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.360]   So go listen to the pipeline.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.760]   You're plugging other people.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.560]   Well, I love and I give.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.640]   And the thing is if you're a person in this industry and you have a heart, they will grind
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.640]   you down.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.960]   And by the way, he's using those wonderful pictures of you.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.960]   I love that photo.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.280]   I love that photo so much.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.400]   HiveLogic.com for the Moylin man interview.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.680]   It's so crazy.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.960]   You just look crazy.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.960]   Absolutely insane.
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:59.240]   That guy took photos for two hours for a feature in 7x7 magazine here in San Francisco.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.520]   And that guy took pictures for two hours and found I was like, "You know, I have an idea.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.320]   What am I staying on a chair in the middle of the woods and you take a picture of me?"
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.720]   And he's like, "Are you serious?"
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.080]   It's the best picture ever.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.840]   Andy Inaco is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.840]   Look for his great writing there.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   And of course on his own website, celestialwasteofbenwitsiwob.com.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.080]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:23.480]   And you will tell us when you get an iPad, will you not?
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:30.320]   I will tell you everything as far as you are willing to believe what I say.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.240]   God, boy.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.240]   I'm telling you.
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.240]   God, boy.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.240]   It's the future.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240]   It's respectable.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.040]   All right, everybody, get back to work.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:39.800]   Break time.
