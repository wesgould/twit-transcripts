[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We got the whole team in town. It's awesome. Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.240]   Andy Inaco, Jason Snell, of course, new versions of Mac OS Ventura and iOS 16 raised the question,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.000]   when are we going to see new Mac and Tasha's? We'll talk about that.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.600]   Somehow Elon Musk snakes his way into the conversation. We'll talk about that.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.400]   And why did they fire the Bellevinator? The truth comes out. It's all coming up next.

[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.080]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the latest news from Apple. It's in the queue. Let's pop the stack.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.920]   I thought I'd throw in some developer talk.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:03.680]   Mr. Why not? I just can say, Snell, Lindsay and I co. They're all here.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.600]   Yo, yo, yo. Okay. Now you may speak. We've been talking for half an hour before anyway.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.560]   We're all used to each other now.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.040]   Hope I hope a response from Fidelity. I'm here setting my break points.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.920]   Oh, whoa. A little debugging session in Mr. Anatko's house.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680]   How about some pair of programming?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.000]   I was thinking maybe we should comment that out.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.960]   Comment that out. Oh, man.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.880]   You know, an email is just meta semicolon in the whole paragraph.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.160]   She bangs slash E was our slash then slash Python three.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   You're the programmer in the bunch, Jason. You're the one who keeps coming up with shortcuts and
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   do hickies and all that stuff. I give you four, five hundred. That's all I'm saying.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.280]   Shall I bubble sort or heap sort on this? Let me go get Donald News and figure it out.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   The EU will require USB C charging for mobile devices by the end of next year.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.280]   We did it, everybody. We did it. We did it. We did it.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.720]   So what is Apple going to do? Are they going to? So by the way, if it won't affect the iPhone 15,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.360]   because anything sold before the end of 2024 is not impacted. So it really means that
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.680]   iPhone 16 probably, right? Can I just say that if Apple has not ditched the lightning port by then,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:36.000]   they're just trying to be jerks. So I've got my loner like 14 Pro and the only thing that I
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.840]   hate about it, I like so much about is this damn lightning port because as I'm spending the first
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520]   few days setting up, oh, that's easy. I'll just get. I'll just get this thumb. Oh, no, I don't have
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.440]   a thumb drive. Well, what if I just hook it up to? Oh, no, I can't hook it up to this. Well,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.600]   gee, oh, the power. So I'll just hook it up to these. Oh, no, I can't hook it up to that either.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   I'm going to have to basically have a lightning station to deal with the over these the alternative
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.320]   reality that Apple has in which basically people still think that lightning is a thing. They're
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.000]   the first to get rid of the headphone jack because oh, nobody uses the headphone jack, but oh, yeah,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.240]   we'll keep the lightning. Oh, everybody loves everybody loves the we're getting both. Like
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.920]   Jason, what is it they will always say they would say in the six seconds. We are customers love
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.480]   our lightning port. Our customers love the lightning port and what they'll say next year is, but you
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.560]   know what? We decided to do something better. Although I gotta be we gotta be fair here.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.720]   They got so much crap from everybody when they went away from the dock connector to the lightning
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.680]   connector. And I'm sure there are people that are like, oh, man, this is going to happen again.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   But yeah, the time has passed. I actually the rumors I think Leo are that next year, at least one,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.440]   and maybe all the iPhones will finally go USB C. Apple's known this is coming for a while. And
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.000]   besides, which Andy's totally right. The only way you'd keep the lightning port at this point is
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.280]   spite. Like that's literally it's moved on. The lightning port was a good idea. It allowed Apple
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   to get out there with it before USB C was finalized, good for them. But USB C is everywhere even on
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.400]   the Apple product line. It's everywhere but the iPhone now and and some charging on peripherals,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.360]   right? And all that stuff's going to flip over in the next couple of years, for sure.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   And this is the quote from the EU, the European Parliament voted to make this standard. Regardless
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.880]   of their manufacturer, it doesn't matter. They actually they actually mentioned that. Regardless
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.640]   of the manufacturer, all new mobile phone anything with 100 watts or down. So if it's more than
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.760]   100 watts power delivery, like a laptop, you got till 2026. But all new mobile phones,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.840]   tablets, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld video game consoles and portable speakers,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.200]   e-readers, keyboards, mice, portable navigation systems, earbuds, and laptops that are chargeable
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.040]   wire, wired cable, operating the power delivery up to 100 watts will have to be equipped with a
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   USB type C port. By the way, you can't throw a charger or an adapter in the box. It's got to have
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   that port laptop. All of Apple's peripherals are going to have to be redesigned because the
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.280]   mass head and the magic mouse and the magic keyboard all charge with lightning. So they're
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.360]   going to have to change all of those to and even the brand new AirPods Pro case is lightning port
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.840]   on there. Well, that's a good I mean, do you think consumers will be miffed? Andy, did you say
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:35.600]   G-host of fat or Chi-host of fat, which is a wireless fan? I do wonder what their strategy is going to
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   be. I mean, I think USB-C is just so obvious that they'll do it and it's not going to be that big a
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.200]   deal and people will complain and they'll be adapters and it'll be fine because the world is ready
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.560]   in many ways. The difference between this and the dock connector to lightning transition is that
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.440]   the world was not ready for lightning because there was no nobody was paving the way. The world
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.360]   is ready for USB-C devices now. It really is. The world is here. Yeah. It's easy to
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   legislate the past because they're going to USB-C anyway. I don't think they changed the
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.720]   directory. Apple did claim in 2020, you may remember 2020, that the charger requirement was
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:29.440]   stifle innovation. Three years ago. This is the fun thing about Apple statements. It's always like,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.280]   this is courage. We're here to innovate and we're here to give you the
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000]   we're going to skate to where the puck is going to be unless it's like for whatever bizarre reason
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   again. It's like, yeah, we're going to have a mobile, we're going to put it on the AirPods Pro.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.800]   Why would you even do that? It's just such a silly thing. It's like,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.760]   the question is, is it, does it, do they have to put it in even if it was wireless charged?
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.200]   Like even if it doesn't need, oh, does it have to have a port? Yeah, I don't believe so when I
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.360]   I'm sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to. I have a feeling that the direction for some of the
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.000]   products will just be to get rid of the port altogether. Yeah, especially, especially. You can't
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.400]   put in. You can't put a USB C into a watch. Oh, no, no, no, they really are. So what I'm saying is,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   is that so I can see the AirPods and a lot of the other things and even the lower end iPhones
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.960]   just not having to port at all. You know, like in any of the pro ones need it because they need
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.680]   the speed. Yeah. It requires them to have a wireless charger in the box though, which is with the USB
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.480]   C. Yeah, exactly. But that would be fine. I don't think Apple thing is like, I think Apple could
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.240]   do it and then just give it a USB C to a wireless to whatever. And then what would they would do
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.520]   is probably just do it in Europe. Okay. They wouldn't have a separate skew for that.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.120]   Not that I don't think. And it's always an interesting conversation about what Apple,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.840]   Apple is the company that would say that there are so many compelling reasons both from us as a
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.240]   manufacturer who wants things to be simple and cheap to make. And for the consumer to simply say,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.400]   you know what, we're going to commit to make safe. We're going to have a connector with Pogo
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   pins on it's like contact pins for things that could absolutely require a mechanical connection.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.960]   But we don't see the reason for going with USB C when we can build something custom that is so
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.440]   much more added so much more agile for our needs. I don't think it would be a good idea. But
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   I would be interested in at least hearing the argument that Apple would make for it. Because if
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.280]   any one company is going to do it well, it would be Apple. What is what what about though the argument
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.400]   Apple, the three year old Apple argument, two year old Apple argument that stifles innovation?
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.600]   What if there's something better than USB C does it looks like Parliament would have to approve it?
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.880]   Yeah, it is. I would be much more troubled about this if I didn't feel like the era of
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.800]   relying on wired connections was rapidly ending and that USB C as a connector is robust enough to
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.000]   last a long time. But there is this question of like, what if they had legislated that everybody
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.120]   use USB A, right? I mean, and then you'd say, well, they would maybe work with the USB consortium
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.480]   to come up with a new standard and all that. And it is that part, I don't disagree with the fact
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.640]   that it means that nobody can come out there and invent a better plug because it won't be able to
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   be sold in Europe. At the same time, I think the realistic impact of this is pretty small because I
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.160]   have I have a hard time imagining that somebody's going to invent a truly better mouse trap at this
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.840]   point. That is a wired connection to a smartphone, right? It just doesn't I feel like USB C is good
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.920]   for a long time. And by the time that you it's not, we probably won't be using cables anymore.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   Yeah, I think that I think that the impact is probably for this one is minimal. The precedent
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.960]   is a little scary because you know, the people who write these laws are, you know, they're digital
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.600]   children led by children. Like there's nobody actually operate with operational knowledge,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.360]   making these decisions. And so they, you know, so that it just got this one, this one,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.160]   they have staff or somebody that's going to talk about.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   Staff are a bunch of kids. Like, you know, like, like, we see that's what it is in the United
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.600]   States. They're staff of kids that have never actually worked in the industry. They're all coming
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.200]   out of Harvard and they've gotten good degrees and they don't know they haven't actually worked in
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.600]   the industry most of the time. And so they're making a bunch of theoretical decisions with,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.360]   and they're telling people to make decisions who don't know anything about it. And so the thing is,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.880]   is that it's as a as the government tinkering with this, there's just a high probability of them
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.840]   doing a lot of damage. In this case, they're not going to impartially, they're not doing much
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   damage because they were stalled for so long. So they stopped, they were stalled out for so long
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.520]   to the point where it just doesn't matter anymore. But at some point, they'll start making decisions
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.080]   that do. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want any governmental agency to say, you know, to mandate
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.680]   e-cims, for instance, there's a, I think there's a strong societal case to, you know, try to eliminate
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   the waste of multiple chargers. And it certainly benefits consumers. I mean, are you happy that
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.280]   the days of like every good example is Brazil, Brazil is finding Apple for not putting the
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.680]   charger in those chargers or trash. Like the chargers that see that Apple sends out are underpowered,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.320]   oversized, like you know, and all of us have a bunch of them. I got a, I got a box full of these,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.480]   these things that have come from every device that came out. And you know, I don't use any of
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.240]   them anymore. I don't even use the ones that come with the laptops, you know, and so the, so the,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.200]   actually, is a brisk market, isn't there for GAN and I mean, USB C charger. Because then it does,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.000]   it's one, it's one brick that I can take on the road and I can just power all the different things.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.600]   Do you think normal people do that or just sophisticated people?
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.400]   I imagine it's doing quite well. A lot of normal people have, I,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.560]   yeah, but a lot of normal people have, have the, I mean, they already have ones laying around at
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.960]   this point. Yeah. No, so I can. Well, and it is annoying. I mean, I have to say it is annoying,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   and you've made this case before where you get the wrong kind of cable or the wrong kind of charger,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.560]   you know, and you have that little, what was it, the five watt Apple phone charger,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.720]   you plug it in and it doesn't work. I don't understand way and you're, that's annoying.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.120]   So I don't, you haven't let, they haven't legislated a fix for that.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.320]   Yeah. And on the positives,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.520]   on the positive side of things, I do, I, on the positive side of things, it's nice to,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.200]   to know that someone gets a charger that is certified, that is proper as opposed to, I went to the,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.600]   I went to the Bodega across across the street, got something that looks like an Apple charger,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.640]   but it actually set stuff on fire because, because it was, things were overheating or stuff like that.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.760]   And, and I do agree with a lot of the points that Alex is making be the counterpoint that I would
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   make is that I don't think that they're as, I never think that they are as ill, people are as ill
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.240]   advised as Alex has, has, has experienced. Number two, if there is, if the counterpoint to,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.600]   well, they don't have people who work in the industry who are advising on this,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.920]   well, that's good because this isn't here to help the industry. This is here to help consumers.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.520]   And we've all seen how we watered down a consumer or safety oriented legislation can be once,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.080]   oh, don't worry, we'll have the oil industry advise on how much, how much that should be
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.640]   budgeted for cleanup and what, what constitutes a leak. So it's, it's a good, it's sometimes it's
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.480]   a good thing to push things forward to have an adversarial relationship between the government
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.440]   and industry. If the result is something that's positive for consumers, it isn't, it isn't always,
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.200]   but this is why I don't necessarily think it's the fact that you don't have someone who's had 10
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.480]   years of experience in manufacturing or someone who just came from, who's basically spending a two
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.840]   or three years stint in government basically to make the contacts, to make themselves more employable
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   after this administration ends when they go right back into industry and they can say, oh, well,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.240]   don't worry, we can quash this. I know, I know, I know that so-and-so, like, actually doesn't read
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.080]   much when they're on Thursday because that's their golf date. If we just introduce this on
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.040]   Thursday, we'll have a much better chance of this going through. All right. Your word of the week,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:55.920]   this week is certioriari. Sertioriari? Sertioriari. What is certioriari? Sertioriari is when the,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.120]   the Supreme Court will, says it will take a case. Or not. You ask it to take this because they
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.720]   don't have to take any case. Right. People might think, I learned this myself, the Supreme Court,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.360]   you can appeal to the Supreme Court. You can. You can, but they can say no. You have no right
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.000]   of appeal to the US Supreme Court. They get to choose what case is and that's called certioriari.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.880]   Sertioriari. Yep. It is. I learned this in, I had to take a mediolaw class.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:35.200]   And so, and this was, we talked about petitioning and, you know, they take cases that they want to
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.160]   rule on, essentially, right? They want to either affirm the lower court ruling and say, yes, this
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   is settle law and settle it instead of it being kind of like, well, this one says this and this
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.440]   one says that, or they want to overturn it because they think it was a bad decision. And so they
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.960]   tactically, I think, I forget how many justices need to say yes to grant for. Is it? Yes. So not
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.040]   a majority just enough to be almost a majority to take the case. They have some weird rotating
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.440]   docket situation where the appeals come in, they get a stack of them. I'm sure that's a pretty big
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.480]   stack. And then they doll it out to the clerks because the judge justices don't even look at them.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.040]   They don't add to the clerks. The clerks write up whether they think it should be granted or not.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.760]   The justices look at them. It takes four justices. I think they rotate which justices have because
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   it's a big stack. And you don't want, you know, you got things to do places to go. You're a Supreme
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   Court justice. You got to get the robes. You don't want to. So, yeah, so let's take a turn. All that
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   and this is being October is when they date all the certior issues go out. And Apple has lost its
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.520]   certiorary, our certiorary. That's a long way to certiorary, I think. They've, they've, it's a
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.840]   and it's shortened usually to a writ of cert cert. I say certain that you know why they
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.200]   grant a writ. Yeah, they're looking for a grant. They're looking for the Supreme Court to grant a
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.480]   writ of cert. And the it's Latin. It's Latin. People love Latin. I was about to say I'm not
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.800]   regretting taking Latin as my elective foreign language course. I'm because boy, now I know how
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.080]   to pronounce things. I'm coming Apple. I took Latin. I took many years of Latin. I still don't know how
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.240]   to say. I think in Latin it would be territory. Are we?
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.880]   Characteriorary. The problem is not Latin. The problem is American.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:25.200]   Or whatever English you would almost say. Yeah, I can say it in Latin. The Supreme Court on Monday
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:34.320]   decided to not grant cert to Apple's bid to cancel three Qualcomm smartphone patents. There's
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.280]   actually a good reason for it. They've already settled in effect by saying, yeah, we'll pay you
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:46.240]   the license fees. Okay, fine Qualcomm. Apple, even though they've negotiated a settlement
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:56.160]   in 20, I think 2017 to pay the fee or 2019 billions of dollars in patent fees, they decided
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.040]   it'd be nice if we could just get the Supreme Court to overturn this patent. Just then we would,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.200]   you know, for future reference. patents were upheld. They appealed to the patent specialist,
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:14.240]   US Court of Appeals and the Federal Circuit, which said in a two to one ruling,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.960]   that's what's the legal term for. That's again, more Latin.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.720]   In this Mr. Case, last year for a lack of standing saying, well, you guys already settled this.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.000]   Yeah. Yeah. I don't understand why you bother us with this stuff. We got stuff to do here.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.800]   And the Supreme Court agreed. They will. Just be clear. And I know we just described it,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   but the key thing to so many news reports are like Supreme Court denies or whatever. And it's like,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.680]   that it really is very much like you throw it in the black hole and a small number of things
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.600]   come back out. And if yours doesn't come back out, that's just it. They just say pass. And there's
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.440]   no ruling one way or another. They don't want to touch it. They're just going to leave it where it
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.080]   is. It's a pass. Although, I will, we're joking about Latin. There was a, funnily enough, yesterday,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:06.880]   an amicus brief filed by the onion. Funnily enough. Yes. Trying to, trying to get
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.840]   a different case, obviously put into having it cert granted. And it is the most hilarious
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.320]   amicus. Very funny. It's very funny. And it spends a lot of time talking about how lawyers love
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.280]   Latin, which I thought was really great. And they, what do they call the Supreme Court?
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.120]   Oh, they had a funny name for them. The Latin, the Latin wonks, I think they call them.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.840]   Yeah. So this is actually an important case because it was about whether you could parody
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:44.800]   local police on Facebook. The police didn't like it. And eventually, they were
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:52.480]   told, they were counter sued by the guy who posted the thing. And eventually he was told,
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.960]   you know, qualified immunity protects us with the police against you. And that's what really,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.920]   this is about his qualified immunity. And the onion, which of course is a parody thing.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.200]   Simply the whole issue was, do you have to label it parody? And the onion says, no,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.480]   parody functions by tricking people into thinking it's real to stultist,
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.440]   est, you are dumb. Yep. These three Latin words have been the onions motto and guiding lights.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.560]   It was founded in 1988 to stultist s. That's a good, that's good to know. That's good to know.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.840]   That's some good Latin. Yeah. Yeah. The onion knows the federal judiciary staffed entirely by
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:41.280]   total Latin dorks. They quote, could tell us in the original Latin and chambers, they sweetly
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.840]   whisper, starry diseases into their spouse's ear. They mutter kui bono under their breath while
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:55.360]   picking up after the neighbor's dogs. It's because it's a legal document. This cost them $80,000.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.920]   Oh, but what worth it? You're going to be able to repenny. You're going to. Yeah, you're going.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.680]   I don't know. I think they may have paid the lawyer may have paid them to do it. It's like,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.760]   this is kind of the most fun brief that lawyer has ever put together. With that.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   It is. And it's a good, it makes very good arguments, but there are also lots of jokes.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.680]   It's very funny. Because it's the onion. But it really makes bags a question. Does the Supreme
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.520]   Court have a sense of humor? They may be Latin dorks.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.480]   There are moments in Supreme Court's rulings where they can make jokes, although it's probably
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.920]   their clerks making the jokes in the Supreme. They're like, forget about it. It's fine. Just put it in
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.120]   there. It's a footnote. People will love it. Let's just move on. But yeah, I think the problem here
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.520]   is that the Supreme Court probably won't take this case. And given the composition of the current
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.800]   Supreme Court, if they do take this case, they will probably take it so that they can say this is
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   not a First Amendment right? And the police can do what they want.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.320]   Right. Qualified immunity. Yep.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.880]   So yeah. In the, in the amicus brief, they mentioned the fact that in 2012, the onion
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:04.000]   proclaimed Kim Jong Un is the sexiest man alive. And that China's state run news agency republished
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.760]   the story is true alongside a slideshow of the dictator himself in all his glory.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   In fact, they have quite a few cases of clueless people picking up onion stories and
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.840]   long line of them. I mean, it's a long line. There's been so many examples where someone
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.200]   saw it go by and somehow it at someone usually what happens, they retweet it and
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.840]   someone in another country that doesn't know what the onion is. Right. The ghost goes haywire with it.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.320]   A reasonable reader does not need a disclaimer to know that parody is parody is the, is the basis
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:44.560]   of this brief that you shouldn't have to. There it is. Update. He is the sexiest man alive.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.920]   Look at those cheeks. Don't you want to just go, Oh, you do, you do, you do.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.880]   You know, if I, you know, their missiles aren't that great, but if I were on the west coast,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.680]   like the, the closer point, the good point, I wouldn't say, you know, good point, not really
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:06.160]   laughing at her in Japan these days. I agree. Sir, sir, chirari,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.480]   sir, chirari. Yeah. It's a long way to search her area. Actually, for Apple, it was, but no,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:20.000]   they, they gained nothing. Nice try. Apple, you know, Apple's got the money to pay their lawyers.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.680]   They're like, why not? This will save us billions of dollars if it works. So yeah, a few thousands
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.440]   to the lawyers. It's totally worth. I don't think they pay extra lawyers. Don't they just own those
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.840]   lawyers? Don't they have their own building? There's thousands? Yeah, that may be true. That may be true.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.080]   So it gives them some issues in a completely side note.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.800]   In the Elon Musk versus Twitter in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.680]   Goldman, you remember that we, we, and we talked about on Sunday, we're starting to see,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.160]   you know, direct messages between the parties that are quite embarrassing.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:01.120]   Goldman Sachs has been trying to get out of this. They sent 36 lawyers to argue their case
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:09.200]   against in the Delaware in the Court of Chancery. 36 lawyers arrive in court.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.920]   Unbelievable. Where do they sit? What are they doing?
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.800]   You have different specialists that are looking at different things. So you have your,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.720]   you have your main lawyers that are going to be trying the case. And usually that probably won't
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.200]   be a group larger than four or five. But then you have people that are, the case, a lot of times
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.960]   with financial cases are so complex, you have different people that have spent all their time
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.680]   focusing on one thing or another, their lawyers, and they understand what those things legally
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.840]   mean. And then they're basically pushing all that information back up to the lawyers that are
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.560]   actually asking the questions of going, you know, like, and so every break, every whatever,
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.320]   well, you got to take this angle or look at this, or this is an opening, or this is,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.400]   so having a lot of, I mean, it's not uncommon. It is uncommon. It's very uncommon to have that
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.680]   many lawyers, but it is not. I mean, a lot of times you may end up in a large case. I've worked
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.800]   on cases I used to do legal animation a long time ago, and for a very large law firm. And,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.240]   yeah, we had a lot of lawyers working on this. They could courtroom.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.920]   I could do that. And this is a, you need a lot of 55. I mean, the biggest case I ever worked on
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.080]   was like a $750 million case. And it was a lot of, it was a lot of, it was a lot of many lawyers.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.560]   I should make it. I think it's not, I'm sorry, I said the wrong bank. It's Morgan Stanley,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.080]   I believe. But it's, you know, it's, so there's a lot of money in state.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   So there's a lot of embarrassment at stake. I think it's mostly what it is, because Morgan Stanley
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.200]   said we're going to lend Elon the money and quickly, that quickly lost interest along with Elon.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   And they really, what they really, really, really don't want to have happen is for the judge to
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.240]   say, no, no, you're going to have to buy Twitter. Actually, I think if you like Twitter, you probably
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.360]   don't want to. I didn't quite understand why he now he says that he's going to do what changed
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.800]   in the deal that he said he was going to do the original deal. Like he's willing to do the original,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   he's now willing to buy them for the original offer. I think somebody must have come to him with a
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.320]   plan and money to say, we'll do this together. And we'll, we've got our plan for it. I wonder if he
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.840]   just got better backing from probably one of his billionaire friends to sort of say, yeah, I'll go
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.040]   in on this with you. Let's do it. You know, maybe Peter Thiel or somebody like that came in and said,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.200]   let's take it over. I don't know. Oh, you know, I could see that actually. I could see Peter Thiel
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   saying, you know, this would be a good thing if we could just control this. Also, the longer this
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.920]   holds in limbo, the worse things get for Twitter. It's the downside for Elon gets bad, but for
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.520]   Twitter, it gets much, much worse because that means what happens if you actually do want to sell,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.040]   what happens when you are trying to attract new investment, what would happen if you
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.560]   opened up that sort of if that Delaware trial actually went through, and now Twitter really
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.160]   does have to open up all the books and all their operational behind the scenes stuff,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.280]   they're both sides are very well motivated to find a way to basically settle this.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.960]   Yeah. And the problem is, if if if if Musk goes through a scorched earth attack on Twitter and then
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.600]   then has to buy it, it's like it's like it's like it's going to be loses. And then he's destroyed
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.240]   their reputation. It doesn't it's not good for his own investment. It's, you know, it's a lot of
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.920]   money. I mean, after a billion here, a billion here eventually that's up to real money. And
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.760]   well, not to mention that a lot of it's borrowed against a Tesla stock and he would probably have
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   to sell a lot of stock, which is going to hurt him in other ways and hurt certainly hurt Tesla.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:34.080]   It's just a mess. It's a mess. But it's going to be the trial of the century in about two weeks.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.960]   I'm excited or not. It sounds like they've decided they've gone up to it. But Apple's not
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.280]   involved in it at all. No, and that's another that's actually another reason why Musk might be
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.560]   motivated, right? Is that there's probably stuff that he doesn't want to come out the trial. Yeah,
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.600]   yeah, yeah. Well, certainly 36 lawyers don't want Morgan Stanley's stuff. So, yeah, you're you're
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:01.360]   more up on this than I am Alex. But but now I'm going to be following busted deal bought on Twitter
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:10.800]   because busted deal bought posts all of the documents from the docket as they come in.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.200]   And three hours ago, see, I didn't know this three hours ago, a new filing to the Honorable Kathleen
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   St. James McCormick from Edward B. Micheletti Esquire regarding defendant's motion. So, yeah,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.800]   so he wants to so he says, what, I'll buy it. Oh, this is this this is this is this is
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.200]   his whistleblower stuff. So he wants to buy it for the original price. That's crazy.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.880]   Buy it for the original offer. There must be something different between the original offer and
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.760]   the offer that I don't know what the details were there. He is more changeable than the weather,
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.720]   isn't he? Good. Oh, Elon. He's done. Okay. Thank God. He's stringed the part of
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.280]   on Ukraine to go. Oh, yeah. And his piece. Oh, yeah. Right. He's really really
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.160]   really what he's talking about. I trust really galaxy brain. This is this is galaxy brain is
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.160]   the name of by the way of the great. Is it Charlie Watson's or Charlie? War cell. Yeah. Yeah. Is it
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:10.480]   war cell or searcher? Or anyway, war is war zolly? I don't know. You say it because it's funny.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.800]   You know, he's a billionaire and he has this toss toss off like well, I've been successful with
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.000]   all this other stuff that I've done. Oh, billionaires do this. It's crazy.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I fix this and the answer is, oh, you just get together and you work on it and all that.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.280]   And everybody who knows about international relations is like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.880]   Don't do that. This is like what? I like Ukraine. I just think that they should solve this.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.360]   This is how you get elected president. You know, you just, you know, just have that kind of,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.720]   you know, I could just just get together and talk. We just do a good idea. Yeah.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:42.240]   That's what I do. Well, that's that's a demo of a fundamental problem with the Steve Jobs
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.200]   of vacation of like the CEO seat where I thank you for bringing it back to Apple. Andy and I go
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:57.760]   ladies. Hey, Bravo. I am a communications professional. But yeah, it's like the presumption that
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.280]   of all the wonderful discussions that we and everybody else has about Steve Jobs,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   he has he knew to stay in his lane. He knew like the fact that I'm the fact that I'm the CEO of
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.560]   Apple, the fact that I have that yes, I'm responsible for much of the success this company does not mean
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:22.400]   that I am a genius futurist who is just I isn't it a shame that I'm restricted my God given insight
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.440]   into the world to just technology. And that's why I'm going to start backing political parties
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.680]   and political movements. And it's not even not just that, but even technologies where it's like,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.640]   I know exactly how to how to change education in the world because I know that if we apply
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.480]   technology investment, I know how to change how to improve transportation. I know how to improve
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.320]   hunger. I know how to do the situation because I have this technological background and because
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.120]   I'm a genius head of a huge company, which is why you just say, no, but what specifically do you want
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.800]   to do? And then you say, well, he just fixed the problem. You just you you you imagine hear it.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.040]   We're reinventing things that were already invented. So it's great.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.960]   I mean, most most CEOs know to stay in their lane. Like most of them, most of them,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.680]   they're going to contribute. They could be quietly. It's not CEOs. It's it's it's it's
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.960]   billionaires that are the most billionaires. Exactly. Right. I think I think you look at any guy who's
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.840]   got is in the three comma club. They think they got there by merit. And most of the time,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.560]   right? It ain't the case. It's luck. It's a lot. It's a lot of what what happened with
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:34.880]   Aaronos. It wasn't just the it was a scam, but it was a scam that the bros who the the the
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.320]   little click of billionaires who got there because they are visionary insights. They know what the
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.920]   future is. They they adopted Aaronos into the club saying, Oh, no, no, you're just they're just
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.560]   like us. They're they're they're visioneers. There's their insight people as opposed to no,
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.400]   that still means you have to take a look at the numbers. You see, ask, ask, ask, ask,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.840]   ask, ask molecular chemists. Is it actually physically possible to take eight molecules of blood and
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.480]   then try to figure out what year date and place they're going to be hit by a bus accident that
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.040]   Elizabeth Holmes was a Steve Jobs fan. So there we go. It's full circle. Well, but I but I think that
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.880]   I think that there that these these some of the billionaires are pretty original as far as how
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.760]   they view it and we can decide whether what they did was good. But but we can but you know,
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.640]   Musk's understanding of how to a unified experience, a unified electrical, you know,
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.200]   dependence is something that is is a pretty interesting model that he's pushing forward. Now,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.400]   he does all this other stuff is a distraction that he doesn't need to do. Like, you know,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.720]   but he's does that. Well, Steve Jobs stayed in in the area of he did what he knew how to do well.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.400]   Yeah, to his credit, you know, he did not make pronouncements about peace in our time and
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.480]   things like that. He just stayed out of politics. He stayed out of charity, something Apple has
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.120]   changed. But he just didn't he didn't feel like he needed to throw his weight in on that stuff.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.240]   Right. That's the perplexing thing about Musk, right, is that there are so many
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.520]   things in the positive column for him and yet he can't help himself. I I'm a space fan and I
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.440]   used to do a podcast regularly about space and space exit. I talked to people who are like,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.760]   oh, that space exit's totally a scam, right? Because Elon Musk and I'm like, no, it's completely
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.480]   revolutionized access to space and lowered the cost and NASA can't launch a science mission right
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.880]   now on anything but a SpaceX rocket. It's the only game in town. And that's because they're so
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.120]   good and their cost structure is so good. But let's be clear. And yet he makes these pronouncements
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.200]   about, oh, but we're all going to live on Mars in two years. Like, dude, there's stop talking.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.360]   There is some evidence that it's just the SpaceX's success is despite Elon.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.960]   Oh, yeah. Well, the Gwyn shot. Well, I mean, the answer there is that they put an adult in charge
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.840]   of the company. Yeah. And that has helped a lot. But yet he still can't stop talking about it.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.080]   It's really remarkable. But this guy is so, I mean, we see this with a lot of billionaires where
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.440]   like some of it is about going outside of their domain. But I think and Steve Jobs often didn't do
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.400]   that, which was, which was a smart move. But, you know, sometimes they just can't help themselves,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.600]   right? There's nobody there to tell them not to do it. So they just keep doing it.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Let's take a break. We're going to come back. We have more Apple news.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.920]   That's our Elon Musk section.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.720]   Crazy. I think, you know, you told, you broke the story here, Alex. And I'm just kind of now reading
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.000]   up on this about him changing his mind. This is bizarre. This is just this is this. You couldn't
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.680]   write this in a, you know, this couldn't be a scene in succession, a plot point in succession,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.800]   because you think it was two nuts or maybe not. It's funny. No, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.920]   Yeah. It's it's it's it's it's like, I don't I just don't understand it yet. Like, I know what
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.320]   happened, but I'm like, I don't like what there's something. Well, it's not a dumb guy. There's
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.080]   some reason that he's doing this. And I don't understand what that is. A.B.C. who quotes it
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   analysts from Wedbush. It's because he thought he's he realized he was going to lose anyway.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.440]   Yeah. But but I get that. But but he's there. There's something that that they're fighting in
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.320]   court. And he's saying he wants to go back before that agreement. And I'm not sure what the
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.800]   difference is between the agreement that he's fighting and the agreement that he's offering.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.120]   He still wants to pay 5420, which is way over.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's not arguing about the money, but there's something else there that he's that he's trying
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.040]   to avoid. Like that's the like. So it's a right. It's discovery.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.000]   And I just don't understand. Well, no, no, but I but there's something else like otherwise he
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.280]   would just give up on the case. Like if he was going to give him what they asked for,
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.800]   right, surrender, yeah. But there's something else that he's trying he's asking for a new deal that
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.520]   is the old deal that isn't the current deal. And I don't know what the delta is between the old
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.560]   deal and the new deal. Like I don't, you know, that's the part that I don't understand.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.960]   Everyone always does that. There's always a, I think there's always a, when someone
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.800]   offers something that looks like it's the same, it's not, you know, like,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.920]   I just haven't figured out. I haven't had enough time because I only saw it this morning to figure
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.960]   out what the delta is between what they're arguing about and what he's offering.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.040]   It's possible Forbes got it wrong as well. I mean, it's, you know, it's in a couple different
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.200]   places. I saw I was bouncing around trying to dig through figuring out what it was. It's not.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.400]   I know Forbes got it wrong.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:59.680]   I think though it's Forbes story. So, I don't know. I mean,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:12.080]   it's fascinating. The market agree, you know, believes it because the Twitter's price went up
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.240]   a lot and then trading was halted. So the market believes this.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.160]   That's what I'm talking about. This kind of uncertainty absolutely is like throwing a company
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.640]   into acid. The quick, you get them out of sunlight, the quick and get out of acid better.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.920]   Oh, you're right. It's Bloomberg CNBC and the journal. Yeah. So, yeah, interesting.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.160]   We live in interesting times. Not necessarily a good thing. Just want to say exactly.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.640]   It is referred to as a Chinese curse. Yes.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.680]   They may use a really interesting, you live in interesting cars.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.920]   Our show today brought to you by a great company that I love, Hover. They're Canadians.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:58.960]   They're nice. They're also the place I register all my domain names. Hover is by far the best domain
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.720]   registrar out there. If you're a blogger, if you're creating a portfolio, if you're building an
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.920]   online store, maybe you just want to make a more memorable redirect to your resume on LinkedIn.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:14.720]   I don't know. If you're not doing Hover for email, you just go to hover.com, register your
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.520]   company's name or whatever your family name. I have a family name, email domain.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:30.880]   That's your email address forever, forever more. Email at your domain name is huge. It makes you
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:37.760]   look more professional if your business builds trust for your brand. It also is great for families.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.240]   Hover has domain-based emails for all your needs, small or large. It's very easy to set up.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.200]   You can use Hover just for the registrar, but they also offer email and very, very good email.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.880]   I've said for a long time, if email is important to you and it is, isn't it? You should be paying
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:59.360]   for it. You shouldn't be using some free service from a company that provides no support. With Hover,
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.120]   it's easy to set up. You can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need. It's simple because
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.520]   when your domain renews and you can set it on auto-renew, your mailboxes renew as well.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.200]   Very affordable. Their most popular mailbox is basically a no-brainer solution for business owners.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:22.240]   So you got the domain, you know, ice cream at leosisecreamshop.com. You can get access from
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.000]   anywhere because of course it's real email, which means you can use the email app you're already
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.280]   comfortable with. They won't throw you a curve by changing your password and doing weird stuff
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:37.120]   like AOL has been doing. But it's also webmail. If you say, "Well, no, but the reason I like
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   Gmail is because I can do it on the web." Hover is the email. The webmail is fantastic.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:47.040]   I just, I think this is just the place. There's also a nice thing about Hover. They don't upsell
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.520]   you like most other registrars. It is not 15 pages of things you could buy. For instance,
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:57.840]   I know you want who is privacy. It's built in. No checkbox. Can you do that for me? No. It's part
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.800]   of the price. It's included with your purchase. So your private information stays private. You
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.160]   reduce spam. You protect yourself from unwanted solicitations. And frankly, you don't want your
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:15.040]   email and your phone number and your home address on the internet in the public eye anyway for lots
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:22.080]   of good reasons. Hover has great pro-level tools. I go right there directly to DNS page and manage
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:28.160]   it, but they also have simple Hover Connect. One click if you're not a DNS whiz to let's,
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.920]   you pick the service you want to use and host your website so that it's easy to connect it.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.360]   And Hover, this is really important. You're a customer. You're not a source of data. Take back
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.520]   control of your data. Reliable, tracker-free email. And a company that really cares. We've
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.920]   been using them for years. Hover is trusted by hundreds of thousands of customers who use their
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.400]   domain names and their email to turn their ideas into a reality. Whether you're a developer,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.760]   photographer, or small business, I have dozens of domains at Hover. And I use a lot of them.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.200]   Surprisingly, there's a lot of reasons you might want your own domain name. Hover is something for
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.240]   you to expand your projects and get the visibility you want. Go to hover.com/twit. You do it right
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:16.720]   now. You'll get 10% off your first purchase of any domain extension for the whole year. Hover.com/twit,
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:22.800]   10% off your domain extension for a full year. And simply the best domain registrar out there.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.600]   It's just a no-brainer. Hover. Hover.com/twit. Please use that address so you know you saw it.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:38.480]   Please. I beg of you. Thank you, Hover. Are you on the beta channel, Jason, for Ventura?
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.120]   Yes, sir. Now, you're on the public or the dev beta?
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.520]   Developer beta. You got a new one.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.280]   It's sitting here waiting to install, but I would not be on Macbreak weekly if I did it.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:57.600]   So I'm waiting. Please wait. Beta 10. So this actually ties into this whole speculation about
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:03.200]   what's going to happen when Apple announces new Macs, which they probably will do this month,
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.720]   but we'd still think. Probably.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.160]   Gurman is saying, "Yeah, I don't think it's going to be an event."
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.960]   And Gurman, to be clear, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who's become famous because he has very good
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.720]   sources, has been, I think, he's also becoming a pundit a little bit. And we need to go on our--
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.640]   He says, "I think." This is an idea. It's not a report.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.880]   Yeah. It's not a report at all. And I could make the counter-argument that he really hedges.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.720]   He's like, "Well, I don't think it'll be a big thing." And it's like, "Well, what does that mean?
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.680]   There are going to be new products this month, but I think that I reminded the last year I think
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.400]   Apple did a sub one hour video event one time. And they don't have to invite people to Apple
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.520]   Park. So it would be very simple for Apple to do a smaller iPad and Mac product rollout that was
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.360]   still like a video event that they held because that's how they get people to pay attention.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.800]   Like, a press release gets some attention, but it's mediated by all of us in the media, right?
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.240]   Whereas a video that goes for an hour that just goes straight in your eyes,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.600]   like there's nobody else. It's just you and Apple. And that's much more effective
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.680]   media marketing and PR for them. So I think that it's entirely possible that that's what we're
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.160]   headed for as a small product rollout video event. And then they'll bring in the media
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.880]   privately to do briefings and stuff like that.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:23.120]   I'm just looking at the calendar. This is the first Tuesday in October.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:30.240]   Of course, Thursday, day after tomorrow, Pixel 6/7, rather, event with Google. Andy,
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.280]   you want to join me for that, by the way. You're more than one, two, if you'd like.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.080]   I'm going to be at the event. Oh, you lucky dog. You're going to Brooklyn.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.920]   Yep. I'm going to take it to Brooklyn, baby. I got the golden ticket to Brooklyn.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.400]   That's the sixth. And then Microsoft's doing a surface event. And I have to say,
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.800]   I mean, the surfaces are really, to some degree, aimed at the iPad, their tablets,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.720]   even though they're running Windows. That's the next week, that's Wednesday, the 12th.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.040]   So I think the 18th would be a reasonable day.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   I think the 18th is, I think, I agree with you. I think 18th gets it far enough away from their
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.440]   iPhone rollout and gives them plenty of time to get that. I mean, the mystery is always what's
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.320]   going to be in the channel. They're not going to do an event until they know they've got products
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   ready to sell. And so what's the state of the supply chain? But I think that's probably the
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.920]   most likely day. They were releasing their corporate results the week from that Thursday,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.120]   the next week. So they could be that week. Would it?
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.280]   So prock 27th? They could. They could do it, but probably not. It'll probably be on the
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:38.400]   it's narrowing down the news is tightening on the 18th. So you would get an invitation,
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.360]   I think, probably in the next week. So it would be, I mean, if it's just briefings,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.960]   it would be more like they'll, you know, they'll announce that they're doing an event a week in
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.800]   advance. And then they'll send me, if I get a briefing, it'll be an email saying, Jason,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.200]   are you available at, you know, whatever? And sometimes it's Jason, are you available in,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.240]   in a week to fly across the countries? Which is weird, but sometimes that happens.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.560]   You wouldn't have to. You're in your next extort of Cupertino.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.880]   I know it would be that's the most convenient thing is I can drive to Cupertino. I occasionally,
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.320]   what they'll do is they'll say, Oh, we want to talk to you and Mike on upgrade and we're going to
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.240]   furnish an executive to you, but the executives are briefing everybody in New York. So can you
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.680]   fly to New York? That's happened to me three times. So if it does, I'll, I'll go, but I'd much
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.760]   rather just drive to Cupertino. Yeah. It's a nice place to be.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:31.040]   Ask me why, ask me why I'm intending the Google event and the Microsoft event in person because
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:37.760]   A, they're in track and B, I look at the invitation that look at, okay, what's, what's
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.120]   play? What's, what are they showing at the, at the Met that night? Oh, an idea. Great.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.840]   I'll definitely, I'll definitely, yes, RSVP positive. I will definitely be there for Lady
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.320]   McBetham who wins. Well, I'm going to be a little less culture in Cupertino. I'm afraid.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.200]   I'm going to be streaming the, the pixel of it's good.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.000]   Ron at seven in the morning, our time. This is what I don't like about East Coast events.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.200]   I have to get up early. I'll be doing that by myself because Jason Hell has, as the week off. So
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.920]   I will be, I will be there. You can tune in seven a.m. on the sixth and see me in my jammies.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:16.480]   I'll, I'll wear my shark slippers for you, Kevin. And, uh, wow. Okay. And then the 12th, I don't,
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.360]   I don't know. I guess we'll stream that too. We have to. So, and you're invited to an event on
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   the 12th. That's interesting because we were wondering if they would be an event or if Pannos
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.440]   Pane would just record something in his living room. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I don't, I don't have an
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.840]   invite to an event. You don't have an event. Okay. As it, as, as it happens, I was, I was playing
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   on going, you're getting down. Just in case. It's like the, you know, the, the great thing about
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:45.120]   the Met is that some of their productions, they're just so freaking weird that after seeing like
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.160]   post of, after seeing like my third or first post of that is the weirdest damn thing I have
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.160]   ever seen on a stage. Can I, can I get super cheap? Like $30? I can get the $30 fair.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.360]   Okay. I might have to go see that. So yes. So when it, so that's why I was probably through,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.480]   oh, wow, there's a Microsoft event. I wonder if it's in New York and if suddenly this,
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.080]   this impulsive trip to New York is now tax deductible.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:17.280]   Anyway, so the release of Ventura developer beta 10. Is that magic? Does that mean like,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.120]   or this is the golden master? I don't think it's magic, but it does feel like they're wrapping up.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.560]   There might be one more in the cycle. I don't know, but it does feel like they're, you know,
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.520]   trying to get the bugs knocked out as best they can. The catch is that this is going to be a
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:38.240]   simultaneous release, presumably with both iPad OS 16.1 and iOS 16.1 and that they'll probably turn
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:43.840]   on iCloud shared photo library at that point. And you know, it's a, you know, with Apple now,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.920]   with these three operating systems, everything's, ideally they want to turn the lights on at the
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.920]   same time across all of them. So we'll see. Yeah. So venture, a lot of the stuff is anticipation
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:00.880]   of Ventura because this is, it's, it's rare to come up with a different version of the, of Mac OS
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:07.360]   that is so well tied in with, with iPad OS and iPhone OS. Yeah. I mean, there are,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.320]   they've been working on this for a long time, but it has never been a tighter integration across
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.600]   all three. And you know, you don't, the last thing you want, this is why the shared photo library is
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   not in iOS 16 right now is because you, your photos would disappear on all your other Apple
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.200]   devices because it's not on the Mac and the iPad yet. So they got a, they got a stage all of that.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:34.400]   And you know, it's, it's just came out. So we don't actually know if there are any like signs of,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.200]   of major bug fixes or major changes to stage manager or anything like that. I'm sure we'll know
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.280]   probably by the time this episode gets posted, we'll know more about it, but it does feel like that
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   they're, they're trying to get it. I don't want to say they're closing the books on it just yet,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.080]   but I would say they're trying to get it at a stable point where they can mark it and say,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:59.600]   let's let this one out and then move on to 16.2 or, or Ventura, 0.1 or whatever. Yeah.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:06.160]   Yeah. You haven't installed it. So I won't ask you any questions about it. There is an
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:15.040]   actual interesting story about the iOS 16.1 fourth seat is out. According to Mark Gurman,
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:23.200]   I believe this is a, I've heard rather than I think the iOS 16.1 beta brings adaptive transparency
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.800]   to the original AirPods Pro. You could see the setting right here. Gurman says, I'm told this
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:36.400]   is a bug. That's a bug. Whoops. Never mind. Well, it's weird too because you've got to be on,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:43.040]   you've got to get a beta profile of the, the, the AirPods Pro firmware to, you know, it has its
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.960]   own beta profile because then you've got to update the firmware to a beta firmware and then you see
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.200]   this setting. So it's, it's deep, deep down and it's not surprising, I think, that they might have
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.160]   said, you know, whoops, what you, you didn't, you didn't say not the first generation. And so
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:03.040]   everybody got really excited. Yeah. And given that the, the sample rate of the first AirPods Pro is half
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:10.000]   the sample rate. It's a, it's a 24 instead of 48 kilohertz. And this is what the whole adaptive
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.720]   transparency is based on. It's not surprising that this is a mistake. Yeah. In fact, they have now
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:23.120]   shipped a 16.1 beta four that fixed the mistake. It's, it's been removed. Sorry to get your hopes
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.960]   have you played with adaptive? I can't really, the transparency is nice. I usually just want noise
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.800]   cancellation. I don't want to hear anything. So I haven't really played with it. I guess so if
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.200]   you're walking or running or bicycling in the, in public, that might be a nice thing to have.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.080]   Yeah. When I run, I have transparency on when I'm on streets and then I'll turn the noise canceling
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.280]   on when I'm, when I'm off on a sidewalk or on a trail or something where I'm not crossing streets.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.080]   So having that, it sounds for audio geeks. I mean, it does really sound like they're,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.960]   they're doing a big dynamic range thing where they're looking for, for high volumes and they're
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.920]   just beating them down so that, that your volume is a little more consistent. And I, I have not
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:10.800]   yet experienced that, but um, you know, transparency mode is a great mode. And they got a balance like,
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.160]   you, you wanted to like, you want to hear that car coming. Right. Right. But, but like a jackhammer,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.040]   maybe not so loud. So I, I haven't tried that yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.440]   Yeah. I mean, I haven't noticed, I wore a, I wore it yesterday on a train and the noise
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.760]   cancellation is fantastic. I have to say, it really does a great job. And it's, it makes the,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.320]   listening to a book on a, on a commuter train and just a really pleasant experience.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:43.280]   Yeah. I'm really curious to see, I'm, I'm, I'm scared to see what Apple might announce in
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:50.080]   October, which is when they, which is when the legal, the legal barrier exists to basically,
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.560]   when, when it becomes legal to sell hearing aid devices without actually having prescription,
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:03.120]   without being certified as hearing aids per se, that I'm really keen to see if Apple and Sony
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.800]   and Google and all these other companies are making really high quality in-year buds with all
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.240]   of this processing in it. If they simply say, guess what? We've just given you an upgrade.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   Now it's a hearing aid here's, but here's a special app you're going to have to download and install
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.280]   in order to manage it as a, as an assistive hearing device. Yeah. I think that is probably
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.520]   coming. There's a lot of mystery. Like, um, the fact that they announced, I know we talked about
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.400]   this, um, after the event, but the fact that they announced this amazing new high bandwidth
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.560]   capability of the AirPods Pro 2 and then never said anything about what it was for. Right.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.440]   Like I suspect there's, there is probably stuff baked into that hardware that they just aren't
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.720]   ready to reveal yet, which is never buy something hoping that there'll be a software update to,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.560]   uh, make it better because they may let you down. They probably will. But in this case,
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.280]   I suspect that Apple's got, um, don't forget also their, they've got their classical music service
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.920]   that their rumor to be launching. Um, yeah, they're talking about it. They've, they've talked about
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   it. Well, they've been off because they bought, what was it, Annie, that we loved the classical
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.640]   music service and shut it down. I was so pissed off about that. Yeah. And it's not the rumors
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.760]   that that might even happen as soon as this month that they would launch and they're going to put
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.200]   it in its own app, a classical app, even though it's Apple music. And because classical is very different
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.760]   from how you catalog it and listen it and all that. And yeah, I wonder if there's a kind of a,
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.920]   uh, a music and AirPods related announcement that they might make, but Andy's, Andy's absolutely,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:30.640]   I'm 100% with Andy about, um, the hearing aid thing. Cause like all of these wireless buds with
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:35.040]   all that high tech in them are sitting right out there and I'm watching, you know, I'm watching
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.600]   football games where they're advertising like, don't go see a doctor just order this $99
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:47.280]   hearing rate. And I'm thinking to myself, Oh my God, don't do that. Don't, what is that? Don't buy it.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.880]   And I think that we're seeing this across the board. Like when we talk to developers,
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.600]   we just keep on saying they just keep pulling more power out of a lot of the hardware that
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.000]   Apple's building right now. They're almost over building a lot of the hardware to give the,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.760]   the developers headroom, you know, and give themselves headroom to keep growing into it. And so it's
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.920]   a really interesting puzzle that we haven't seen in the past. You know, usually it's, you know,
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.560]   but, but they're, they're just a lot to this that, that if you're taking advantage of the OS,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.880]   um, you're getting a lot of that stuff for free.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:21.440]   We did they, they never said LC three, the new Bluetooth codec in the, the announcement,
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:27.040]   but I know I'm wondering if that's one of the features that we'll see. Cause that's a much lower
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   or much better percussion. The problem with Bluetooth is highly compressed. It has to be.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.880]   It's a low bandwidth pipe from the headphones to your phone. But as Bluetooth improves and
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.480]   there's no codec codecs come along, it could, it should sound better and better and better.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:45.120]   Um, it says, I have to say it sounds better than I expected.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:53.520]   Yeah. No, it's, I, that's excellent. By the way, the, the noise case, I just,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   just working so well. I think, I think it's because all of us were so eager to jump in.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.400]   We didn't want to talk over each other. We'll go ahead first, Danny. Okay. But that, see, but
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:08.320]   that is always an item of interest for me because there is such a barrier between,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.760]   this is so good that it's good enough for this. This is good enough for me. I don't think that I
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.320]   can appreciate it. Maybe you can prove to me that this is better in terms of the aesthetic
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.880]   experience of that, but it's not so much that I can really notice it. I think that has to do with
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:28.240]   both audio and when it's a video announcement. And then there are the people for whom it's like,
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.600]   no, I just want what is even if it's just a, even if it's just a spectrograph that tells me
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   here is the, here is the improvement in quality between A and B that we are way past the time where
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.800]   a compressed audio stream versus like a CD quality lossless recording is easy to detect.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:52.480]   Now the streaming, both with the, both with the, the compression algorithms, the streaming algorithms
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.120]   and the compression algorithms that wirelessly stream something between the device and your,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.400]   in your earbuds, they're so good now that you really have to have, you have to be one of those
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.760]   people that really does say, no, it does matter to me. Even if you, if I do a side by side and
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.120]   only by the side by side comparison, do I sense a difference between A and B, that means that I
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.600]   will definitely want B just on principle. There's a certain amount of education that goes on too.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:24.000]   If you are shown and taught what to listen for, you can't unhear it. And so if you know what to
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   listen for in MP3s that are artifacts of compression, you can't hear it and you won't stop hearing it
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.840]   until they fix it. And also, but lastly, I'm sorry, I know everyone that the, I've run
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.320]   else wants to jump in here, but I'll just, I'll send my, and my, my, my rant here that the other
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:46.400]   part of this is that I think that's why spatial audio is becoming, is getting a lot of traction
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:53.040]   because it is one of the few things that you can hear a difference that you instantly hear like,
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.240]   like, this is a, the AP is no, wow, this is a totally separate experience. Wow, I totally hear
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:03.920]   this. Wow, this is totally interesting. Whereas if you simply said, Oh, well, here is a compares,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.240]   a compressed file that you bought that you got streamed versus here is a high quality,
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:14.320]   high definition, high, whatever. I don't see, I still don't know if people are going to be so much
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.720]   into high into spatial audio that they're willing to buy new hardware, they're willing to buy
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   new speaker sets for their living rooms are willing to buy this, that and the other. But I think
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.520]   sometimes the difference, the reason why some technology gets traction and some doesn't is simply
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:34.160]   because it demos so much more clearly, so much more, so much more, you have to tell the official
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.560]   is chart example, find out what it is. You can hear the difference. Yeah. Right. Alex,
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:44.880]   did you want to throw in on this? Yeah, I mean, I think that it's going to be it is definitely,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:53.840]   I guess I generally find that in a general use of how I'm using the headsets, quality is really high.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   If I want to sit and be an audio file, that's different. I want to wired, but then you
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.920]   say, I want to set an experience album or something like that. That's one thing, but I think that
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.600]   we're getting to a point again that we're good. And I have different headsets because I decide
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.480]   what I'm going to do with them. So I think the bows that kind of formed your ears, I think they
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.840]   sound better than the AirPods, but their mic is horrible. So if I'm going to talk, I just want
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:27.200]   those ones. The one I use the most is actually the shocks, comms, comms. Yeah. Well, yeah. And the
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:33.280]   reason I do that is because the boom mic makes my mic, it's better at noise reduction for the listener
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.680]   on the other side of the call. So if I'm on a call, that's all I use because I know that I can
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.400]   do things around that office and no one's going to hear it. Oh, they changed their name to shocks,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:48.080]   not after the shocks. Yeah. And so that one I wear and the other one, the open comm you see is
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:52.560]   what you like. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one I use because of that. It's because of the boom,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.520]   you know, because of the boom, and what I can also do with it is, is I can, I can listen to a show
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.640]   and listen to comms. It's many calls open comms, but I put those over top of my head, my earphone. So
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.680]   working on a live show and I'm listening to the to the show, but I can still add my
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:12.640]   yeah, that's that's why we love two headsets. We love the aftershocks and Lisa still wears them
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:18.720]   when we're exercising because you're not sealed away. The audio is not as good. It is no question.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:24.080]   It's not as good. No, it's not. I'm not going to do that. But for me, I listen to it's better
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.520]   headset and and I will say with the with the with the shocks as I forget that they're there.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.440]   Like I just yeah, because it's not comfortable affecting it. I just I just have one all day.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:37.760]   I think they were never so as you're when I were named after shocks. I don't know why they
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:43.600]   change the name is shocks. Anyway, so it's anyway, it's so I think it depends on what you're using
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.960]   them for. That's a good point. If you can afford it and it's part of your business as it is for you,
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   it makes sense to have different so many devices for this wired ones and unwired ones and the
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.840]   max is what I know. If I'm going to sit out of my hammock or something, then I'm then I just put
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:06.000]   the max. Yeah, the max is over. Talk to you. Yeah. I have to say though, I've been pretty I was
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.840]   not an AirPods fan. These the new pros are pretty good. They're much more comfortable. I think
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:17.120]   they feel very well. The sound quality is good. I think and I was the pros. The pros themselves
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.520]   are much more comfortable. Like I go back to the old ones. These old ones are awful. I'm like,
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:27.600]   what was I thinking? They were always terrible. I never wore those. I like the wireless charging.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:32.160]   Yeah, it is still a lightning port, but I don't I never use it because I just plop them on a
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.000]   the wireless charger. You can use the Apple Watts charger now too, which I have extras of over
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.840]   the years. I have two million extras. You got to find in my case, it's like now I need a USB
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.880]   A charging port, but I have some in like a wall outlet. It's great. I can just have a little
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.040]   little separate magnetic charger if I want, which is nice, but I mostly yeah, just use my
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.520]   Qi charger plus. It's got the it's got the ultra wide band in it. So if you lose in your couch
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.640]   cushions or whatever, you can find it immediately. And it also has a speaker, right? So it'll it'll
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.040]   you can make a chirp and you can find it now. They just do that with the Apple TV remote.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.560]   Right. Exactly. Like how do we not have the beeping for the controller? I mean, it's it's like
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.720]   literally three or four times. It's most like it. I have a family. Yeah. There's three or four times
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.160]   a week that we're like where the controller is. And it's somewhere in the couch.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.360]   Still, by the way, despite the worst TV remote in history, I mean, they really
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:38.240]   I would say the zenas used to it. Zenas might be worse. You think? I'm obviously zenas 1950.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.600]   The one word actually just does a chime. That would have been. Yeah.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.280]   All right. Yeah. But I'm.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.120]   I'm so touchy even even now with the track. So touchy that I invariably
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.400]   sit on it and stop or rewind or fast forward when I'm watching and it's incredibly annoying.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   Well, I guess for me, the big thing is that I what I hate is how different
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.920]   different apps interpret the movement like I really feel like Apple should enforce more of
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.680]   these like do it like for instance HBO Max if you see an image you see you see a show and you go.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.480]   I would like to look at that series, but you click on it and you have to like pound on it a
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.560]   bunch of different ways. That drives me nuts. And then and then yell at it and then eventually
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.840]   you get to the episodes and you don't know how you got there, but you're now looking at the
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.280]   episodes. I'm like, I don't I didn't want to go to that episode. I wanted to go to the
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.240]   group of episodes that are connected to this, you know, and it's impossible on the Mac on the
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.760]   Apple universe. And of course, you go right to the episodes. You don't go right to the
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.640]   I guess HBO Max decided that they thought that was a better user. Yeah, well, the software.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.400]   That's a whole nother problem. It's the same problem as it is on iOS, which is unlike the Mac,
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.240]   Apple did not make clear user interface design guidelines and people just do whatever the
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.480]   hell they want. But I will say that my I complain about it. My kids, they understand how it is.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.520]   My sign just goes like this. He is just dead. Dead. Just hand me. He's just put his hand out.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.680]   Snap. It's all in the rest. Dead. Just come on. That. Hand me that big. Like stop playing with
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.560]   it. Just give it to me. I will invariably start an episode that I don't want to watch.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.400]   Yeah, exactly. Because there's no easy way to get to the previous episode that I do want to watch.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:28.160]   And then there's the fact that that YouTube and trailers is like 16 dB louder than everything else.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:35.840]   Well, I just need the Apple TV should know that and be able to go, hey, I'm going to keep them all
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.480]   the same. A lot of streaming devices and certainly most AV receivers have a
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.560]   leveling noise leveling feature where you say, keep everything the same
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.120]   volume. I don't want it that burst. I guess mine's a pretty nice one. They could build it into
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.000]   the Apple TV. Well, that and then audio sync. Like you can do audio sync to wireless speakers,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.560]   but you can't do audio sync to the wired ones. And it's off. Talking about charging your AirPods
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:08.160]   Pro. I have found a new use for the useless MagSafe battery pack. Because I don't need it.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.960]   I don't really use it. I bought it back when it came out. But but the magnet on that's nice and
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.840]   strong. And when you put the AirPods Pro on there goes, and then it dings and it's beautiful. So,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:24.240]   it's actually my new AirPods Pro charger. Nice. Jason, do you want to talk about
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.960]   codecs or anything in that vein? codecs. I love a codec. I love a codec. Who doesn't?
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.640]   Another great that codec moment. That's told people that you have you have two codec podcasts
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:43.040]   we're going on right now. Probably does. Well, well, yes. Why yes, Andy? One is the compression
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   podcast and one is the decompression. Together. Two together. I don't know. I mean, basically,
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.200]   I wonder if there's another shoe to drop with the AirPods Pro in terms of them doing a higher
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.280]   quality thing, even if it's not lossless. They might make some sort of claim. But otherwise,
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.600]   I'm just I was a big fan of the AirPods Pro and I was I hated Apple's headphones for the longest
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.200]   time. I've got like my fancy in-ear monitors and I did get tired of like having my headphones
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.920]   getting yanked out of my ears when I was doing the dishes or mowing the lawn and by just grabbing
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.680]   on the cable, right? And and AirPods Pro's the original AirPods Pro's completely like there are
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.920]   very few listing contexts where I don't just use them now because they're so good. They're not
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.800]   perfect, but they're so good. And the AirPods Pro too. Yeah, that noise canceling is better.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:37.120]   The fit is better. The charging is better. The case is better. Like I haven't tried all the
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.000]   ones on the market. So I can't say whether they are the best out there, but I they are very, very good.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.400]   We are we are in agreement. That's the codec. That's that's my codec. That's your codec.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.480]   I will I will say that if there's one documentary that I would fund and absolutely see about
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.840]   engineering design at an Apple, it is about the operating systems. They're great. The phones,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.800]   they're great. All the services, they're great, but it's I'm fascinated by the teams that put
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.200]   together things that are designed to be held. Things that actually have to interact directly
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.240]   with your body. I mean, you think about like how much work has to go into just the shape of a mouse.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:21.520]   And it's and it's the thing that you we are built with these sensory inputs that are active all the
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.480]   time. And so how do you figure out how to make a remote for a TV that that satisfies every design
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.560]   element that's technical, every design that element that is marketing related, meaning that it has to
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.880]   be small enough to fit in the box and not make it more expensive to ship these in containers
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.160]   across overseas, but also so it doesn't frustrate the hell out of you when you're just holding this
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.360]   thing in your hand when you're trying to relax or an AirPods where it has to be comfortable enough
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.200]   that you want to wear it. It has to also be comfortable enough that you're confident that
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.680]   you're not going to be see you can you can actually like move your head normally without
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.520]   worrying about sending one of these $250 AirPods like into the subway grade. I don't think that
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   there's enough talked about about the work that goes into that because those people as much as
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.960]   much as much as I love to complain about the remote much as I love to complain about the shape of the
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:17.120]   Apple magic mouse. I cannot imagine how much work has to go into just figuring out how to deal with
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.840]   this part of the interface in a way that most people who have these things are going to enjoy.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.920]   Right. Earlier ears, right? Like ear shape is not something that we think about a whole lot.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.560]   And I remember when the original AirPods Pro came out, one of the things that the Apple PR people
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.520]   and product managers said to me in my briefing was that they actually used a new data set because
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.480]   they had had like apparently there is a you know you can get a data set of like one of the common
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.320]   ear shapes and all of that. And they felt like it was too if I read between the lines, I think it
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.640]   was too Silicon Valley a set. And they said that with the AirPods Pro, they actually tried to get
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:56.160]   a wider range of human ear shapes because they felt like they were not. I think they realized that
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.320]   their earbuds worked really well with like dudes in Silicon Valley. And then you get to the rest of
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.480]   the world and they didn't work as well. And but that's a hard problem, right? Because there are
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:10.080]   people in the discord and in the RSC chat right now as we record this saying, oh, these don't work
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.920]   for me or but these work great for me. And you're never going to please everybody. But imagine how
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   hard it must be to try and look at the range of human ear shape and try to figure out what's the
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.720]   right shape that gets us the biggest collection of those people. That's a hard job.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:31.200]   Yeah, I still love my favorite ear ear earbuds are still like the Pixel Series A, the $99 ones that
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.360]   I will tell you don't sound as good as the AirPods Pro that I tried. Don't don't sound as good as
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.720]   the Sony, not the current generation of an earbuds, but the ones that are previous that I own. But
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.400]   I wear them all the time. If I'm going to be wearing them for more than a couple more than an hour or
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.920]   two, I wear them all the time because they have that not only the nicely shaped, but they also
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.360]   have that extra little like Silicon tail that at least on my air shape, it just tucks beautifully
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:01.680]   into one of these little folds of my ear so that that sucker is not coming out. I don't feel it
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.320]   at all, but there is no point which I feel kind of wanting to eject. I never have to like actually
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.800]   do one of these in order to get it to stay in. And so it doesn't the other technology does not
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.880]   matter. All they did was they added a little spur of Silicon to it. Silicon to it. Is that funny?
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.360]   I'm always making sure I don't say Silicon when I mean to say Silicon in like actual electronics
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.880]   design. Here's the ones I'm doing the exact opposite. No, it is silicone in this one.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.040]   Yeah, but but they don't make chips. But they are used in the breast enhancements.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.800]   So there is a difference. That's the thing which got so unfired. We're going to get to that story.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.040]   We'll get to that. Oh, word from our sponsor. Yeah, congratulations. You just
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.960]   thank yourself. Hey, Jason, one question though, and you probably saw it in our IRC. How is the
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.440]   microphone on the AirPods too? I haven't tested that yet. It is a good question because people
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.760]   complained about the microphone on the first one a lot. It's tricky because I've got to first
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.120]   off, I've got to have somebody else there to talk to. Yeah, yeah. And then I've got to be like, okay,
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.800]   here take these and talk to me and then go now now switch to the other ones. You know what I do?
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.040]   I leave myself a message, but that's not probably the perfect way to do it either. I'm not sure
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:16.160]   that's the best way either. But yeah, it's true. If there was a real fatal flaw, a fatal flaw for
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.800]   those who actually use their phones to talk to people on the phone, which I mean, I try not to,
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.120]   but it was that the microphones weren't that great. So I'm hoping that and I think that's not
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.240]   just a hardware problem. I think there were some software problems there. So hopefully they've
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.080]   fixed that, but I haven't tested it. It's only a fatal flaw if it makes your head explode. Then
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.760]   that could be a fatal flaw. And a spinal tap drummers.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.480]   That's that's that's definitely half a star off on the Verge review. I think that's actual
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:46.640]   and it's a policy. Yeah, take it down to a 7.5. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by Zipper
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.960]   Cruder. We hire with Zipper Cruder. Some of our best employees came to us through Zipper Cruder.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.120]   In fact, really, there's only two ways we hire. We know someone like you, John Ashley, and we
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.880]   told you it was easy. We knew you or when we have to post it, we post on Zipper Cruder. Lisa loves
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.720]   Zipper Cruder because one post goes to more than a hundred other job boards plus social networks.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.080]   So you're reaching out the widest possible net. But then the next best thing about Zipper Cruder
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:22.000]   is it will actually go through the millions of resumes they have on file and suggest people to
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.560]   you saying, you know, these these five people really match your qualifications. You might want to
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.560]   you might want to talk to them. Then you invite them. They don't invite them for you. You invite
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.680]   them, which is what you want. You know, you know, obviously you want some control over this.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.720]   But I have to say, when you invite people, they respond. They love it. They feel like, wow, I've
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.520]   been seen. And that's really great. We have a, you know, not a huge staff, but we got we got
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:55.120]   people. We just for instance, our beloved continuity person Ashley left got a got another job, I guess
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.320]   closer to home. And, well, you know, that's tough when we're down a person. That means more work for
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:06.480]   everybody posted it to Zipper Cruder. It didn't take, I think Lisa was saying, oh, we got through.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.680]   Oh, here's another one. Oh, we got like three or four in the same day. Really good qualified people.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.320]   And we hired Viva shortly thereafter. She's been great. It really, it works. We, we know it works.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.960]   There are a lot of podcasts out there. And if you're a podcaster,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.480]   Jason, you need to hire the right people for those roles, engineers, editors, producers,

[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:21.280]   that we hire come to a Zipper Cruder. Yeah. It really, it really does work.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.800]   Okay. So just a little, if you are looking for work, a little tip, the next time a Tiktoker comes
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.680]   up to you and says, Hey, what do you do for a living? Probably best not to quote Dudley
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.160]   Moore from Arthur. I'm just saying not a good idea. Choose your, choose your quotes widely.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.680]   Turns out this Tiktoker, this particular Tiktoker had quite a following. I follow him. His whole
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:54.320]   thing is he goes up to people in fancy cars and says, what do you do? In this case,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   he went up to the blevinator. That's, that's actually apparently what they call him inside Apple,
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.760]   the blevinator. We wait a minute. We wait a minute. Bloomberg says he was
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.720]   glo-viating. He was blo-viating. He drives a pretty fancy car, right? I mean, it's not a,
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.400]   it's not a an everyday vehicle. I'm, I'm not looking at a pretty good job. Had, he had a pretty good job.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.480]   Bloomberg's making a lot of doosers. Jump through some hoops. Sorry to get to this.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.000]   Let me see if I can find the Tiktok. He's driving a Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.600]   That's a, according to the Tiktok, it's Daniel Mack, a half million dollar vehicle. He's also
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.560]   wearing, I might point out a powder blue suit with red shoes. So you know, he's got to be rich.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.600]   Because anybody with a real job wouldn't dress like that. But that's this kind of
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.440]   confidence that only a whole lot of money will suffice.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.560]   When asked what he does for a living, Tony Blevins, who I should point out was
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:14:02.080]   Tim Cook's right hand guy, vice president procurement. The guy who makes the deals with
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:09.040]   people like Foxconn, he said, and I'm quoting him, please, he is paraphrasing Arthur,
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.440]   I have rich cars. I play golf and fondle big breasted women, but I take weekends and major
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.640]   holidays off. He also said I have a hell of a dental plan. Now, I didn't know that was Arthur,
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.000]   but it's been pointed out that was Arthur. Arthur is a famous drunk
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.560]   from a movie from the early 80s from the early 80s.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.080]   Hey, back in the days when you could have a charming, charming, charming leading man in a
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.640]   comedy who was a responsible billionaire who's ever worked in a dangerous life and also drives
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:46.240]   while drunk. Yeah. The 80s were a very different time, everybody, children. It was a different
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.760]   time. Even even Arthur, though, wasn't quite. He didn't, there was no big breasted in the
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:15:00.480]   Arthur quote. He said, I fondle women. Yes. So I am my embossed. Yes. So so basically,
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.680]   if you're thinking that he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he was just quoting something blindly
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.760]   and didn't have presence of mind to edit. No, he did leave out the line where I am my own boss.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.080]   Oh, he could have said, oh, yeah, maybe he was thinking that thing to tell you. Yeah.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:24.000]   Anyway, this happened in a TikTok video clip, which was viewed by more than 1.4 million people.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.040]   I maybe he didn't know he was talking to Daniel Mack. Maybe that was, maybe that was it.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.520]   Yeah, but an Apple executive should know better than anyone working in Apple should
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.000]   know better than to have someone walk up to a camera regardless of any following that they
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.800]   possibly have and say something so inappropriate. Let's just, there's just exactly my audio.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:50.640]   Now to this. Oh, yeah, I see it's on the video. I have to click that button. Thank you.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.480]   Thank you, John Ashley. Let's play just, you know, why not, you know, cost him his job.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.920]   Good sir. Your car is awesome. What do you do for a living? Oh, wait a minute. I got to point out
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.280]   he's got going doors too. I did. I missed that. No. And he's sitting with a woman who, as I
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.960]   presume, is she's wearing a wedding ring, his wife. So maybe he thought she would appreciate this.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.160]   I'll raise cars, play golf and fondle big breasted women.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:22.480]   But I think we can do major holidays off. Okay. I just like to. She's laughing. I heard her
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.240]   cackle in the background. She appreciated that. Looking to get into that.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.840]   Oh, so your interest and I got a hell of a dental plan. Okay. You do it all. You do it all.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.760]   And you know, to add in a tribute to Dudley Moore in Arthur, he is wearing a vest, a waistcoat,
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:44.000]   as Dudley might say, which are the Union Jack, the British flag. So maybe he thought this would be,
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.400]   you know, understood, wasn't understood apparently on the internal Apple message boards where
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:58.960]   he had the drumbeat crew. And he was he has been he has been he after an internal investigation
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.960]   of the matter. Blevins team, which included a half a dozen direct reports and several hundreds
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:10.880]   employees, was removed from his command. At which point he's been at Apple 22 years. He confirmed
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.080]   the incident to Bloomberg saying Bloomberg saying the encounter took place August 18th.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:23.600]   I would like to take this opportunity. It sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.360]   mistaken attempt at humor. That's a very that's a very app selection because he is now working as
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:37.120]   a chimney sweep. I'd like to fondle your big breasts. And Apple spokesman said Thursday,
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:46.320]   Blevins is departing the Cupertino, California based company. Yeah, it is just like that scene
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:52.320]   in a face of a face in the crowd. Andy Griffin, where his is super, super popular folksy, like
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.560]   TV person, like doesn't know the doesn't know the microphone is open. The mic is still open and
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.800]   the camera is still live and says me says horrible things about his audience. And then he says,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.200]   Ah, yes, I'm on the top of the world gets in the elevator. Like the 30th floor broadcasting studio.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.400]   And as you see, they keep cutting between like how quickly the phone phone the phone calls were
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.440]   coming in as he's descending. And as soon as he gets out and gets into his car, his career is over.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.280]   Yeah. And I've worked on a lot of political things. And we've had situations where someone
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   says something on a mic that was not one that we control because we are maniacal about keeping
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:32.880]   the mics out. And you know, we'd rather make a mistake of having to be quiet for a moment rather
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.440]   than open. But but we've seen other engineers leave it open because it's just easier. There's a lot
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.880]   of moving parts and someone comes up and says something that they think is funny, you know, and
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.440]   it's it's out of context and everything else. But literally, we I was at a convention, you know,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.200]   political convention. I watched someone say something and I was like, well, that's the end of his career.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.040]   Yeah. And he was like, within, you know, like, like he just like as soon as you as soon as he came
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.120]   out as a mouth, I was like, well, we're done. You know, and and and and do you think it was fair?
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.080]   I mean, honestly, uh, leavens is reportedly very was very good at his job. Jeff Williams will be
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.040]   taking over until they find somebody that was indefensible at this point. I mean,
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.080]   defensive. Yeah. It's in the problem. Is it? You know, look, he's at the Concordelligals
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:18.000]   in a pebble beach in his very, very fancy car in his British vest. Uh, he probably didn't know,
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.880]   even look, this is what Daniel Mack does. He's got 13 million followers on TikTok because he
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.280]   ambushes people and they often say stupid things. I, you know, did does he say, I don't know, did he
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.920]   say up front? Hey, before I record this, I'm Daniel Mack with 13 million followers on TikTok.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.400]   He shouldn't say that. Yeah. He shouldn't say that outside of his house. He probably shouldn't say
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.040]   it in his house. Like, you know, like, you know, that's not like, you know, that's not like,
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:48.160]   let him off the hook that he was quoting Arthur at all. I just think that again, for someone who
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:54.880]   works at Apple, the lack of, of, um, understanding of how that's going to look for the brand is, uh,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:00.160]   it's kind of nutty, you know, like, and so, and so the thing is, is that I think that it, you know,
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.080]   that to do anything in public and to say, and I admit again, I, I grew up in a family that
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.360]   anytime someone pulled out a camera, everyone put the wine glasses away. You know, like, like,
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.520]   everyone is, it was like new, we're going to like, like, official, right? He was a, well, he was,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.240]   he worked on campaigns. And so like, like, you see someone pull up a camera and suddenly all the
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.040]   glasses would just go like away, you know, and so, so I think maybe it's, for me, it seems natural
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.960]   that you would protect yourself as soon as there's something recording, but, but I,
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.400]   recording or not recording at this point, you know, everybody's got a recording device in their
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.240]   pocket and you have to be aware that you are a high level executive at the largest company in
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.720]   the world or one of the largest companies in the world, depending on the day. And, and you,
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.120]   you know, you cannot, like the, the, there was no other choice, other than to let him go in this
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.480]   environment. You know, there's just no, let me be, maybe 20 years ago or 30 years ago, it would
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:56.240]   have been fine. But, but, but, but, and they would have been warning people when he comes up to
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.800]   people with this, not in a public area, he doesn't have to. And honestly, when you go in,
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.880]   I'm a player into, in that very nice car dressed like he was dressed to the concrete,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.920]   out the other house, you're going to show off. I mean, that's the whole point of it.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:13.840]   Even if you were, even if you were just hanging out, when you go into a public area, you have to
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.800]   be aware that everyone around you can record you, you know, and, and you have to be, you know, again,
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.880]   if you weren't, if you're, you can decide that it doesn't matter for you, but if you're an executive
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.920]   at a large company that cares about their brand, it is, you know, you have to figure that out.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:34.880]   Here is so, there's Daniel, did this to Joe Biden at the Cadillac, at a Cadillac show.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:41.280]   Now Joe Biden is presumably a savvy politician, right? And he's getting ambushed by a Tiktoker.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.440]   Let's see what happens here. Hey, excuse me. Your car is awesome. What do you do for a living?
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:52.160]   Well, I'm married to Joe Biden and I make sure we make a lot more electric vehicles in America.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.680]   Oh, it's amazing. What kind of car is this? He's very political, right? He knew.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:01.680]   I bet he hit the wine glasses too, right? He did. He did. He did. The random, a random Tiktoker
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.520]   did not get to Russia to the president. Okay. Yeah, that would have been that would have been
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.640]   that's when he was president. He would have gotten halfway there and then you would have seen the
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   camera just go up. Just sloperable. I am not resisting. I am not resisting. You probably
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.800]   had a little warning there. Again, it's just if you're doing anything in the public eye at this point,
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   we should remember that we didn't have a president for four years who in public said,
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:28.960]   well, I don't want to say what he said, but we don't have enough time to show them.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.800]   I don't, you know, not to be the guy who's going to disagree, but I'm going to disagree here,
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:43.520]   which is I suspect that there are people inside Apple who either have had issues with him in the past
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:50.480]   or don't like the job he's doing or there's other and I'm saying there's not to be cynical,
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:57.600]   but like could this guy have apologized and stayed on the job, a non visible job where he's
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:03.760]   just working inside Apple on on arcane procurement stuff? And the answer is absolutely they could
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.680]   have not let him go, right? But they did. Why is that? And my guess is either there are other
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.560]   things bubbling. This is not a first strike. And I don't know anything about this. I'm just saying
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:21.280]   that or he's not somebody that like there's a power struggle or or he has job they are trying
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.080]   to groom his replacement. They don't particularly want to keep working with him. I have to ascribe
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:30.640]   some ulterior motive here because the truth is this is a big powerful corporation. He's a low
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.560]   profile executive. He made he said a dumb thing on a video and apologize for it. There wasn't a
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.760]   huge groundswell of scandal outside of Apple, even if there were people complaining about it on the
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.280]   inside. Could a giant corporation have just said he's apologized. That's enough and kept their guy
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.680]   I think on the job. Absolutely. They could have. And they said good things for Apple. He made the
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.960]   deal with global global storm most recently for the satellite thing. He he was the guy who did the
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.920]   deal with Qualcomm. In fact, he was the guy who persuaded other people not to patronize
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.400]   Qualcomm depriving them of eight billion dollars. He's made the company a lot of money. I think
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.280]   you're right though. This is by the way an article from a couple of years ago featuring the
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:20.880]   Bellevinator as Apple's cost cutter and and singing his praises. I think you might I think it has to be
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:27.360]   this is the last straw in a series of other things that Apple does not want to come out. I would
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.800]   give the other part of this is that he is in a leadership position. How does it make you feel if
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.680]   you are working under him that he said something very very sexist and offensive and that it was
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.480]   just a decision was made to well let's just let this one pass. I also acknowledge some of what Jason
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.560]   was saying. We there's a lot of this about this. We don't know it's possible that this was not
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.520]   look we were sort of tolerating a lot of stuff because of so and so but yeah clearly you are you
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.800]   cannot be taught and therefore you have to go but this is but this is it's it's a lot of this is I
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.320]   think has to be that you have to be responsive to this stuff. Can you the people who don't
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.680]   get paid the big bucks people who don't get to be get to meet with the regularly with the with
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.640]   the decision makers with the C-suite people do they get to do they get to say stuff like this and
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.920]   get away with it. No do they should they be able to respect people who are executives who are team
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:24.000]   leaders who say stuff like this. I don't I don't I don't know this I don't know him at all I don't
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.920]   know what his perspective is but the fact is this is he stepped on the rake he has to own that and
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.360]   if the response if the consequences of that is that Apple management decides that this is not
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.760]   something that we've had enough complaints about this that we don't want our our employees to be
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.160]   happy we are unhappy about this we're just going to let them go then that's that's he should have
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.920]   stepped on the rake and and and not and stepping over what he said is puts puts every sexual
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.400]   harassment yeah okay that's that Apple may be because they're dealing all corporations are
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.560]   dealing with some of them right a handful of them at any given time they're all dealing with somebody's
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.440]   upset someone said the wrong thing and Apple like not like something that's that's on a big video
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.640]   that that is out there them stepping over that would be very expensive and there's probably and I
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.560]   don't know there might there could be other things the kind of thing that if he thought that that
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.920]   was funny it's probably not the first time he said something like that in front of people
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.120]   behind door you know closed doors I mean if he thought that was funny to do in front of a camera
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.200]   who is already there probably there's probably a pattern there that yeah they're like okay we
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.800]   can't do that anymore so I think that could be the case and I again I just I'm not judging his I'm
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:38.880]   not what I want to say here is really that if he was irreplaceable and he was somebody who they
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.480]   desperately wanted to keep can't envision living without there's a playbook for that right and
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.960]   that didn't happen and and I again we could we could debate this but I'm just saying big
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:54.720]   corporations who find people valuable who behave badly do have there's a long track record of
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.640]   them finding ways they hire a crisis PR firm they do an apology or they say the the filmmaker
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.960]   behind cars like and it's dark like you know I mean they they they you know they think there's a
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.840]   problem to get back your name is gone yeah yeah so so the thing is is that he's probably very
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.200]   talented what he does he's probably gonna get snapped up by somebody else and he's probably never
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.400]   gonna do it again yeah you know and and those are the those are the things that are probably
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.040]   predictable about what's gonna happen here but but I think for apple it was not that was not
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.600]   a defensible it was it was a no brainer they had to apply a corrective action so that other leaders
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.480]   understand that look I don't care if it was innocent this is these are going to be the
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:39.040]   consequences and and it also sends a useful message that no one is irreplaceable yeah which is always
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.840]   even if he was irreplaceable that's a good message for an employer to send out right helps
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.800]   Google Google is going Google is going through as paying the price being punished as they should
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.960]   be for all the different times they had he Reuben yeah yeah for any Reuben the the godfather
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.000]   also another another researcher was the godfather of search this person basically invented
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.960]   basically turned the the an experimental search algorithm and turned it into the tool that made
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:11.840]   Google what it is today and time and time again he was being he was being totally irresponsible totally
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.920]   I'm not going to get into the details of what he was doing with his employees but they would say
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.760]   well he's too he's too important to fire he's too these two uh this is the part of oftentimes
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.520]   even with uh like I'm not thinking about Richard Stalman uh about you know notice this but this
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:33.360]   is the price of his genius is he doesn't understand these social mores and the thing is okay you can
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.480]   make that decision that this person is so important to your do your company's business that you can't
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:43.920]   afford to let him go but realize that when that truth comes out and it's going to come out you
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:49.120]   have to pay the the price of that uh the the you have to bear the scars of that with telling everyone
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.800]   of your employees that we don't really care about this that we're gonna we're gonna put off the
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.640]   for the appropriate blog post on the appropriate calendar day to celebrate the appropriate
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.000]   birth the anniversary of the appropriate thing but we don't really care about sexism in this industry
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.880]   we don't really care that people are being hired and not being promoted based on their gender
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.280]   this is the price you have to pay and so this is I hope this is an evolution that says that
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.840]   this is not an overreaction this is look we I hope this is an indication that inside of apple
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.840]   that is the attitude we don't know but I hope that this is sending a message to other
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:27.600]   people in power that look we are not going to tolerate stuff you can go yeah sorry uh storming
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:34.800]   iPhone 14 pro demands these assembler fox con set a new record revenue from cnbc fox con set
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:41.440]   september revenue was up 40 percent year on year and 83 percent higher than the august the month

[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:17.040]   nothing but it sounds like so that sounds like the iPhone 14 pros is outselling expectations
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:23.600]   perhaps yeah yeah and a pro max especially pro max yeah people people decided I'm going to
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:29.040]   spend a little more and get the better phone and smooth mass production is not uh not to be
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:35.600]   understated because these these phones are so complicated yeah and the and the and being able to
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:41.280]   you know a lot of times I think they heard that like when the first I you know the first um trackpad
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.400]   came out that was on you know that was not moving you know was the the respond the haptic response
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.040]   the loss rate was like 60 percent like you know six percent didn't make it make it out of the
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.320]   thing so so it's not so much we all get ones that mostly work um but all the mind when crashed the
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.680]   other day but your 14 pro went black like it I had to go to youtube to figure out how to turn it back
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:06.240]   on again um it was it was like it just went dead it just like it's full battery and it was like
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.320]   done and you did the wrist black and I had to hit the top button the bottom by the
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.600]   you did the reset push the thing to reset it and it came right back up again but I was
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.400]   yeah Lisa did the same thing we talked you weren't here last week but uh this is a known problem
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.680]   when you're doing the phone to phone upgrade uh I didn't do it no no I know I understand but it
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:28.880]   has happened then Lisa did the same thing she wanted youtube she didn't she didn't wake me up
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:32.000]   because it happened in the middle of the night well she did wake me up but she didn't keep me up she
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.040]   went to youtube found the solution and fixed it same thing and I suspect this is maybe a larger
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.880]   problem than just during the phone to phone upgrade because if you happen to you no I I was
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:45.920]   just literally I was using it and it just turned black which is like it was like whoa it's good to
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.920]   know that reset command I didn't know how to do the reset command I found it you know it's like
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.960]   you always have to look at it right yeah you know iPhone 4 oh yeah this is the our knowledge now
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.720]   if youtube went down I don't know what I would do right like iPhone 14 turns black and it goes
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.720]   if your iPhone 4 turns black there's the top button the bottom button and push the other the power
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.400]   button it'll come right back up and sure enough there it was yeah the uh just quickly this is this
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:14.080]   is why this is I get concerned when we think about what if apple decides to take to do away with
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:18.720]   like any kind of a standard data point port to begin with that so many recovery things you can
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.680]   do at home rely on step one plugging us plug in the usb a lightning connector into the page
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:27.280]   try that first and attach it to the papers yeah yeah but but I'm but I'm saying that there are
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.720]   recovery techniques that that both try doing this and I would hate to it's I know that you can
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.720]   always take something to an apple store but a that doesn't help me tonight at tonight in this
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:42.160]   hotel room when I'm when my my plane leaves in four hours and also some people don't have ready
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:46.400]   access to an apple store so if they were to ever decide to do away with a lightning port if they
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.960]   decide they're not going to move to usb c they would have to make sure that there are almost no
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.880]   circumstances in which if if plugging a physical copper cable goes solve the problem we have an
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:02.080]   alternative that will also get let you do the do the alks maneuver and get the black screen into
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:08.080]   a happy apple screen instead to get back to the iphone story according to nine to five
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:14.560]   mac this does make sense reviewers looking at the base model iphone 14 said it's just not good enough
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:21.520]   to spend a hundred bucks more than the 699 iphone 13 so if you want to new phone this year buy the
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:28.240]   14 pro then you're getting some uh yeah more valuable that makes it seems like a bigger
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.880]   it seems for if you're if you're an iphone like 12 pro if if you're if you're in the market for
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.600]   a pro this seems like a bigger upgrade than if you're in the market for a nothing i would
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.400]   it isn't great that we've been standardized on nothing for the basic yep the adjective lists xmen
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:47.840]   um five years ago they took the iphone line and split it in two right they did the iphone 10 and
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.560]   and they did the iphone 8 and since then we've had two different versions there's a 10s and the 10
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.280]   r and then we had the 11 and the 11 pro and we've been doing going down that road so what's interesting
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.000]   is those people with the low end phones are probably in the process of updating if they
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.800]   haven't already and i that's my question about the low end model is is it not selling as well
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.920]   because upgraders look at it and say yeah i'm good with my 10 uh 10s or whatever i don't know
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:23.760]   10 r i think that if you i think that my i have uh the 14 my wife has 13 my kids have the 12
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:32.320]   and i think that the if you have the 12 pro i don't like even then i i wouldn't recommend
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.000]   upgrading you know between you know like i think that the problem is is that the lower end ones
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.520]   just aren't moving very fast from those other ones so but but i want dynamic island daddy
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:48.080]   right i just don't think i don't even care so i think that the pro the pro is being bought by
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.840]   the people like us that just buy something every you know like oh i want the new one no i was a 12
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.640]   pro max guy upgrading to the 14 i would agree with you by the way it probably doesn't make a huge
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.800]   difference it's the camera but i kind of like the dynamic island i like i like i have to admit i
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:09.520]   grow to like it i think the number one feature uh for me of the new iphone is this great lock screen
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:16.000]   but i would have gotten that wouldn't i on uh the 16 so i mean i love the i have a slideshow of my
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:23.760]   wife i showed her how to do it she's got her cats not me uh but it's a that's the new lock screen is
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.200]   a that's a nice feature but i would have gotten that in the 12 the cameras incremental improvement
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:34.880]   dynamic island again you're you're playing back to the it's not like the the lower end one is really
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.920]   not too it's it's the people who have sixes and eights and that's easy stuff like when are they
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.600]   gonna get a new one and you want to have something that's new and modern for them to go to that's
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.000]   different than what it was last year but but it's so they're jumping in somewhere in that in that
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.320]   ecosystem but i think that the the yeah the real growth is which is hard because everyone argues
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.640]   that apple should make a cheaper one but the ones that are selling are the like the eight people
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:03.600]   does make a cheaper ones the 13 they do yeah yeah that's really how it works right um there was a
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:09.440]   very big interview uh in a japanese web magazine called axis which i couldn't read so thank you at
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:15.360]   nine to five mac for translating it they talked to allen die who's the vp of human interface
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:22.240]   design and craig federiygi about the dynamic island die said the company been planning for years
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.600]   uh to do this and and as i expected he said that it's difficult to trace a source of
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:36.560]   ideas because we discuss it a lot but the whole issue was you know what if the sensor area on the
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:43.120]   screen could be made smaller what could you do with the surplus space he says if you think about it
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.720]   this status bar is small right but it plays a role in providing important information that users
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.240]   always use it's an area where our hard work put into a round of few pixels has a very big effect
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.880]   so there was a story about doing something more special in this area anyway they're saying what
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:07.120]   can we do uh with this uh and and how long comes uh dynamic island he says it's as big a change
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:13.760]   to ios as federiygi does as uh put it as when we left boss lost the home button and had to replace
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.600]   it uh with a face id it's a massive potential change potentially apple apple actually released
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.640]   developer guidelines for how to use the dynamic island just last week i think like an official
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.960]   doc so uh i was i was i was wondering if i was always wondering if apple intended the dynamic
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:37.600]   the dynamic island to be exploited directly only by apple's own apis uh excuse me like so that
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.880]   be so that like uh just like the the the podcast app that i use that has not had not been updated
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:48.160]   for the dynamic island it got the dynamic island for free because it was using the standard playback
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.280]   playback media apis so i was wondering if if apple would simply would also allow you to simply say
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.480]   you know what if you've got a fresh idea for how to use this we are gonna let you use the animation
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.680]   we're gonna let you put your own control surfaces uh to the left and to the right of that island
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.640]   and we're gonna let you create your own little pop-outs because i think that that's exciting in the
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:15.920]   way that the touch bar never ever ever was uh and i'm super i'm i i it's it's it's still two or three
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.080]   weeks later and i'm still really excited about what can be done with this as a user interface
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:25.840]   element because it's just such an such a wonderful thing packed with possibilities this video from
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:33.840]   axis shows the 14 different distinct animations available uh to to and that's and that's just by
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.840]   the way uh what apple's doing and of course apps can also use dynamic island so uh yeah i'm i'm
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:45.440]   i'm x i like it i really do like it i mean it's taking a negative and making a positive i
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.120]   it's not a gimmick now that i've been using it for about a week like it's it's not a gimmick
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:54.320]   it's it's quickly becomes natural to expect that oh oh god i hate this song let's just tap the dynamic
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:00.160]   island to just to figure out what's going on yeah yeah yeah well done yeah i think uh talking about
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:06.560]   years of in the making i get the feeling i mean my my vibe on this is that the notch with the
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.440]   iphone 10 when that shipped they were there was very much a what's next kind of moment and then
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.080]   they've spent the last five years sort of yeah wondering what is our next step beyond the notch
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.960]   because the notch is a blank area right and that's just how we've all lived over the last five years
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.320]   but it was five years ago so they've had time to ponder their next move and when they unveiled
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.800]   this i definitely felt like they've been working on this for five years right they've been thinking
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:35.280]   about what goes in a smaller cutout area so that they can make it because you know that notch had
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.600]   to kill them right those designers like there's just blank space with nothing it's not addressable
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:44.080]   at all and they probably started to say well what if we made it smaller and we could draw things
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.120]   around it and then you know it cascaded from there into something i think very clever and
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:57.280]   potentially quite useful i might know why tony blevin's got fired actually uh you may remember i don't
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:04.240]   think we reported it but t smc had told apple uh we are going to raise the price for our chips the
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:12.480]   three nanometer chips uh between uh three and five percent and the eight inch wafer output
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:20.400]   prices by six percent and the story was last week apple said no the story is this week t smc has won
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:27.120]   uh this is from toms uh hardware reports published by tylons business-orientated
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.600]   mediating indicate that apple has yielded to t smc's price increase demands for next year
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:39.280]   now of course both these are rumors uh so we don't we don't really know what's happening inside but
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.560]   the economic daily said that here several t smc customers had received notices of the price
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:50.240]   increase but apple indicated it would reject any increases within video watching closely
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:59.440]   to see what happened today the same source says apple will pay the requested extra money for t smc's
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.920]   services t smc is the taiwan semi conductor uh manufacturing company is really in the driver's
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:10.560]   seat they're the only ones with this process a process admittedly funded by apple over the years
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.400]   in effect but uh they've got the monopoly on it apple wants those three nanometer chips what are
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.360]   you gonna do of course on the other hand apples their biggest customer i'm sure by far
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:28.640]   uh so it's a dance once you and i think i wonder if exclusivity of the manufacturing process is
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.400]   starting to there's a there's going to be sun setting on some technology that they could then
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.560]   offer to everybody else and that's another good reason to stay in good graces make sure this
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.960]   relationship is still working maybe they were able to get some concessions from t smc like
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.840]   yeah we'll only sell it to you for the next three years which would be a good concession right
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:54.320]   uh all right i think how much is go ahead i was gonna i was gonna say i'm reminding myself
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.760]   that this is based this is not based on direct knowledge in this this source this is source so
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.640]   that you can you do have to take this with a grain of salt right uh but so i was about to correct
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:09.920]   myself and basically say that this say something snarky along the lines of well see how far willing
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.720]   apple is willing to negotiate and concede when you actually when they apple can actually considers
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:19.920]   you to be indispensable if they've ever had a developer that they consider to be indispensable
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:25.280]   yeah maybe they would decide to to to to double check some of these ashore policies to decide if
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.960]   that was really what they needed to do do moving forward yeah i forgot to give you this story uh
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:37.280]   apple has published guidelines for activities in the iphone 14 pros dynamic island so they have now
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:45.600]   official guidelines for third parties uh that uh developers can read uh on best practices
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:52.320]   um so that might be of of some interest to developers although i you know how developers are they may
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:59.440]   well especially like that tomsen guy he might uh yeah he might trouble i have trouble i have trouble
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.960]   during my during my brief i asked them directly about about the having kitty cats on top of the
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.240]   dynamic island but they say and also and also about third party stuff and they said that we we are
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:16.400]   aware of this uh and uh and essentially that at least for the time being they are willing they're
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.520]   kind of eager to just sit back and see how people how developers decide to use the dynamic island
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.560]   before inflicting a whole bunch of rules on what they can't do with it so maybe next maybe next
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.400]   year wwdc we will see a new guideline saying okay you you have the following three developers to
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:38.400]   thank for these following nine pages of of no you can't do that anymore on this on this thing but yeah
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.680]   i i which which was a very very positive thing again opening it up to third party in sanity is
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.320]   is a very very positive thing for this feature pictures have come through from tim and eddie's
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:54.560]   excellent vacation uh they were in europe and apparently went to october fest that's a large
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:44:01.200]   large stein oh yeah of delicious beer it looks like uh tim and eddie got the jackets too i don't
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.760]   see the lateros eddie's eddie is wearing later host and tim is wearing khakis because he's a

[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:31.040]   apple executives appear and they rotated in and out photos yeah it was very strange okay so jony
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.960]   frugie yeah jony frugie yeah is it the anechoic chamber there so jony frugie the chip guy obviously
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.560]   either was part of the trip or they flew him in for the one and then the piece of resistance is the
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:50.000]   tedd lasso phone oh my god eddy q full energy commit to the his orange apple watch ultra band yeah
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000]   and an anawatting him they have the exact same energy there too oh yeah if you want okay i
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.840]   are feeling it everybody else is sort of play acting you know actually nothing was going on in
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.880]   the field it was completely empty and so i guess the photographer said so okay pretend richman just
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:09.040]   scored an amazing goal yep and uh you could tell that the professional actors are except
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.720]   except for eddy q except for eddy i want now i want you to imagine that jason sudeka's finally
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.120]   stopped bulking at the season three changes and is finally accepted the scripts and you can actually
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:26.880]   go to production and he's right the sports fans so he gets it yeah yeah i mean alex is right this is
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:31.920]   obviously like set up you know this is obviously well choreographed but i can't you know i kind of
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.160]   get the impression that tim is having a good time and he's actually enjoying i think he enjoyed this
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.000]   all these little special things it's like and it does look like the greatest season of the amazing
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   race ever uh-huh first go to go to the fad again will you will meet a man dressed as the pope
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.960]   make sure you put these eight these stations of the cross in the right order he will then give you
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:58.400]   your next clue tim and eddy you must choose meet the pope or honorary degree you know i mean honestly
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:04.960]   both that from tim's point of view this was it's like being a head of state or or royal is he gets
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:10.560]   into a plane somebody says okay get into this car okay here's here's a briefing paper on where
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:17.040]   we're going okay post photos okay get back in the car rarely even that i mean the this is this is
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.520]   the executive assistance the ea's run everything you know like they're just you sit in these meetings
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:26.720]   i don't know what apple but i've worked with other ones that are similar companies and you know you
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.440]   just have all these meetings with the ea's the the the the executive assistant who could be a se the
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:37.440]   ea's for these these folks could be a ceo at most most smaller companies i mean they're very on top of
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.600]   it and they're and they're managing all the security they're managing all of the so they're
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.760]   they they manage all of that and a lot of times the ceo they they get kind of an idea oh i i think
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.800]   that'd be good that'd be good that'd be good and they say you know they they kind of talked to them
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.480]   a little bit about it but there's not a lot of detail then they just show up and they just people
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:55.760]   just drive them around and they go there on the way there they go this is what you're going to do
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.480]   and but there's it's sometimes it's other than a couple high points that they requested
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.080]   almost everything else is they're just showing up and being themselves and there someone tells them
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:08.080]   where points them in the right direction and yeah just so many so many moving parts and they're so
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.000]   busy working on other things like they're still having negotiations about the chip price right
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000]   right thing else yeah so so it's a series of photo ops separated by intermittable drives and flights
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.440]   and and there's like a half an hour to figure out the like it there's like i mean there's
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.760]   meetings and meetings and meetings and then before they come in i mean i've done some of the photos
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:29.840]   for so i'm sure there was a mark on the floor and there's like a whole set up in there go yeah
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.880]   yeah there's a whole setup and there's a whole process and we're gonna have a cover here and then
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.680]   we make sure the lighting's right and you know all the other bits and pieces when they show up
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.000]   it works yeah yeah one of the most one of those precious and valuable and limited commodities at
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.680]   any corporation is the time of the CEO so even so even though even though like it's it seems
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:49.520]   seems like a bit of it's it's fun dialing when visit the fed we're gonna get this great photo up
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.680]   someone has decided that okay the the time is going to take to get him out there to get him to
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:58.400]   decide to arrange this to get the photo is more valuable the time he could be speaking could be
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.720]   spending on a very private business sort of audience with people you've never heard of at a company
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.280]   you've never heard of that nonetheless is absolutely essential to getting a certain component of a
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:12.640]   VR headset ready in five years so my question is in the SUVs on the way there you know like it's
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:18.080]   you know it's so my question is were all of these people on this roof and there was a place a hole
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:23.040]   in the middle for Tim and then did they drop him down via helicopter how did he actually get
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:30.080]   bottom like Michael Jackson was great though i would take pictures of it but
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:32.560]   you definitely came in from a helicopter
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:40.000]   imagine the fight i've been in group photos i don't know art and i'm not nearly as as exciting as this
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]   and even when it's like oh here's the here's the the mayor of Dublin that we're having a a
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.080]   picture taken with the number of people who are like i'm just gonna make sure that i'm kind of
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.720]   close to him without making it look that i'm too close to him so i wonder if every single spot on
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:58.320]   this photo was saying no you are sitting number four from the left of this person sure and i feel
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:05.040]   bad for this guy the only thing you can see is his bad hairdo so he kind of got a loss down i uh i
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.080]   and there's nobody's eyes are closed or anything having tried to take company
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:14.400]   well as your christmas card they really did this uh do you think they took a hundred
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.080]   shots i usually do like if i take those kind of photos i just hold the button down and go
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:21.840]   whoo you know just take a whole bunch of and then you a little bit of photoshop work and you can
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:26.000]   clean that all up you know and so yeah we've done that we've dropped people in taking people out
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.400]   that kind of and if you do it if you do a maulin success like in that fast you know um grab a whole
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.840]   bunch of images a lot of times that they've barely moved and so it's not very hard for the
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.680]   lighting and everything else to blend it back in right i wonder would it be great i'll start
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.840]   go ahead but but i was just i was just thinking to myself would it be great if like we will
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.640]   find out like next year at an iphone launcher a year after that that they were actually dog
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.920]   fooding like an iphone feature like yeah special that's that that makes sure that every but that
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.560]   will combine eight to eighteen different photos looking for individual elements in which everybody's
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.480]   looking at the camera this one's fun this is uh where's walled oh see if you can find tim cook
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   in this picture yeah you know i think they had a special look he liked just just for tim just to
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:10.560]   shine him oh no that that's that's that's just his aura that's just his
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:16.720]   there's a little i don't know where they are there's a lot of people in that picture oh here's a
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:21.040]   guy pretending to take in the future here's a guy pretending is take a selfie with his uh can we
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:30.000]   get this guy an iphone 14 please this is uh with his product red iphone 14 and notice how high that
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.800]   camera is if if i took that photo i would probably i'm just saying if it was me not that i've ever
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:39.040]   done this before i'd probably get on a ladder yeah so i there's a little you get a little like a
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:43.200]   little for shoot shoot that ladder yeah and then you can you get the photographer up there and they
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.040]   and they take it and they set it all up and then they yeah but don't don't look at the camera don't
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.680]   look at the camera look at the phone look at the camera look at the phone oh i'm sure i'm sure that
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:55.040]   was i'm sure that was on site that wasn't that was just another shot that actually looked better
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:01.760]   uh because again the number the the the amount of effort that is taken to make make it look like
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:07.120]   there's no effort taken whatsoever exactly yeah is gigawattie technology yeah precisely
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:10.640]   wait a minute wait a minute when snuck in here what the hell's he looking at
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.440]   then but then there's the unplanned guy that just sitting in the background like hey yeah can we get
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:25.520]   done who is this guy in this picture so many so many pictures are going to be cropped in
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:34.000]   so many interesting ways on people's instagram me and tim me and tim this is fun tim cook's excellent

[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.320]   most of apple's executive team doing this so it is you talk about the time of uh the the
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.560]   ceo being valuable yeah basically the executive team it looks like they basically marked the week
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.800]   off after the iphone launch was done they marked a week off and said we're going to europe
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.520]   everybody yeah well and it's good and and and it probably was some meetings in them hanging out
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.200]   with some of the employees separate airplanes that are outside of separate airplanes don't
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:09.280]   want to be in the same airplane most likely not they wouldn't they wouldn't all fit in a g6 anyway
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:17.200]   all right let's take a break we've enjoyed the photos from tim cook's excellent adventure in

[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.400]   what you do when you're pope and so yeah you can be ahead it's not just not just heads of state that
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:15.360]   frances specifically meets with apple spent a lot of money a lot of money on emancipation
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.120]   uh about a fellow who's escaped slavery and is on the run to try to turn to his family it's a
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:26.960]   period piece december second it debuts an apple tv i'm sorry December ninth and apple tv plus
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:34.480]   it features though star is will smith no you have to remember that this spring when this when
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:39.360]   it was in post it was they've already shot it they've already spent all the money
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:42.720]   on it so it's not like they said oh we're gonna go ahead and shoot this film anyway they they
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:46.800]   already put whatever if it was if it were Warner brothers they probably have killed the film but
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:54.160]   they spent a lot of money on it and uh it's a famous director famous star uh you can't it will be
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:58.880]   interesting though to see if because of course will smith has not found work uh since the slap
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:02.720]   the oscar slap i think it's gonna kill ticket sales i mean ticket sales at theaters are gonna be
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.200]   really low oh wait it doesn't matter they are releasing it to theaters but that's purely
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.600]   performance so they can get an oscar yeah oh i hope will smith gets nominated for an oscar that
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.000]   would be a staracle he can't go he'd have to send sachine little feather oh no she's
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.880]   bance japan she's also a little more she was living in navato i didn't realize that she was local we
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:26.080]   should have had her in i know we should have we should i just i want to say her a her a bit it was
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.080]   it was she she passed away in navato i was like she's right here i didn't know
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.880]   we should take this opportunity to mention that mac break weekly is produced on the hereditary

[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.960]   seriously i i've been thinking i should mention that from time to time uh i've there's there's a
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:52.880]   really nice uh placard like about 50 yards away from here that says here's like this is this land

[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:09.040]   that this was basically a thriving seaside community yes with
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.640]   for a long long time before white people came in and decided to give it clever names and put up
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:20.240]   frozen ice cream stands frozen the the name of the our town is coast me walk actually i you know
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:26.240]   so funny because when we first moved here it said no one knows what the meaning of pediluma is
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.000]   and then somebody said well actually yes i want to know we do know because we gave it the name
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:39.120]   thank you very much um it's uh it means flat back they think it refers to the sonoma mountain with

[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:24.560]   so i tried to serve it from a website that failed instantly just right away so then we were actually
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:28.560]   i don't know if you remember in the early days we were trying to get people to seed the bit torrent
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.600]   feeds and stuff i mean it just was really nightmare that's when matt levine from cash fly called

[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:06.640]   cash fly at cac he f l y dot com thank you cash fly uh jason snell do you have a pick of the week
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:13.600]   for us i i do it is a really really simple one it is a free apple watch app believe it or not i'll
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:19.920]   take it from from kraig hawkin berry and i can factor even better this is literally a guy who's
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.160]   a software developer wondering why can't my apple watch do this and realizing maybe he could make
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:33.920]   that happen so it's called now playing plus and all it does is provide uh corner and circular
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:40.160]   complications for your apple watch faces that when you tap on them it will open the now playing
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.440]   window which means it's the audio of whatever app is currently playing so you can do like the music
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:51.520]   complication but it will open the music app and this opens the now playing view so you can very
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:56.960]   quickly just tap hello your controls whether it's a podcast player or an audio player or music
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:02.080]   player or something else and then make the changes and he literally made it because he wanted it
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:06.480]   for himself and then thought other people could use it too and since apple doesn't provide a now
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:12.960]   playing a complication in those shapes he made it and it's free and it's open source and it's on
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:17.040]   the app store yeah but like i have the apple music complication and it's terrible
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:22.720]   so and it's just apple music so this would be would just pull up whatever's playing right now
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.640]   yeah whatever is currently playing and again it's it's not it's very simple and it's free and you know
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:32.960]   it's limited by the watch o s quirks but it gives if what you want like i listened to a lot of podcasts
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.840]   on my apple watch and so having that control there and having it be right available where i can
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:44.080]   tap it and and then if i am listening to music the same tap will open the now playing showing where
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:48.880]   the music is playing so so it's now on my apple watch because i downloaded it from the app store
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:54.240]   and now all i have to it's free by the way now all i have to do is edit and make it a complication
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:59.520]   right i have to deal with that complexity but at least i have so many complications because i'm
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:06.720]   using that new uh ultra uh watch face the what is it i can't remember but uh i have one two three
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.120]   four five six seven eight complications it's the most it's the most of any
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:16.960]   but i still don't know which one i'm gonna get rid of it's so complicated i think you now have to
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:22.800]   actually call that not a watch face but a launcher you know honestly that's the best thing about the
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.160]   ultra it isn't a watch it's like a mini phone on your on your wrist this thing is awesome i just
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:35.200]   love my uh my ultra so off i have downloaded it thank you kraig i just have to decide yeah maybe
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.480]   well i have reminders maybe i'll replace drafts i don't i hardly ever use drafts anymore i'll replace
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:48.320]   that one mr uh Andy and i co your pick of the week uh my pick of the week is actually a long
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.760]   old a book series that people have been recommending to me people i really really trust and respect
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.600]   and i've never gotten around to reading it it's the fledged series of mysteries of mystery oh yeah the
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:03.760]   new movie just came up yeah yeah and so it's causing a lot of people to talk about it and again everyone
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.920]   i've i've told i've talked everyone who's who's recommended this to me it's never a halfway
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.040]   recommendation it's always oh my god you've got to try again i can't believe you've never seen
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:16.880]   this before so i'm on to buying like the first book and i'll say that the first two pages
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:22.720]   i'll okay let me let me tell you this uh i will say to quickly to quickly answer it's so good that i
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.800]   was halfway through it i already bought the second and the third cenu i wanted to continue to read it
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:35.760]   however the first two pages are the most inscrutable mess i have ever seen in my life i'm not and you're
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:42.240]   gonna think i'm joking but i am i after rereading the first two pages over and over again i'm not
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:47.360]   joking i thought that did something did this file get corrupted on the way to my temple because
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:53.120]   it's like okay so they're on a beach no they're not on the beach they're on a carpeted surface
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:59.680]   and that no but what and so after i after i pushed i heroically pushed through the first two pages
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:04.960]   it it settled down also the first book has the problem of not problem but maybe the quirk of
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:12.160]   when you see somebody who has written the first novel and you're i'm really keen to see in the
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:16.000]   second and the third and the fourth or like ten eleven the books in the series how he settles down
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.360]   because the the titular character is a is a newspaper reporter back when you realize that you
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:27.440]   realize that the reason why so many like central characters and comics and tv and and and novels
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:32.400]   are like newspaper reports because back in like the 70s and earlier they're the only people who had
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.320]   access to quote the internet unquote they're the only person who can say i need to know about this
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.720]   business person i'll call the business department i need to know if i need to have a photo of this
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.120]   person so i know that this if this person who claimed to be this person is i'll i'll contact the photo
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:49.840]   more for for pictures uh so but the the the other the other thing that might throw you like off the
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.560]   first one is that the pre the people that fletch talks to as reporter and also just as you know
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:00.560]   what he's doing they like to talk a lot where like hi i i'm purporting to be an insurance
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:05.520]   investigator even though i've shown you no reason to believe i'm one what is is this person is this
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:10.560]   person healthy oh boy well let me tell you about i've been i've been their family doctor for for
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:15.440]   two generations now and the thing is he flies those airplanes and his father isn't very happy about
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:20.160]   that that's why they have this is like wow that is much more than i get when i call somebody saying
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.080]   hi i've actually investigated a story can you tell me something very very simple about something
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:29.360]   you've already made public so so it's but it's really really good i've actually stopped like
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:34.160]   right at the point where they're about to i'm about to find out like what actually what the
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:38.080]   solution of the mystery is because it's it's enough stuff that i want to figure out like okay what
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.240]   have i seen what have they told me and what can i figure out oh it's just like that too it's like
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:47.680]   yeah it's like so easy a brown adventure well not not just not just that but it was like it was
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:52.080]   also a very very entertaining read he built it that these were written like in the 70s so
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:56.320]   it is of course very very 70s and what it's all about so it's a very very interesting world
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:01.840]   the very very way they put it together Lisa she said that uh uh the new
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:07.840]   fletch movie confess fletch which has john ham in it is is not only very good because remember it was
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:13.600]   a chevy chase yeah a couple of years ago it's not only very good but very true to the book she said
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.480]   because her husband loves the book so yeah foundation from schmies and and i have to admit that's what
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.880]   threw me despite all the recommendations because i did see the chevy chase movie so i so i not only
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:28.080]   associate with chevy chase by that associate with i associate with a chevy chase movie and all
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.000]   the things that chevy chase wants to put in there not associating it with that apparently yeah so so
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.880]   so so so not just not just the books if you're also uh an audible dot com member they have made
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:41.440]   like all the books in the series all the audiobooks free oh for members they have just click and download
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.680]   it's an original oh oh i just see that all of them are just play yeah you just you just click add to
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.480]   cart and i don't know i don't know if they stay excuse me excuse me add to library so they are yeah
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:56.640]   you can listen to them all free i don't know if you get to keep them after like the promotion for
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.280]   this movie is over with but that's that's that's gonna be pretty good but like i said i bought a
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.240]   person to listen to all of them they're sure yeah and that's that's that's another great thing about
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:11.120]   great mis excuse me what i like about certain mystery series where i wrote i read most of it in
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:15.920]   one evening yeah and i could have finished it that night it had an i said oh let's let's stop here let's
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:22.160]   say this as a treat and then get the payoff later on for some reason two of the eleven have the new
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:31.440]   audible category cozy well amateurs lose crimes there's incosy this is new audibles i'm putting cozy
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.520]   next to books for some reason i don't like doesn't say what it is but it means that we're now entering
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:40.960]   the winter and you can be under a blanket and it's cozy and it'll be cozy it's a good book to
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:45.920]   read for that i have to say that i was we saw the trailer and then i felt like i wanted to watch a
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:51.600]   little bit of the of the original fledge so i watched we were watching a little bit of it and um and
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.400]   i was like oh i don't know looking at the trailer i don't know if the new one will be as good as the
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:01.360]   as the chevy chase one and my wife who i just never expected this said well the chevy chase
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:08.400]   one's nowhere near the books and i was like you read fledges like the chevy chase one they're just
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:13.360]   not even close you know like to you know it's such a good book and then she just walked off and i was
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:20.000]   kind of after 20 years i was still but what else do what else do i know about you if that is really
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.440]   really your real name comment it's like it's not even close let me do it okay so it sounds like avoid
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:31.600]   the chevy chase versions yes i would read the books and then watch the john ham version sounds
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:35.840]   like that's the that's the order of operations and by the way again free unaudible if you're an
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:41.360]   audible subscriber right now so that's a nice opportunity your pick of the week Alex Lindsay
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:47.040]   so my pick of the week is again from my industry qlab and and we had a great hour with them last
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:53.200]   week on office hours last friday and um you know qlab is has been around i didn't so i only knew
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.000]   about qlab for about the last 10 years so i was in i was actually in africa and they were running
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.680]   all the lights and the playback and everything else with this little app that i had never seen
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:08.880]   before and um and it was it's all it's mac based um and it is what it does is it's it runs cues and
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.520]   so these cues are you basically set up all these cues that you want to go and you want to have the
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.080]   lights do this and i want and it's really used for theater this is a this is a theater app although
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:23.120]   uh a bunch of us use it for other things when we're doing productions and so on so forth but
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.360]   what it does is it keep track of all these cues i want the volume to go here i want the speakers
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.720]   these speakers to do this but those lights do that and i want the video to play out from
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:34.960]   six different screens you know with different videos and so if you're doing these kind of
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:41.280]   uh very technologically driven or even sometimes simple ones you can have all these cues and you
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:45.520]   can go go go go go and it's going to start it's going to start building out this um
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.360]   uh this entire piece that supports all the actors that are on the stage um we use them for presentations
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.120]   you can have uh you know a lot of different bits and pieces anyway so they they've we've been using
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:01.200]   it now for years um and you know again i have not seen another app that's quite like it and um
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.720]   and so it's it's just a really great one and it's very mac mac based and so it's it um it just
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:12.160]   feels like a mac app and um but it does incredible it can coordinate all of your lights and your
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:17.920]   audio and your video and send out other cues and and get cues back and and so on so forth
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.640]   um the big update for five oh it just came out and again that's why they came onto our show
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:27.520]   is that you know they've rewritten it for metal and i think the first 20 minutes of the show is
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.640]   talking about how when they rewrote it they just couldn't believe how many video outputs they were
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.600]   getting you know tenety-pee video outputs coming out of a mac mini you know or a laptop it's just
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:43.120]   it's just so they've rewritten it from the ground up for that video engine to do um you know to
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.880]   really take full advantage of it and we're really moving towards you know used to be that you really
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.800]   worried about how much processor power you had especially for a theater because it has to work
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.520]   every single time it can't lose frames it can't drop things out it can't crash and so that's what
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.160]   they they've been really writing towards and so having the metal the big the metal is the big update
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:06.560]   for it um it also has blending modes now ndi so that you can send it out over uh through software um a
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.600]   lot of new collaboration tools new patching tools and audio but overall it's just an excuse to talk
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.600]   about a great mac app from a company from some folks that have been doing this now i guess for
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:21.120]   uh i think uh you know almost 20 years you know have they been building this this app up and
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:25.120]   and it was a great conversation that we had with them last week and and it's uh um it's a really
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.680]   really good app if you're looking for how to coordinate an event so it doesn't have to be a play it can
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:33.280]   be your next corporate event or or the things you might want to take a look at this they have
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.920]   lots of different pricing options they got a free version that will do a handful of things
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:42.240]   you can you say oh i only want to control video there's a version for that that's not as expensive
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.240]   i only do audio or i only want to do the lights you can do all of those things you can rent it by
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:50.800]   the day you know or the month if you only think you're going to use it for this one show and so
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:54.400]   they've they've really you know worked that out and they really spend a lot of time in customer
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:58.960]   service and really making sure that people are getting what they need um you know out of it and
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:05.120]   it's just a it's just such a cool app you know so um anyway i just it's it's on the update it's
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:09.440]   worth talking about again i think i've recommended it once or twice before um but it's a it's a really
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.560]   really good app for coordinating events um and again it's not just that it plays when you hit play
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.160]   you hit play and you can have a whole slew of things that all happen at that same time these
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:21.200]   lights are going to do this and there's going to play six videos across these and the audio is going
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.200]   to come up and there's going to be three effects that happen over here and this little thing's
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.560]   going to spin and all those things can be controlled by just hitting one button
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:34.400]   and that's what you have to do for these theatrical events i confessed i choked when i saw the you
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:41.440]   know the the prices but the free for a community theater or school is does everything probably
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:47.440]   most people would want to do so good on them for you know offering a very high quality demo of
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.360]   right yeah the twelve the twelve hundred dollar version is like all the things that you would want
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.640]   permanently not rented right but a lot of times people need some subsets or even just to start
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.960]   with something right and you could rent it for twelve bucks a day if you have a yeah it's a short
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:06.880]   little show but i think you know you should certainly look at the features in the free version qlab qlab
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:16.320]   dot app on the way of qlab 5 now out we find out about these things through this guy's amazing
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:24.960]   24 hour production called office hours dot global the office hours go on all day and all night but
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:30.720]   Alex is there in the morning um i want to watch today's show i missed it focus on voice over
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:36.000]   great yeah smokes yeah we have we have we have we have uh i've you know of course i it took me too
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.520]   long to hand off the second so we have so what happens in office hours is there's the first hour
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.920]   it's just general discussion and whatever questions people bring in every morning and then the second
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.880]   hour is usually something you know we want to spend a little more time on we're going to bring some
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:52.800]   folks in where either like qlab was on last friday but to but what i did is over i fired myself i
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:57.360]   would i used to manage all of these second hours and i was like i was not doing it very well and i
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:02.320]   was like okay i'm gonna hand it off so i handed it off to josh koffman and and he built councils
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:06.160]   for each day and then he then they're figuring all the stuff out and it took a little while to get
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.720]   it all worked out but it's starting to bear fruit and and he he put together such a great second
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:16.000]   hours it's uh four different people who are doing voiceovers in different ways they're doing audiobooks
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.560]   they're doing um you know generals so they're building some of them are working on building other
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:26.480]   people's audio booths and so on so forth and and then there was half people that are regulars on
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:31.920]   art about you know like half of our half of our group have done voiceovers at some point so it was
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:39.120]   a real really interesting conversation about uh about voice about voiceovers and what the business
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:43.760]   and the process and how people approach it and again mostly we don't it's not a seminar it's
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:48.320]   we talked for you know we everybody introduces themselves in the first you know five to eight
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:52.960]   minutes and then it's just open q&a with people asking questions about voiceovers and everyone's
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.640]   just answering them this really is really really great i got out of it i was like well that's one
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.680]   of our best second hours ever i can't wait to see it i want to see the episode from last week on the
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:08.880]   video production of qe to's funeral i mean imagine that and uh yeah begin to end all of the work that
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.000]   went into that just fascinating stuff office hours dot global you could join the zoom call there's a
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.800]   uh formed fill out on the on the page or and that of course is going on all the time

[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.680]   that's great it's it's really dense it's really a way to make any money on this or is it's just all
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:46.080]   out of pocket so far it's been out of pocket i enjoy it i mean i i have a it benefits you because
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:51.440]   you you get people know about 090 and and you know absolutely and we've definitely and the big thing
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:56.320]   is for me it's i i learn a lot and so i learn a lot every i learned something every day like oh
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.320]   that's something new and so it's it's a good way for me to stay up on all the things that are moving
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:06.720]   around i also i often need to hire people so i mean i hire more and more people every day from the
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.120]   or organize it you know like for me the hard part is as you talked about earlier was a recruiter
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:15.680]   it's just finding good people and for me with office hours especially if they join the panel or
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:20.800]   if they're involved in the program i get this massive pool all over the world like hey we we
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:27.520]   almost had to put somebody in london with a a-level actress and and uh i you know normally that would
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.480]   be very stressful and i was like oh i i just know this you know can do that so so it's so you know
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.920]   you have people all over the world that i can send a really great camera and someone that's
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:40.720]   going to be appropriate and you know all that stuff is that's really valuable yeah i said somebody
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:45.680]   there this weekend on the radio show he he has a player piano and he does youtube videos and he
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:51.040]   wanted a better way to audio interface he's been and so i said you know the best place to ask that
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:55.360]   question yeah two states two days or two days i guess that's where our our audio folks all come in on
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:01.920]   two states yeah thank you Alex for being here we appreciate it if you want to hire Alex 090.media
