[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.940]   Alia, how are you doing? Good to see you. You had should be big
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.700]   You have the new Macbook Pro and we're gonna talk about the second. You also have them here. You have all three of them. Wow
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.060]   So many it's good lifting Leo's it's health conscious

[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.500]   Yes, and I am working on your beard as a matter of fact. I realize now my beard is going to look exactly like your beard
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.020]   We have the same for a young guy. You're awfully great. We have the same hair color and beard. I went gray in high school Wow
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.140]   Wow, I like it
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.100]   Andy and I co who is never going to go great wait a minute. No, no, that's just a little gray there too
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.980]   It's no no there's there. Oh, there's plenty
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.740]   It's it's funny when I go through like the the timeline of now that you have like all the photos online of like all the
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.820]   Things been taken for the past 10 years. It's like my my old age is like it's like a progress bar loading in you can see
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.980]   Where it's like from like eight years ago. This is all like red or a copper, but you see it like just a little bit
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.300]   It's almost there and like father time is not like jiggling the mouse with his sight saying oh man
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.380]   It's been stuck on that forever. So you're in a hotel room
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.980]   Trouble with the plumbing or are you traveling?
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.620]   No, I had to go on the lamb. No, I'm I'm in Los Angeles as a matter of fact
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.340]   For the Mac Tech Conference. Oh nice and the LA car show while you're there
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.300]   Maybe if I have a little bit of time
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.220]   I'm doing I got a it's the great thing about LA is that you feel as though I spent eight hours on a damn plane
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.740]   I'm not gonna just zip in and zip up here for a couple days. I'm staying for the day. Yeah, LA's great
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.260]   Yeah, Andy writes for the Chicago excuse me Chicago Sun times
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.220]   not trunk
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.220]   the not trunk of Chicago and
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.340]   joins us as does Renee every week to talk about
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.180]   Macintosh I'm not I'm not doing you to service to say that you don't have a MacBook Pro, right? I mean you don't have a MacBook Pro
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.620]   No, no, no, okay, so we will we will defer here to mr. Richie. They've taken my money. That's the good side
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.380]   First to come for your money
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.060]   So we ordered two we ordered a 13 in silver and a 15 in space gram liking that space gray
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.500]   I think that looks pretty good
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.980]   But the real question everybody has and there's lots of to talk about the new trackpad the p3 screen
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.340]   But the real question everybody has is the touch bar
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.900]   Is it a gimmick?
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.060]   Does it you know my my concern about and join us during kind of echo this at her review in the Wall Street Journal this morning
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.500]   Is that it is not something we're trained to use there's no tactile feedback
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.500]   It's you if you're a touch type is you still have to look down at the touch party use it because it changes all the time
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.180]   And I'm concerned that I may just end up not using it
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.900]   But Renee you've had it for how long have you had it for?
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.380]   I've had one with the touch bar for a week and a half now in the 15 inch for about four or five days
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.140]   Okay
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.820]   We can a half then oh and the other thing and I know Andy will want to know about this
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.260]   But we won't get into it until we do the touch bar is the new keyboard
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.620]   But how how is that touch bar work gimmick or not?
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940]   So I have mixed feelings about the touch bar and a week and a half
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.580]   I've gotten to use it a lot more it's the problem with the touch bar is that not every mac has it
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.500]   Which means it can't make anything that's dependent on it and when something's not dependent on it
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.740]   You're not forced to use it and then it you know
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.940]   There's even odds you'll never make it a habit and it really is like 3d touch
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.660]   I use it all the time, but I have friends with iPhone 7 or 6S who never use it
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.180]   Yeah, so it really is a convenience sort of feature
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.380]   I thought I would like it less than I ended up liking it
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.620]   On the iPad pro
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.300]   I still get upset when I have to reach up and touch the screen because I'm busy typing and it feels like
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.260]   You're making me stop typing to reach up and touch the screen
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.780]   And with this it was the same thing. I was like, I'm I'm busy looking at the screen
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.660]   Don't make me look down to look at this new touch bar because that's where my fingers are busy doing
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.180]   But what I realized is that I'm forced to stop all the time anyway
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.380]   I wasn't even thinking about it
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.060]   I often don't remember how words are spelled or which word is the right word
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.700]   Often I don't remember shortcuts because Adobe and Apple bless them use different keep
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.980]   To cut in final cut is different than to cut in in logic is different in the cut in garage band and illustrator and in design and adobe
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.860]   They can't even get their copy paste stuff in order
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.380]   And I would have to previously stop reach for the mouse or the trackpad
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.140]   Go up to the menu bar drop down look for the command or more often than I'd like go to help and search for it because
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.100]   I use all these as but not one of them all the time
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.820]   So I just never remembered them but now with the touch bar those commands are more often than not right in front of me
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.580]   So I look down and there's the cut and I never have to remember that shortcut anymore
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.420]   So what I found is instead of it interrupting me more often
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.340]   It's made the interruptions. I already have a little bit more efficient at least in some cases
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.660]   Do you use the autocorrect at all?
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.540]   I do you I also autocorrect is great unless you use a lot of words that don't exist in autocorrect
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.100]   When your tech blogger you tend to do that
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.860]   So when I'm just writing a letter, it's fine, but I end up turning it off because a lot of product names or a lot of the
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.140]   The stuff I want to use they get autocorrected in really bad ways
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.340]   But what I noticed here is like there's a lot of English again
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.780]   It's a horrible language with lots of different sources and spellings and variations
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.460]   And if I type it doesn't work all the time. Sometimes I have to type so much of the word
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.300]   I might as well guess at the complete word
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.380]   But sometimes I'm typing a word and it's getting better over time because it's learning how I type
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.180]   I'll look down briefly see the word and then just continue typing it
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.940]   Where previously I'd have to you know copy the word go to dictionary type it into google
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.620]   Look for google suggestions and stuff like that. So in that way, it's a little bit more efficient too
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.820]   And of course, I think everybody agrees that the one feature of the touch bar that is fantastic is touch ID
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.540]   It is great. It's essentially a little iOS device. So it is it's secure
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.980]   Uh, and the only problem I had initially is that I didn't remember to use it
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.580]   So I was sitting there staring at the login because for password and apple watch
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.780]   So you can actual text below your login saying what it's doing
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.220]   Yeah, this was nothing and I was just starting out and the text is on the
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.020]   Magic the touch bar. So then I
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.300]   And then I slapped my head and after about three or four days. I remember to do it
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.220]   But until then it's like trying to unlock a non-touch ID iPhone with touch ID
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.420]   You just spend three seconds before you so when you you don't log into your computer anymore
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:08.260]   You just touch the touch touch ID thing. Yeah, and now it's a competition because my watch will sometimes beat my finger too
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.100]   Yeah, yeah, I still for some reason it won't let me set up my watch
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   It says your the watch isn't registered with your apple ID even though it is so I don't I'm
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.820]   Still working and the one thing I miss
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.580]   Um, and you know, hopefully Steve gives them a look at this at some point is I wish apple would let us choose
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:29.220]   Like if you're in a highly secure environment to use touch ID plus password plus apple watchers some combination of what you know
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.340]   What you have and what you are so you get real multi-factor going there
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.820]   So like that that's a huge benefit to what they've said. I agree that they just haven't enabled yet. Yeah still
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.260]   I mean, this is pretty exciting and really it is too factor in the sense that you have to have
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.980]   Yes, your macbook and you need to be your fingerprint. So
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.380]   Yeah, it'd be nice if you could do the if like for super secure things you could have both
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:57.540]   The password and the finger absolutely and it's like ios where if it ever reboots or you hold down the power button and you forcibly
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.580]   You reboot it anytime. It's not just sleeping it flushes your credentials and you're required to log in again
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.100]   Sounds pretty good. Andy. Did you have anything you wanted to ask Renee about?
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.340]   Um, does it kind of freaky out that when you have the actual function keys that the
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.300]   That there is like dead space on the left edge of the of the touchpad
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.260]   That's not ever a key whereas you have the entire left edge of the physical keyboard
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.580]   Uh, that doesn't line up with anything. It's like it looks like it's like having
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.100]   The escape key like let's say one centimeter off to the left from where the rest of the edge of the keyboard is
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.740]   Yeah, it does actually because there you can actually feel the edge of the touch bar and i've gotten used to where escape is
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.580]   So I can hit it without thinking about it
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:46.740]   But if I could feel the edge of that touch bar, I would just tactfully know where the escape he was and that would be even better
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.740]   It's nice to have a little bumps or something on there
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.980]   It's just an odd choice. I'm just
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:58.420]   I'm just really surprised it input haptics behind that. It seemed like such a natural place to put the put the the taptic engine
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.500]   Next generation. Yep. You always get the feeling apples holding a little bit back just
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.140]   So they have something to do next time
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.140]   They're they're pretty adamant that they don't hold back
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.620]   But there's just some things they can't figure out for the price point
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.940]   They want to hit now and they know they'll be able to do it next year
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.540]   They may say oh, hey, we got this we could do it, but let's not do it
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.900]   But it's very much well like we got a whole you know, we get we don't have to put everything in this more
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.820]   Yeah, yeah, there's figure out where to put this could not have to do everything right away
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.100]   Yeah, because they were adamant about hitting that bargain
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.740]   $2,200 point oof
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.940]   What corners they had to cut
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.860]   It's so the the formula like I mean like yeah, they're absolutely their expense of things
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.900]   But apples typical formula is we'll buy the best price the best parts
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.300]   We can and then we'll charge our margin on top of it
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.380]   So if it's like it's 33 plus whatever it costs them to get all those parts together
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.140]   Why are you typically consistent with that?
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.420]   Why do you think they left it?
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.380]   So this is the john Gruber tweet that I imagine it prompted your your question Andy
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.540]   Why do you think they left that space?
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.140]   To the left of escape. Why doesn't this actually balance touch ID?
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.940]   Oh, don't visually balance it. It's an odd. Yeah. I mean like you can you can you can debate these things
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.260]   But I would prefer the escape key to be flush. Yeah. Yeah, it should be where the escape key was because at least we have that muscle memory
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.260]   Plus it's dead space like you said, which is just always suboptimal
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.620]   So Gruber is pointing out that about half of it does work
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.780]   So you don't have to hit it right on there, but nevertheless, that's
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.900]   Is how programmable is this could I get in there with uh with some code and
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:37.700]   Modify that you if you make an app that app can you you can do a heavy level of customization within that app
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.700]   You can also go into the keyboard settings and uh change the control strip
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.740]   What it which are the default uh application like srenity this morning was saying how easy it is to hit serie when you're trying to hit
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.620]   Uh the delete key by accident. So you can change that or move it
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.900]   It goes into jiggly mode and so you could have it if you have if you use the emax gooey
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.220]   Version of emax you could have it put the escape key all the way to the left
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.260]   Uh, I don't know how flexible it is on that
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.860]   I mean the emax would have to would have to interface with the system and tell it to do that
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.780]   Right, but I think I mean like there's so much going on there like the the amount of controls
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.980]   I've seen even now on the first week of release from final cut to like the way the iWork apps use it
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.460]   It looks like a completely programmable surface
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.100]   Almost I was joking because they did actually have a dj on stage during the event date
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.140]   Right from algorithm, but when you start using it you get like at some point
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.820]   It's one hand on trackpad one hand on the touch bar the time those one hand on the keyboard
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.180]   And you I almost felt like I was DJing with productivity for a few minutes. Yeah. Yeah interesting
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.820]   All right, let's uh, let's rip off the bandaid here keyboard
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.820]   I it's gonna be divided like and he's gonna hate it. It's gonna be incredibly divisive
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.860]   I like it better than the macbook, but I already like the macbook
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.100]   And I didn't like going back and forth my brain had a hard time with that because it would take me a few minutes to adjust
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.700]   But I haven't used my old one and I I'm really enjoying the punchy feeling but they are they do feel louder
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.500]   They are clackier, but not clickety clackier
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.300]   Uh, and I and there's the travel is not there
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.020]   So anyone who just anyone who likes clickety clackety keyboards, which I don't is going to hate this
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.380]   And anyone who doesn't like clickety clackety keyboards like me is gonna like it. Yeah
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.980]   Yeah, well, we we talked about this with in past couple shows all of all says
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.900]   I've now spent a couple of hours typing on that keyboard and no, I still hate it
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   Yeah
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.100]   Um
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.300]   It is thinner but but but also so you do get remembered that at the apple store
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.860]   You do get two weeks to take it back and you don't even have to have a reason why so
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.780]   Uh, so if that if that's your fear type the hell out of that keyboard during the first 13 days
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.940]   But in be right but if you don't like it by then
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.340]   Don't listen to people saying all you'll get used to it because if you're not used to it by 13 days
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.900]   It's time to get your money back and look at it local
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.340]   And we we should mention if you go online try to order now it's four to five weeks in the us. I understand from
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.780]   Uh, uh, said in our chat room that it's also uh four to five weeks in the uk
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.820]   Uh, but if you ordered it online day of you should be getting it this week and
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.740]   We think it's gonna be in the stores thursday. Is that
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:13.140]   Fit with what comport with what you know and understand jon on yeah, but those will be this like the apple always has several instore
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.860]   Model so it won't have any of the if you want to build the options
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.900]   Yeah, you're gonna still you want to upgrade the parts they'll do some instore upgrades
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.540]   But if you wanted exactly the way you want it you're still gonna go online
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.180]   So we didn't kind of split the baby by doing the ordering what we wanted and then
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.540]   I think thursday will be haunting the apple store and you can always take with the one you don't want back right
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.140]   Well it would end again within two weeks, but I will I will say that if you get a choice
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.780]   If you have to choose between waiting a couple months and getting it outfitted exactly the way you want
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.380]   And getting it right now and having it for december. I would wait
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.100]   Uh, the one of the biggest mistakes you can make with a macbook is bet by
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.100]   Uh, gee, I wish I had another 180 dollars so I can get the next level up of
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.700]   I am waiting till you get another 180 dollars in the kitty because remember you don't have that chance to upgrade it
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.140]   And you might be in a situation where next year you are editing a lot of 4k video
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:12.260]   And you really do need all that extra headroom and remember you this is your one chance to make your computer as perfect as possible
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.820]   Thanks to a three year. So don't don't really think that you have to have it today
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:23.220]   Oh, it's better have a better mac in january than uh, sub something. It's not quite right for you in november
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.260]   At least it comes to ram you can't change it you can't change anything about it. So make sure not even the ram you can't add ram to this
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.900]   No, no, it is an appliance. It is a field macbook. Here at least when it comes to ram pretty much apple. Sorry
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   Already kind of established that you're gonna get 16 gigs whether you want it or not. So you can get eight
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.100]   I mean you can you can have all your I can't I imagine that they'll have in store options with 16
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.940]   I yeah, that would surprise me if they only offer data in store. I mean, yeah
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.420]   I'm sure it's gonna be easy to get your hands on an eight gig
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.380]   Yeah, that wouldn't kick anything for this. Yeah, I'm sure that the is the 16 you're gonna have to wait for it
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.100]   We really need eight gigs, you know, it's so funny because we've just I think some of this is we just hey
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.060]   You can get it. So why not but do you do is it really make a difference in performance?
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.140]   We did some tests and I know like I get last year
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.420]   Last week we talked about johnathan's rsky doing tests. I we did some similar tests and
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.860]   the
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.100]   Apple doesn't just buy off the shelf parts and they they tune exactly for the hardware that they want
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.940]   That's the benefit they have for not having to support, you know hundreds of varieties of hardware
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:24.100]   So the memory compression and macOS, but also the those ssd's i'm having a hard time explaining to people how fast they are
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.380]   They just pegged every test I could I could put on them and I had a hard time actually telling when it swaps
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.020]   So absolutely it is nowhere near 32 gigabytes and if you really need 32 gigabytes, you'll know the difference
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.620]   But if you're not sure I would take and his advice and urge you to try it
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.620]   Get 16 you'll get a lot more out of
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.140]   A lot of people said eight is fine for them 16
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.180]   I think people who don't think 16 is enough will be pleasantly surprised with how much you could do it 16 gigabytes
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.860]   Yeah, if you're doing uh, somebody's saying and I think this is true beat master
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.340]   Who lives up to his name? He says if you're working with daws with digital audio workstations with many many tracks eight gigs
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.020]   And I would have thought although jonathan zadarski kind of surprised me. I would have thought photoshop would be
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.740]   uh real ram hog
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.860]   Well, I think what it it goes to scratch disc if it can't get an ram. Yes, these discs are so fast
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.500]   Maybe it isn't such a
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.260]   Disadvantage faster than the thing I noticed also is that if you use apples apps
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.540]   Like if you use safari instead of chrome if you use final cut instead of premiere and not everybody does absolutely not everybody does
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:29.140]   But those apps are also optimized for this hardware so they use much less memory than the sort of cross platform apps
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.300]   Uh, you like the space gray. Let's talk about fit and finish
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.860]   I do. I mean in the light it looks almost as silver as
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.380]   The regular macbook in the dark. It looks very space gray
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.340]   It's the same space gray as the ipad. It's not the dark space gray of the apple lock like you can see compared to the apple watch
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.660]   It's way lighter. Oh, he's showing off his Nike band. You just stop it. All right
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:57.780]   But uh, I like it just because um, I'm kind of I'm not tired
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.660]   I just am tired of a color, but it's nice to have some option
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.820]   I would have loved to have rose gold in this too of course, but or jet black or something but
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.780]   Jep, it's a choice as much choice as last year
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.220]   Renee Renee posted on instagram one of his famous
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:18.020]   Every time he buys a new it gets a new one of a new color. He adds it to the pile of here is everything that I have the space gray
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.860]   And he and he had the Nike band watch and all I can all I can think is
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.220]   How could try to pick out the one
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.100]   item on this pile
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.180]   That was not completely controlled and designed by apple so you have
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:38.100]   depressing gray depressing gray depressing gray depressing gray wow vibrant exciting green
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:44.180]   Depressing gray depressing gray depressing gray. It's full green right that's what they call it in fault. Uh, it's pretty ugly
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.340]   Uh in my opinion, but uh, no, I love it. You like it. You know, it's a great
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   It's bright
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.900]   You know actually in a way, it's funny because uh
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.820]   If these are we're truly pros by the way, here's his uh, here's Renee's picture of all the space gray
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.740]   If
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.780]   Wow, it's not all mine by the way. Those are like several families and review units contributed to that picture
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.980]   Wow
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.260]   Uh, if uh, if you were making a professional
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.700]   Uh laptop then grays and silvers, you know, they're kind of more professional colors makes sense
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.580]   If you're not making a professional laptop, it'd be nice to have some other colors in there as well
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:28.500]   Beige beige. I think pro I think pro's right want a prosaic color
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.540]   Uh, but stickers on anyway, they'll have their startups
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.580]   I run
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:42.420]   It's not a pro. I we just I would just love to see like apples design language saying let's let's have some fun with some bright colors somewhere
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.580]   Yeah, that's all that would be
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.580]   Open it up and it's pink on the inside
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:53.060]   Yeah, I just I just imagine like the set when they're when apple and she had day where like planning the 1984 commercial
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.260]   So now remember we have to make like the the ibm technology look like it's for boring people
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.260]   Who are not creative make sure we paint all of it gray and no color anywhere
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.860]   Well, sort of like those people like there's a bunch of designers and artists who paint their rooms their studios
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.540]   Interface gray because they want everything else to pop off of it
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.980]   Uh, and I think part of that logic here is you want the computer to sort of not get in the way because that's right
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.300]   You put on the screen that's gonna bounce. Pro's don't want color
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:26.500]   And yet ironically these are not pros you you actually made an interesting point in your uh instagram post following that post saying
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.620]   Pro is meant to be inclusive these days
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.260]   Which is a nice
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.620]   That was part because Jonathan I got into this art like this conversation where a bunch of people for some reason
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.220]   I was I was spared this but he got harshly attacked for his comments
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.500]   And he was saying that you don't get to define whether I call myself a pro or not
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.260]   And I started thinking about that and that's I mean not calling him a pro
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.140]   He's the FBI uses his tools
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:57.940]   It's it's kind of silly, but there are people who think my use case is pro and it's sort of like anyone who comes from a village
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.380]   Higher up than you is from the north doesn't matter how far they're a mile north
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.220]   north
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.860]   Upstate, New York is any place higher than where I live right?
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.420]   And that's what a thing like like I am a pro and anyone who doesn't use what I use is therefore not a pro
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.460]   Right. That's not fair. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You explained it
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.980]   Uh part of this is the computers get democratized and we allow more people like you you had to go to iB
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.860]   Like when I was a kid I had to go to iBm to see my dad using punch cards
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.420]   There were no home computers and now I have this crazy computer in my in my pocket
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.540]   And it just enables us to to become pro is where before there was exclusive access to that technology
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.940]   How about uh
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.100]   And going we not we're not going to rehash what we've been talking about for the last two weeks
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.700]   These are the easy way for me to add my two cents to this is just that
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:50.020]   Apple has a responsibility that other makers don't have given that they make every single Macintosh out there
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.100]   so if you
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.380]   Uh, if they make a top of the line mac that excludes a real
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.580]   Good percentage of their users that those users have no place to go
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.980]   So that's that's why I mean
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.980]   You already heard me rail about this last week about the keyboard
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:13.780]   But it's like if you don't put like a decent keyboard on in it and now you can't get a decent keyboard on any mac anywhere
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.580]   You've just said you people
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:23.860]   Go else where we don't care about you anymore. So i'm just I just wish that apple would be more inclusive across all of their product lines
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.260]   I think that's fair especially in terms like there's a lot you can say like you know people say they should have kaby
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.940]   Like but those chips actually intel has not shipped them yet and you could say they should have um
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.380]   Invidia instead of a md
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.380]   But apparently amd was willing to let apple do things that in video simply was not willing to let them do with the graphics cards
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.500]   And you can talk about ram and and what skylake support
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.340]   But the keyboard is like a choice thing
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.940]   Uh and in tandy's point that you have no other option now if you detest this keyboard apple is not making uh
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.820]   Except for the macbook air apple is not making a modern laptop for you
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.780]   So
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.140]   Size
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.740]   Feels good lighter thinner it's half a pound thinner a lighter rather
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.900]   Yeah, it feels like a macbook like it's about the size of a macbook air
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:10.260]   It feels denser though, and I don't know what that is but it's also more it's also completely is that the 15
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.700]   This is the 13 15 is
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.900]   Here
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.900]   So yeah, so like you got to do your
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.740]   Lift i'm excited about the i have to admit for all the mocking i gave apple for being thinner lighter
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.380]   Half a pound is not an insignificant
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.220]   Drop i think that's a pretty no and he doesn't buy it
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.220]   Well
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.060]   It's it's a significant loss if you're carrying it from your cubicle to the conference room and back
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.260]   I'm not I'm not mocking that that is a that is a thing mostly what i do
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:46.820]   But yeah, but but speaking as someone who just traveled like 3200 3200 3200 miles
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.220]   Uh, you don't leave the house with just the laptop right it's it's like
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.780]   Uh, it's not to me. It's not a significant it's not significantly smaller
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.860]   It's not significantly lighter
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:03.700]   For the things that have to be given up in order to get that lightness and you still carry in half a pound of extra dongles
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.860]   So that makes up for it. Yeah, i'm i'm i'm a little bit i'm a little bit
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:14.900]   Flexible on that one i'm i'm willing to think of that about that as instead of having like i'm i love the fact that i'm
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:22.020]   I'm a macbook pro in front of me. I have no my my microphone plugs right in my camera plugs right in all these other things plug right in
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:29.220]   I but i and there's also still like an hdmi port. There's also still a display port thunderbolt port a couple other things
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.740]   But I do appreciate the idea that they have said
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.660]   Instead of telling you what each of these ports is for we're just going to give you four
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.540]   Super duper high speed ports. I kind of like them do whatever you want them to do
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.700]   And given that apple has already said no no no we are the dongle company
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.020]   You are not leaving the house without at least one dongle
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.700]   That war has already been lost so you may as well, you know
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:25:00.660]   Make best out of the dongle. Also i've already invested because of phones and the pixel and the macbook in lots of type c
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.700]   interface units and i can connect anything
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:12.020]   So wait for type de lio. Yeah for type d you know i'm and Andy you've seen i'm sure there are mag safe even mag safe adapters for type c
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.340]   Yeah, that was always thought that that was the the only see but the only weird thing about that is that remember that
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.580]   uh
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:27.540]   When I when I travel one of the reasons why I always travel with like huge battery packs is that I absolutely will not use
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.860]   Usb a public usb charger even if it's one of those that you pay for because it of course a usb port doesn't
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.900]   Doesn't just give you power or it also gives it's also a data port and so I would be just as wary of
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:50.820]   uh buying a third party charger or using a third party adapter and thing like that because now it's impossible to charge your macbook without exposing the charger to the
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.940]   data bus of your machine and
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.820]   It's already possible for
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.060]   Somebody to
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.300]   Somebody to hand out free let's say usb chargers at a conference
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:10.340]   And nobody knows that there's actually extra circuitry in there that has nothing to do with charging the battery or preventing the light pose from exploding
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.740]   So it's not that's not a
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.820]   Warning it's not a reason not to buy this or use chargers
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:26.100]   But it is something that there are people that have enough really super critical data on this these machines that it will have to be something they think of moving forward
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.780]   So
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.900]   Aha moment was I was it I this is coffee shop this little mom and pop coffee shop where I there was this chair
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.420]   I liked but I could never sit in it because the power was on the wrong side
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.460]   Just couldn't be wired with this and I could plug into either side and it seems like the silliest thing
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.420]   Just being able to plug into either side because maybe you have a disc plugged into the other one and you're halfway through a backup
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.140]   And it just doesn't you can't put both but it's so nice to be able to plug anything up or down
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.940]   And no matter what way you want it right into those words. I I'll vouch for that because the crumbook pixel
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.980]   A year ago did that and it's great not having to worry about which side
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:10.420]   The other thing I like about type c is I have a lot of type c chargers lying around for phones and and even though they might be slower than the regular ones
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.020]   I presume
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.660]   That apple does what they did with the macbook, which was any of them will charge it even if it's just a trickle charge
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.620]   Yeah, you know what who didn't do that is hp hp makes a wonderful beautiful pc laptop
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.340]   uh the hp
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.340]   specter secter team t
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.700]   And it has three type c ports only one of them
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.380]   Charges and it will only charge with hp's proprietary
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.620]   Charging brick which just that's kind of dumb. That's just really stupid
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.700]   It really the fact that
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:45.380]   The fact that the macbook uses usb c for charging and also it's not just removing one kind of connector
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:50.020]   It also means that uh if you really want to have a 20 hour battery life
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.980]   That's fine again, but get get the big, you know shoehorn size anchor
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.400]   P
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.700]   Good to go. I was I was so pleased because it seemed like when I was
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.580]   Reviewing the the macbook nothing
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:13.540]   I was like I had to like double check with my contacts at apple to say that to make sure that I was seeing what I really thought I was seeing because
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.620]   I thought that there's a possibility that if apple had a way to simply say we're not
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:26.020]   We're not confident you'll get the best charging experience because the you it charges a lot more slowly
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:31.140]   And so to prevent confusing our poor our poor users. We thought we would turn these that feature off
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.900]   But it's it's absolutely great. It's absolutely brilliant and actually that's better than the iPad the iPad will uh not charge
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.020]   On some low power. Yeah, see that's that's weird
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   Wouldn't you don't you hope that they decide to get rid of lightning and just switch to usb c across the entire board?
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:54.340]   That's why I was disappointed about the headphone jack because that basically bought them into some several more years of lightning, right?
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.700]   I mean, I've been I'm raine might know more than I do in this point
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:04.900]   I'm trying I've been looking into over the past couple months about what can lightning do that usb c can't do and i'm just not coming up with
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.820]   Any real answers a little bit more compact?
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:15.220]   Uh, certainly but I just don't know any answer to why what what anybody is getting from lightning that they're not getting from
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.940]   uh from uh from uh from usb c
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.940]   Sinek would say a fatter wallet
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.580]   I mean, there's there's a couple of things uh with lightning and and the team that worked on lightning also worked on usb c
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.540]   So that's why apples all in on usb c as well
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.260]   There was a couple of things one is usb c was taking a long time and apple didn't really know when it was going to ship
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.540]   And they wanted that new connector now now now and lightning got them to market with a modern connector way faster
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.460]   Than if they'd waited it is a little bit more compact, but also they can do what they want with it
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.740]   They don't have to wait for a consortium
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.100]   So if something happens tomorrow and they decide everything is getting augmented reality
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.580]   But oh it really only needs this pin to be able to do it
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.260]   They can do that in a heartbeat and they don't have to talk to anybody or weigh anything
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.380]   And that's the sort of control that they were used to on iOS devices
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.820]   Yeah, so I mean they could they could backpedal from that they would change people be upset
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.260]   They're changing the connector again, but I think there'd be enough people that understood at this point they've been
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.620]   Oh, I don't know they won't do it next year
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.820]   But you think people would be so mad. I mean, I just finally just went headphones with lightning
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.740]   I bought nine dongles and now you're telling me type c you can't they can't
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:23.220]   This is this is meant as an observation not a criticism, but apple is the company that would say
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:29.140]   We are we are pleased with the transition to the totally wireless world that we're in
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:36.180]   We know that people rarely even connect their their their their phones to their desktops anymore via via wires
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:44.500]   And to we think that the best way to encourage the rest of the people to come into the 21st century is by having no ports whatsoever on our iOS devices
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.580]   and
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.380]   I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm saying that in any in any
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.940]   That actually like another company did that you say oh my god
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:58.500]   They just don't want to be in business anymore, but apple would say look at that. Maybe the secret that may be the way they handle this
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.620]   Right is just phase out the lightning port. Right don't even bother
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.060]   And calling it us be free us be free
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.180]   What is battery life on these is it the same
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.540]   Uh, so apple says 10 hours for all of them
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.180]   I got slightly more on the one without the touch bar
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.820]   Probably just because it's lower specks was putting less demands or maybe the battery slightly bigger. I'm not positive
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.140]   Uh, the other ones I got a little bit mixed results when we were going hardcore with final cup pro
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.860]   We got probably around eight and a half to nine hours
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.220]   Uh, but then again, I was using it the next day and I worked for three or four hours
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.700]   I said I had 11 hours left. So I just realized that prognostication is not you know the
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.980]   It's not easy, but I've gotten close to 10 hours
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:42.500]   And I won't but there again, they're brand new and I'm doing a wacky workload with three different machines right now
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.260]   Wacky workload. Yeah, well, I mean, I'm bouncing between them because I had to use all of them to get the review done
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.500]   So it's hard to say like so the next couple of weeks. I'm going to be putting each of them through a normal
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.980]   Bottom line is it's fine. It's fine because it you know, it's it's not so different that you can you know
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.340]   You can say definitively that it's different. So that means it's like a phone like you know when they ask about the phone
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.220]   It's like it's more important what cell tower is standing next to you and what the actual battery and this is the same thing
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.660]   It's more like if you're running chrome, it's less than if you're running safari if you're running final cut
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.060]   It's less than if you're running premiere and you can totally run those apps
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.420]   But you know everything every load you put on the device lessens the battery life
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:25.060]   What is uh, so now that we're getting the reviews everybody who's had them for a couple of weeks is often barga
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:30.260]   reviews have come out everywhere most people are pretty positive, but I would say in every case it's mixed
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.500]   You know, there's a little bit of
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:38.660]   You know dissatisfaction with some of the things. How about the pro community? Has that calmed down or are people
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.700]   Still up in arms. Somebody in the chat room said I know a lot of people who are
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.180]   Abandoning Macintosh now and getting windows laptops, etc
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:53.540]   Is the visceral thing? I mean like these are the people who stayed with apple and apple was doomed and they
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.780]   It's some level they feel personally betrayed
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:01.460]   And it's what I mean on one side it's easy to see apples become the mainstream computing company by virtue of
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   phones and tablets and they're seeking that mainstream audience and that leaves niche audiences behind where microsoft
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.780]   Who didn't get into more like who weren't successful at mobile?
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.860]   They're now finding an amazing market with the niche and they're sort of living in this topsy turvy
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.980]   backwards upside down
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.740]   timeline all of a sudden
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.060]   And I think that's perfectly valid in apple because they don't license our operating system and they don't make
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.220]   18 different skews of everything
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.540]   They they absolutely abandoned the highest of the highest level pros who've been their traditional customer base
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.900]   I think I have to recognize that i'm not a pro because i'm
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.540]   I think we just fine
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.740]   And for me, I'm saying i'm not saying forever, but for me
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.460]   I think 16 gigs will be just fine the speed and the all of that will be just fine and I
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.260]   I'll probably get used to the keyboard too
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.340]   Um, I want this I want a new mac book
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.460]   I do I need a new drug
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.060]   I I would only
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:02.340]   I wouldn't would even put strongly saying take issue but wanted to clare want to clarify that
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.420]   Every single user of a phone or a laptop is a niche user right everybody right?
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.060]   And so that's just a word that if it hurts your niche. Yeah, well, it's just that
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.780]   unfortunately, it's uh
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.740]   It's easy to simply say that if there's a feature of a piece of software that isn't there
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:26.980]   Well, it's just a niche feature for a niche audience. Well, the thing is it's like a feature that 100 of your users use
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:32.420]   Let's say three times at least over the course of the year when they don't find it. It's a real real bummer
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.020]   uh, and there's the larger issue of uh apple
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:43.300]   Uh still having that that reputation very well earned I think as the makers of some of the finest
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.820]   machines
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.700]   That that run operating systems that you can buy anywhere
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:54.340]   But I think that they are in danger of losing that if they decide that we're just going to keep making the exact same
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.780]   laptop over and over and over again and we're just going to redesign the case or we're going to redesign
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.940]   Uh, we're going to leave some ports and we're going to do do some fiddling here and there
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.180]   Um, it's it seems to me that if they decide that we are not going to make
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.900]   Computers for more than the one or two different types of users that we can clearly imagine
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.060]   That's not
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:21.140]   The sort of company that 50 years from now we look back and say that was a great company boy where they they could do anything
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:26.980]   They were very very smart. Uh, they were taking their job as an industry leader really really seriously
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.420]   I mean, you you can't you can't be a bakery that sells only crusty rolls
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.460]   You know, you have to you have to if you want to be a great bakery you also have to
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.220]   Show that you can make things other than roles or else the only people you're ever going to be selling to are restaurants and yet
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.860]   Damn, I love a good crusty roll
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:51.300]   And I still I still there was a bakery my grandmother's my grandmother was like a tally netalian Italian and she went to the old lady
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:59.380]   Church, okay, and and uh, the you know, of course catholic, you know, what do you want with the old lady Italian church? You want to go to their yearly
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.340]   Festival with the food
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:09.700]   The sanan's sanan's bazaar every single year. I would go I would help I would help my grandmother like a load or do whatever volunteer
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.220]   So but I'm saying that there was this bakery right behind the church
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:20.420]   That was only open like for the on the hour like right after masses and so and it was it was like brigadoon like
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:28.420]   And just like brigadoon this because and he briefly entered a different era, but he's come back
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.420]   Sorry you froze there for a moment. Sorry. All we heard was just like brigadoon
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:39.940]   Oh, no, it's like it was like it was like you you I tried to find it because it had these roles that every role like was like a snickers bar
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.380]   you know, it was like the most delicious thing ever and the
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:50.340]   And my friend on the outside puffy and fluffy on the inside just chewy and oh
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.340]   My goodness and even right now
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.420]   I'm in a faraway land thinking about this role that I have not had in 20 years
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.620]   Because I can't find it. I'm not I'm not an old Italian lady
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.660]   So I can't find the mists do not part on river street in Hyde park. I cannot find
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:10.820]   Yeah, we sound like heroin addicts talking about our roles. Oh
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.980]   Right now
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.700]   You can you can buy you can buy heroin. I'm in LA. I could buy heroin if I wanted heroin
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.060]   But crusty crusty roll no way
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.020]   Did I have a little split down the top?
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.940]   No, no, no, it was like they're there round round baked so like you
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.580]   Carried the car and there's like
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:37.140]   Now i'm sad. I'm a car man. I have a problem. Hi. My name is leo and i'm addicted to carbs
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.300]   It's not your fault
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.540]   It's nature did this to you first step is
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:50.340]   We're not the the key is it's understanding addictions that we're not addicted to things that don't make us feel great. Well, right
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.500]   Uh-huh
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.820]   That that by the way, I understand I talked to Danny boil it
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.100]   He's doing the new train spotting and it's actually it's about crusty rolls
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.100]   So I think you'll be very very pleased with the new one. They've grown up
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.660]   The kids have grown up
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.740]   All right, there's lots more to talk about I want to take a break
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.140]   But there is lots more to talk about because I hear rumors rumors rumors about the airpods
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.380]   I want to know I feel like rename I know
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.140]   Um
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:21.540]   God, I just could go on and on but and we will because that's that's a great weekly. That's what we do. But first a word
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.660]   From audible.com
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:28.100]   Andy and I are bad as addicted to audible.com as we are to crusty rolls
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:34.820]   Uh, in fact when you travel right you can't go you don't go out of the house without a good book on your uh on your iphone
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.300]   I would imagine or your aunt actually you're an andrega
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:43.460]   That's a beauty of audible by the way. It's completely agnostic platform agnostic. Yeah, I mean, it's it's even it's even worse
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:49.780]   Now that I have like these uh, I have I have uh the amazon echo and now the google home like pretty much everywhere
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:56.740]   Because now it's like google read me a story. Can you have google home read you an audible book
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:02.740]   Um, I don't think it works on audible. I have other things that can be right there, but i'm podcast coming
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.620]   Yeah, I'm sure it's coming. Although it's an amazon company, but i'm hoping it's oh, I would
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.380]   I would hope so, but that is the best reason but it does but it certainly works on uh on uh
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:18.180]   On uh, echo right that's why i'm I keep wanting to say Alexa not echo. Sorry. That's why i'm um frankly
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.380]   Uh, not abandon the echo. I have echo in every room
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:28.260]   And echoes open platform really means that more and more stuff's working with echo google slower to it
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.420]   You know, it's up to google to do that and
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.700]   Anyway, uh, that's one of the great things about audible
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.620]   It's completely runs on every platform our android ios windows. They've created windows 10 app it runs on a chrome book
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.220]   Because you can now stream from the website, which is a fairly new
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.060]   Edition. So what is audible? It's a great bookstore of audio
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.860]   Entertainment not just books. I'm talking
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.740]   Uh fiction nonfiction
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.420]   Performances lectures yet. They have the entire great courses
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:01.780]   Which just by itself if you could get you know, these great courses on a subscription would be worth it
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.060]   The best college lecturer is giving lectures and all the stuff we'd love to learn about and then go to the yeah
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.740]   Do it car sense doing right now. You go the front page of audible.com
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.740]   It's uh, you know, it's nice on my front pages customized based on what i've
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.940]   Paught in the past so it's kind of uh kind of nice like they show all the peter f Hamilton books
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.300]   In fact, this is the the best peter f Hamilton book
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.220]   One of our favorite science fiction authors steve keeps and i rave about this guy
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:31.060]   And we both agree the first one to read if you haven't read any is fallen dragon
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:36.980]   Which was not available for audio until november first is one of the things i love about audible they have this
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.460]   audible frontiers program that records
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:45.060]   sci-fi that's never been recorded before so you all the classics the azimov the hind line
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.020]   Um, and then there's this book. Where is it? I really thought this sounded kind of interesting
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.820]   Oh, I know they took it off the front pages i've already added it to my wishlist
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.300]   So what I do and I recommend you do is visit audible and add to your your wishlist

[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.980]   That I've ever bought an audible and I bought quite a few since been I joined in
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.780]   2016 years ago is still available to me. So I have a bookshelf now audiobooks. I plan
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.940]   For the rest of my life
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.540]   I I have enough to listen to that by the time I get to the end of it would be like the golden gate bridge
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.540]   I just started getting at the beginning
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.980]   This one I can't wait just came out robbie robertson's testimony
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.780]   I was a big fan of the band and the last waltz one of my favorite music movies
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:32.100]   40 years in the after the last waltz in the end of the band robbie robertson
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.060]   Tells the story and I love these rock and roll bios. What are you listening to Andy these days?
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:44.660]   I'm still about a book behind but I when my every time my new I subscribe so I get a credit a month
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.900]   Every time my new credit comes and I spend it like in the next day because oh great
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.940]   Shopping and the last book I bought was the new book by nick olferman
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.860]   Good good clean fun misadventures and sawdust at offerman woodshop
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.300]   And when you buy books on audible, it's not just
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:07.700]   What book do you want to read it really is what voice do you want to hear for six or seven hours
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:13.620]   And nick olferman for six or seven hours. That's going to make me very very happy and very very productive and
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.340]   That's it's going to be pretty darn good
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.220]   It really is a
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:25.780]   You know, he's a he's a he's a he's a craftsman. He has his own woodshop. So he really talks a lot about
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.660]   building stuff on your own
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.380]   It's it's a little bit like zen in the order motorcycle maintenance where it's will teach you about motorcycle maintenance
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.020]   But it's really about the process of solving problems
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.500]   And looking at something that doesn't work and thinking about as something you can actually accomplish
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.300]   So i've never i've never i've never had an audio book about woodworking
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.020]   But i think that this is going to be a pretty good one for me
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:54.020]   I note that it has songs on it original songs by jeff tweedy and nick olferman jeff tweedy, of course of wilco
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.540]   Wow, i'd like to hear that now is nick olferman
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:04.180]   You in real life kind of the same as his character ron swanson or completely different because he kind of plays up that character
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.940]   In parks and rec um, I think I think that his personality inform the character certainly
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.700]   Yeah, I mean, but his kind of stoic and and dry and
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.700]   But but yeah, but he is his word working is a is a real deal
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:24.020]   It's not just something where he took a class eight years ago and then decided to buy a partnership and a business and then
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.780]   Realizes this is a good thing to pose for fun book covers
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.820]   So I I tend to think that there's a there's a lot of intersection in that venn diagram between the two characters
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.500]   Interesting
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.180]   Speaking of characters. I see brian cransden has a biography
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.900]   Just came out
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.980]   life a life in parts
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.820]   Yeah, I
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   I tend to get a lot more like
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.620]   Autobiographies by people who are reading their own stories
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.340]   Because that's one of the things I think really takes advantage of the audiobooks. Yes that when you see her
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.860]   This is me saying things in the first person. Yeah, I agree
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:02.740]   I love the readers for the fiction because they get really good actors to do the readers
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:07.220]   Yeah, but the fiction but I do think that if you're listening to like james cordon
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.940]   Reading his memoirs
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.020]   That's gonna be
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.020]   Much more vivid
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.220]   You know, here's a bestseller which I really didn't think about but anacendric has a
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:23.940]   Memoir scrappy little nobody and of course she reads it anyway. Look you can see our our fascination in love with audible
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.900]   I I wish I had
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.740]   Like you Andy come the 22nd of the month my credit gone

[00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:00.980]   If there's not a drama that I'm engaged in on the television
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.500]   Sometimes I don't even think I think I don't want to spend another evening in front of the boob tube

[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:32.020]   So the last rumor was the air pods wouldn't be out till next year. They wouldn't start production of december now
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.820]   the next web
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.820]   says
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.820]   Thursday
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.820]   What?
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.540]   I'm not going to believe anything until I see them available for sale
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.220]   I mean, I think at this point is just prudent
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:50.500]   Um, not to get anyone's hopes up and just say expect them when you like take a page out of gandell
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.220]   Expect them when you see them and then order them as fast as possible
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.460]   This um, this is based on a
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.820]   report from a german blog called op-fl page
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.780]   Or maybe it's op-fl-pa-ga
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.420]   Page, uh, das is op-fl page
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.540]   So, um boy, that would be great
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:13.860]   Um, but you're right. You're right. I I don't want to hold my breath
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.060]   Um, because I'm I'm willing to go
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.820]   Wireless
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.820]   Uh, if apple can give me
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.060]   Headphones that sound as good as my well or even close to as good as my wired headphones
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.340]   And by the way, I'm using those epic twos that you recommended, Andy and those are
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.300]   Cheap they're a hundred bucks and they work fine
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.780]   And I use them with all my phones. They're the ones that sport ones that go over your ear and
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.420]   And they're great. That's the ones you like, right?
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:43.140]   Yeah, I still like them a lot. I'm still having with me here today
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.820]   Um, the only I mean you just get back to the the classic
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:52.420]   Problem of what if you need to leave the house in five minutes and you can't find the one pair of headphones
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.100]   Do you have that that work with it?
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.380]   Uh, that's when you're kind of glad that you have eight or nine or ten or twelve
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.180]   Yeah
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:04.660]   A little bit you can just grab when I left when I left the house. I forgot that my blue tooth headphones were in a secret compartment inside
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   My laptop bag so I did grab
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.980]   A wired set of headphones just in case
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.020]   But yeah, they they work really well also. I think that apple has optimized the design of the iphone
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.980]   So that it has really good bluetooth
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.620]   support a really good bluetooth of
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.780]   Antennas and radios because
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:27.460]   I'm obviously using my bluetooth headphones day-to-day on an android device and I noticed that
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.100]   They seem to cut out less on
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.020]   The iphone 7 plus and they do on my Nexus 5x
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:41.140]   Because of because the design of uh, you know, they're all around your head if you have like your phone inside your pocket
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:48.820]   Way way diagonally against you might cut out from time to time because there's just so much meat between you know the the antenna and the
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:53.220]   Broadcaster but I noticed that happens a lot less frequently with the with the iphone
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:58.980]   So still still an inconvenience, but I mean certainly never thought it would be a deal breaker. It certainly isn't
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:04.020]   According to some tech blog called iMOR
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.420]   apple is
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:11.300]   Apple is then apple is investigating augmented reality glasses
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:18.100]   Oh, that's from german on bloomberg. Oh, that's right bloomberg german said this on the bloomberg tv. Yeah. All right
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.700]   So this is iMOR article. I like to give you guys credit, but it's really based on that
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:28.420]   And the reason I don't go to bloomberg anymore or cnet hint hint is the auto freaking play video
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:34.500]   Stop it. Not gonna. Nice tie nice tie. I know he you could tell he's coming to money. Can't you
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.580]   He's like, I don't know if his money, but it's bloomberg. It's like, you know, just very
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:43.780]   Maybe it's a big time business. He walks in the door. They say here's your shirt and tie put it on kid
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:50.340]   Uh, no, no, I think he came to play he came to play anyway mark has a scoop blit
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.700]   um that augmented reality glasses
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.660]   maybe coming
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.420]   Soon right, uh, of course, tim cook is is
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:07.540]   Telegraph this by saying several times how excited apple is about ar not vr ar
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.540]   Um, you know, we've seen augmented reality glasses
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:15.060]   Sort of with google glass. I guess that's not really augmented reality
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:20.020]   I'd like to see our friend jerry elsworth does true augmented reality. I think with cast ar
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:25.860]   Well, even they are a little bit different because you have to have a a playing field of special material hollow lens
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.940]   I think hollow lens is a our yeah, that's the closest you have it to an ar. I mean, we're talking about
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.500]   When we talk about ar
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:39.140]   I've seen some demos that were just shock game right and well a magic positive course magic
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:45.220]   Well, well, and and we're talking and we're talking about simple things like not not just we always think about okay
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.620]   Well, man, see you know how we have you're playing pokemon go
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.980]   We'll imagine that but you don't have to hold up your phone or right imagine that you have like a
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.820]   a fake touch a fake computer screen off your left
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.380]   Into your wine division
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:02.420]   When it's really yeah, that's the magically demo which I was suspect
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.620]   We're talking about things like I was in a I was in a restaurant
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:12.180]   Yesterday and of course there's like a tv screen over the bar and there's another sports screen like over on the left
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.540]   Imagine just by nature you've told it that anytime you see at the anytime that there is a a screen
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.660]   Of any kind I want you to replace that with my own screens. So that if I look up over the bar
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:28.500]   I'm not looking at fox news. I'm looking at like my my last like 18 emails and on the big screen
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:34.260]   I'm looking at like a status board that will show me like when the next bus is coming or something literally like I know that
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.260]   I'm going to be taking a bus
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.420]   uh back to the hotel from this restaurant
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   I want you to whenever when the bus is about 15 minutes away
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:48.100]   I want you to put like a green like translucent bus right there where the bus is going to stop
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.820]   So I know that the there's going to be a bus filling that space
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.180]   Sometime in the next 15 in about 10 to 15 minutes
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:52:00.500]   That's how big ar is and the limitation right now is that the last 5% of how it works
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.180]   For one because I said there are a lot of non trivial things they have to fix
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:10.820]   But but also the the kind of hardware you need to really make it work and to make it a practical consumer product
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.140]   So this isn't the sort of thing where apple can any company can sort of play with it
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.940]   And decide what they're going to do with it
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.140]   Because there are other companies that already know what they're going to do with it
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.660]   They just don't know when they're going to release it yet
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:28.980]   So this might be the sort of thing where apple decides to write the biggest check they've ever written in their entire lives
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:36.260]   To essentially buy 11 years worth of patents 11 years worth of experience and 11 years worth of personnel
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.940]   So they can actually get the speed if this becomes something that consumers actually want it could be huge
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.180]   I you know
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:50.100]   I completely agree. This is the technology the user interface technology that most excites me that this invoice
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.100]   combined
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.420]   Could could completely change how we interact and I think are inevitable
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.020]   because
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:03.780]   Really what happens is it integrates computing into your environment 100 percent one of the reasons I love the amazon echo
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.500]   Is because the computer gets out of the way
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.740]   And now i'm just talking to my living room or my kitchen. I'm talking to the house
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:14.260]   Asking it for stuff and it does stuff and it's very primitive and very limited
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:20.820]   But it does enough stuff that that you really get the sense of I see where this is headed and it's I don't think we're too far off
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.900]   I can't imagine yeah
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:28.180]   For AI is much further ahead because we have all the hardware ready to go already and it's in people's houses
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.860]   And that's
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.740]   Another conversation that I had recently someone's asking what's going to replace the keyboard and my first answer was not
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   He's going to replace the keyboard because in terms of getting stuff out of your head and into a computer
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.100]   No, it has come up with something better or more effective or more private
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.500]   You know, so you don't have to actually talk about this sort of stuff
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:50.180]   But in terms of the next really big interface, it's not even voice it is AI it is the ability to
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:56.260]   Say something make make your intent known in so few words
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.780]   Because the AI knows exactly what you mean
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.780]   uh, they're
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:06.020]   One of my favorite lines in movies is from broadcast news where in one line the screenwriter
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:11.940]   Communicated how intimate these two people are these lifelong friends say what why don't we meet at that place where we went that time?
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.300]   So sure see you there
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:17.700]   You know and so AI is going to be able to do that say I want to I want to meet that guy at that place
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.300]   We went last year and they know and the AI will know intrinsically
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.140]   Instead of opening three different apps and having you parse a hundred different commands
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.100]   It can guess that I but I believe he means rene
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:33.380]   I believe he means that t put place at europe weight of gardens because and he's going to san francisco
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.820]   Renee is going to san francisco and they both in email discussed this
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.540]   And wouldn't do it automatically just like your own personal assistant would say okay, uh, so
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:46.340]   Lunch with rene at the japanese t garden at europe win a garden at 1230
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:50.820]   On december 8th is that is this what you really want and that's yep?
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.860]   Absolutely book it and you're done. That's what we're going to be talking about
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.300]   and a company that can't do that is going to be
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.460]   Market it's going to look like they're behind they're going they're going to look like
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.300]   A blackberry and an iphone world if they can't do that
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:13.380]   Of ambient computing it's just a more human way to interact with the world of all the rumors that we've heard apple doing a television or a car
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.420]   This is the one that to me makes the most sense for apple
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:24.260]   It's a logical continuation of where they are it could it could clearly be a revolution
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.980]   It's going to require a company like apple
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:35.300]   Uh, at least the apple we know and love to provide design chops because it's got it can't look dorky the google glass failed
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.940]   Half of it failed because of poor
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:46.180]   Choices about how it looks and it and it has to be used user interface has to be spot on and apple's very good at that and
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.820]   the rumor that german
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:54.100]   Is talking about says that apple has talked about glasses with potential suppliers has even ordered
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.140]   Small quantities small quantities underline of near-eye displays from one supplier
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.940]   um and the
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.580]   His source one of his sources says
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:10.900]   2018 at the earliest and that of course that makes perfect sense, especially if they're just doing tests at this point
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:19.380]   That's just one product too like that's almost like snapchat glasses, but my my guess my suspicion is that this is just this is a next generation display technology
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   You don't really think about apple is having an lcd or an led product
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:28.420]   It's just there there's an interface and it exists as communicated to us through these panels right now
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.060]   But that in apples and interface first company they're going to be
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:37.700]   Doing all sorts of products in the future that would benefit from a are I mean we were joking about an apple car having a are in the hood
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.460]   Or you know an apple even apple shuttle bus is having a are offices having it
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.900]   phones projecting a are it's it's going to be ubiquitous and
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.420]   It's one of those things where if a company like apple wasn't investing heavily in it because they have billions of dollars
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.460]   They're super smart. That's when I would start to panic. Yeah, sir
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.660]   Well, I and if I were tim cook I'd say go all in on this one
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:00.260]   The other thing that's different from this from tv's and cars is it's greenfield?
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:05.300]   There's a lot of competition and tv's and cars. We don't have this product yet
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:10.340]   Admittedly google and microsoft at least are heavily invested in doing this
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:17.780]   I'm not going to worry too much about google. They are very confused at the moment and are really not showing an ability to bring products to market
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.220]   That galvanize users in the same way apple can do it
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.060]   Microsoft
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:30.260]   Maybe because they're the closest hollow lens is real a real product. It's a it's limited and primitive in its current existence
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:36.260]   But it but at least you know they have something and they've already announced that they're going to completely redesign
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:40.100]   Windows 10 they have a new holographic interface. It's designed
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:48.100]   for ar and yet at the same time this to me just speaks of this is an apple product apple
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:54.980]   It's interface. It's exactly interface. It's design. Let's not forget design. Yeah, you know those those google glasses
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:58:00.180]   The snapchat is cool looking. You know those spectacles are kind of interesting
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:06.820]   Design is going to be a big part. You do not want to look like a dork walking around you you know, you and so
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:12.740]   If anybody could succeed at this, I think it's apple and here's my prediction. They won't be first to market
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.820]   They know how's it going to ask you
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:19.220]   Is it going to be like apple watch where there may be a little bit too early or is it going to be the iPhone where they really take their time
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:26.260]   If i'm tim cook i put 50 billion dollars into this i put i put a significant amount of going on
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.300]   Baby i would i go and i you know get the feeling from his statements
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:34.740]   They kind of are he never said anything about TVs or cars right that was analyst that was all rumors
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.900]   This he's talking about ar i figure you put you go all in on it
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.060]   You say you put a stake in the ground. I think we already know that voice
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:48.740]   And ar is the future of ui. I think we know that I don't think this is a guest
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:55.060]   Well, again a ai and ar um, but there these these are two ai areas and thank you
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.220]   Yes, these are these are two areas in which apple might actually be at a disadvantage
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.660]   They love physical design, but this is not
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.620]   This is not a system where
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:09.620]   Anybody is supposed to be aware that you are using technology at all
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:14.180]   This is going to be something that you license to frame designers that can be put in anything
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:19.380]   You know how long it took it took me to find these frames years ago because all i wanted to do was
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:23.940]   The rene's frames look great on rene because he has like a lean lean face
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.340]   But i don't like those like kind of squat white glasses because that makes my face look huge
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:33.940]   But everywhere I went all they had were variations on like bend on bend frankling glasses
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.020]   I think you can make the arkamels apple is the apple is the company that would say
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:42.660]   We've decided we've built the two perfect frames that are available in two different sizes
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.500]   And these are the ones you get you're welcome
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:49.460]   We've taken the responsibility decision away from you, but if I hate them just like if I hate that keyboard
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.100]   You can't do anything with them. I think if i'm apple. I maybe don't make them look like spectacles
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.740]   I make them look like jordy glasses or something
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.740]   Eyebrows, I make them
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.300]   on eyebrows. Yeah, crouch away because
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:08.500]   Something out of anime isn't that kind of the way apple is right? You don't I don't think you I think you want to say to the world
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.220]   Yeah, no, i'm i'm using an apple device
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:18.740]   They did that white wires because part of the concern with google glasses wasn't just that the way they look but the sort of what it meant for privacy
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.940]   Yeah, and if and at least you could identify them by the hobble on their face
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:28.020]   And with this like if apple or any company snapchat makes it cool then all of a sudden we're like yeah
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:32.340]   I'm being recorded by everybody all the time. No big deal there may there may be
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.740]   There's about recording stuff. It's just displaying
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.300]   There may yeah, but don't you think if you see somebody's looking you kind of funny and they and you know
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.420]   They're looking at your reputation score and your wikipedia page and your life
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.420]   I don't know there's a snorlax there
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:48.820]   I I think it's also possible
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:54.740]   They won't look like anything that they'll be projected into the pupil in some kind of some less obtrusive way
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.900]   I mean it could you could have something like like like you know
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:03.780]   You sometimes you have a pencil tucked behind your ear. Yeah, that might be that might be interesting
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:09.060]   Yeah, but uh because remember they're people who don't necessarily wear glasses and so that's not there
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.060]   That's that's one thing that's been taken away
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.540]   So it's it's it's a non it's a non-trivial thing to get if I wear glasses
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.300]   I don't want to wear the one style that is in every single lens crafters
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.540]   I want to wear a pair that I think works best for me
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.940]   And if I don't wear glasses, maybe I don't want to put anything on my face whatsoever
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:32.020]   So it's uh, it's a seriously non-trivial exercise
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:37.860]   The other problem is that it's not enough to just develop a lot of uh, AI technology
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.020]   Inside the spaceship and be working on it for 10 years
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.220]   You really have to send it out in the world to talk to people. That's the only way that the AI learns anything
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.220]   Well, that's why google put out data
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.100]   That's why google put out glass and and hollow lens
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.260]   Is micro sauce putting it out?
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.540]   Those were both very expensive hallens is 3000 google was 1500
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.940]   And it was acknowledged. This is uh, this is how we learn. This is not an end product
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.060]   But but but also this is also one of the reasons why apple give excuse me
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   It's also one of the reasons why google is so pleased to give you as much free photo storage as possible because that gives it without necessarily violating your privacy
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:19.220]   Learn teach the AI. Here's what a gajillion human faces look like and here's what a gajillion
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:24.580]   Pictures of uh of paris look like and so it can essentially start learning
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.660]   Uh, here is what if we wanted to reconstruct the eiffel tower from any angle?
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:34.740]   Here's what it would look like or if we uh, if we wanted to figure out that gee this picture the eiffel tower was reshared
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:41.700]   eight cajillion times, uh, and uh, and uh, and once uh, they once this human being decided to improve the photo
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.140]   Here's the difference between before and after that will teach the AI
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.580]   Well, if I wanted to improve a picture of a monument on a cloudy day
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.140]   Here's how I would do it because here's how the humans have done it
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.180]   So it's kind of be if apple simply buys a company
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.820]   Or to follow up something in house
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:01.860]   That's fine, but as soon as they make it public that's the moment that they take off from the starting line
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.180]   Not the moment that they started your research
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:09.380]   Does here's a philosophical question does apple is it all is all it takes?
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.020]   Is the willingness to do it and the money?
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.820]   Uh, and can could apple in other words kind of just buy their way into this or?
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.100]   Is it going to require some special genius?
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:26.900]   Uh, and by the way, if anybody's gonna have it at least see I don't know about tim cook's apple
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.900]   They've been buying it for years. I mean they've been buying prime sense and a whole bunch of they've been acquiring
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.220]   But what does it take to become?
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:38.020]   So the let's go back to the last big thing that apple did which is the iphone
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.780]   And which took how long five ten years long long time
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.860]   uh
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.100]   And and you had steve jobs there cr- I
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.140]   Sure cracking a hell of a whip right
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.900]   And and just beating people up and saying we you know, I'm gonna make this happen
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:58.820]   It's gotta be and I don't know if apple has that person there and I won't say they won't I don't know if they do
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.740]   uh
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.980]   Does that is that a requirement? I think it is more than more than just 50 billion dollars
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.860]   You need someone to own it. You need the genius
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.780]   Yeah
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:16.180]   I think I think the problem is that you have to have someone who absolutely doesn't give a fig about the iphone or the mac
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:22.020]   Or the apple's good at that right anything else. Well was good at that they they ate their young
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:28.500]   They're they're they're good if they if they feel as though the iphone that the people are moving away from phones or moving away from laptops
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.900]   They're not they're completely unafraid of
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.420]   They're they're they're they're okay with people stopping using iphone
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.660]   So long as the thing they replace it with is also an apple product and is a good product
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:42.100]   And it is the really the next thing and not just a different iteration of the old thing
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.220]   however, you can't have a situation where
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.820]   uh, you you have uh, you have a
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:58.260]   An executive saying that well we tried putting a eye on the watch and it really didn't work with what we're doing with the watch
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:04.900]   You can't have them saying that you have to have them say that we we tried it and they're two different things and we've decided that actually they're
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.340]   They're they're good separate but equal sort of uh sort of technologies
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.220]   Um, you also can't have a situation where
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:16.820]   It's not open and it doesn't work with all things you it's going to be such a huge pain in the butt
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.820]   Imagine imagine a mouse that has its own shape and its own button
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.620]   Sort of an al it's own button controls because people are going to be using this
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:34.500]   Basic interface everywhere and so if they don't if the industry doesn't agree on a simple and logical and rational vocabulary or basic
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:41.300]   User interface a certain fundamental knowledge that if everybody has this knowledge they're at least 60 percent of the way towards understanding how this device works
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:46.420]   It's going to be selfish. It's going to be stupid and it's going to be self-defeating so
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:53.460]   Apple would have to make this device that can eat its own young and also work with whatever device whatever desktop they want to use no
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.460]   matter what phone they want to use anything
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.980]   uh if they want if they really want to make a splash with this as opposed to
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:05.060]   Add another wedge to their profit pie and say hey look how many we sold that's what they're gonna have to do
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.540]   That's the question what what apple are we talking about?
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:14.340]   Um, and you know the truth is in the long run. It's almost always in this kind of innovation happens in in a new company
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:18.420]   but uh, but again the iPhone happened in an apple
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:24.020]   And uh only because steve was willing to to cannibalize an existing business
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:29.220]   Um, that's why again. It's unclear like yeah, glasses are an obvious product
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.580]   But 20 years from now everything the same way everything has an LCD screen now
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.780]   It could be ar layers to to allow the products that apple launches
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.340]   I guess you bit could it's beyond a single product. I guess what's required is that everybody
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.180]   uh
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.460]   I I don't think this is controversial at all that this
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.100]   ai and an ar
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.340]   are the future of ui's
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.540]   and
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.060]   Everybody needs to be working on this and I think everybody is working on this and I think
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.940]   Magic leap is very interesting google has a big stake in magically, but it isn't a google company
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.380]   Right. I I just feel like there's that's
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.420]   Something I'd get very uh excited about
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:12.180]   Can you imagine if it was like 20 30 years ago and there were these rumblings from zero oxen which like it sounds like apple and microsoft
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.540]   They're both working on these gooey things right. Those sound like they got some like right
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.300]   No, that's exactly right. I mean you would have said oh no zero oxen
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.460]   They've got all this you saw that you saw the you know what is the demo to end all demos
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:28.260]   These guys have got they've figured this thing called a mouse out and they've got windows and gooeys
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.100]   These zero ox guys man. They are all in on this and then you know
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.300]   Mouse
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.540]   and very few companies
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.780]   and name any prime tech tech company any any company is
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.540]   Finds it really difficult to escape from their own dogma
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.060]   like uh
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:53.460]   zero ox would have had big one of the reasons why they sat on it is that yes, but how does it help people make documents?
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.820]   How does it help people reproduce documents and distribute documents?
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:01.060]   They didn't think of it as here's something that could be the everything of everything
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:08.340]   This is this could help us stop being the document company and start being the communications company that could basically make us into a competitor
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.740]   uh to the phone networks or really
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:17.620]   Let let let let's not think of ourselves as just a company that sells service contracts on photocopiers
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.540]   uh, and so
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:24.420]   Microsoft and apple and google and everybody one of their biggest troubles with a
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:30.020]   A new technology like this is going to be we are not necessarily a company that makes well does
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:36.100]   Beautifully designed human interface objects. It's okay for us
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:43.300]   It's not that we're not companies a company that has a small portfolio of devices all of which are in their own little stalls
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:48.900]   And they don't really cross over very well. You have to basically decide that I know that's that's characteristic of the devices
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.100]   We used to make but this is something that requires us to do something new
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.700]   So i'm glad that for now that google is investing heavily in it
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:09:01.300]   But they're not buying it and they're not making it part of alphabet because really need this company to
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.020]   Grow and do exactly what it wants to do
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   uh
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:13.460]   Fascinating I get you see how excited I get uh, and we all get when we're talking about something
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:19.220]   Further for the future and exciting that's more than just and it's a it's an evolution
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:28.260]   You know, we're nibbling the edges. Oh, it's thinner. Yeah thinner thinner doesn't move now. It can open word perfect documents directly
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.540]   Thank you for me anymore
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:37.060]   All right, let's take a little break. Andy and I goes here shi kago sun times rene richy. I'm more.com
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.860]   Love just sitting down with these guys and talking about what's going on an apple
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:50.500]   We do it every week every Tuesday. I love it our sponsor today hover.com. They've we're so we're just love. I just love hover. I've been a hover guy
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.420]   We moved I don't know for a while
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:00.420]   We moved all of our uh, I moved all of our domain names over to hover a few years ago
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.460]   And have just been so happy with it and then uh, you know, steve gibson kind of belatedly
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:11.140]   You'd wanted to do the same. He asked on twitter who's the best blah blah blah chose hover and uh, I
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:17.300]   I you know, it's like steve I told you about this years ago and he's he was so happy
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.740]   hover
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.180]   Dot com not only is it easy to create a new domain name
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:29.700]   With that a lot of checkboxes you automatically get domain who is privacy all the classics to like common net and
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.620]   Yeah, but also pizza dot pizza dot
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.580]   Look at i'll look. Let's just let's say, uh, let's say
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.140]   uh east

[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.180]   Studios
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:45.700]   And i'll just use the for I won't say dot com. I'll just say east side studios
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.340]   And then it'll show me
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:54.740]   All the different uh things. Oh look east sides dot studio. Oh, I like that or
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.460]   I like that dot store dot x y z dot tech dot code dot global
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.900]   Dot I mean it goes expert guru dot mom

[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:24.100]   Hover starting monday november 21st will have the dot blog domain
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:31.460]   Extension now this was exclusive to wordpress for some time and I guess that their exclusivity is expired or I don't know
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.980]   Maybe they've done a deal with wordpress, but this is great. I am going to immediately register that dot blog
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.820]   domain name
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.660]   But you have to go I would suggest you go right now to hover dot com
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:49.700]   Slash name my blog so that you can as I did put in your email address and get notified as soon as they're available
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.220]   Now once you register your dot blogger dot com or dot pizza
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:12:00.100]   You'll note that you know heavy handed up selling you you you you set up your domain quickly with a website and a few clicks
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:05.220]   Uh free who is privacy? They know you want that so they just bundle it in
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.060]   And if you ever have a question or want some help
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:13.700]   They are known for their no way no hold no transfer phone support
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.460]   And they're nice because they're canadians they're friendly
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.020]   They want to help you
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.580]   if you if you I had domains on three or four different registrars
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.580]   and uh
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:30.260]   I'd saved a lot. I just brought them all to hover you can consolidate them all
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:35.700]   And uh the more names you have in your account the more of a discount you're going to
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.100]   Automatically get
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:41.860]   So this is a great time to have a blog at the dot blog domain. I love that
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.980]   You should have a blog
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.660]   You know why you want to blog?
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:49.940]   Because if you don't have a presence on the web if you don't put stuff up about yourself and young people
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.300]   I'm talking especially to you
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.380]   You know put the best of you on the web
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:57.940]   Then whatever anybody else says about you on the web, that's what people find
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:03.060]   You need to do this proactively you need to do it now create a presence for you
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.860]   online hover
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.460]   Dot com

[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.460]   hover dot com

[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.340]   I like that don't forget the offer code mac break
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.780]   And do you not go
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:34.260]   Other hello there. He's in a lovely hotel room in los angles
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.620]   Is it nice to be doing the show in the morning for a change?
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.300]   Uh
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.940]   It means that I have to get my butt out of bed earlier
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.420]   But that's okay because this is this is one of those rare weeks in which my goodness
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:53.540]   I'm waking up at like 6 30 in the morning. I'm not one of those bums who's doesn't get out of bed until 10 because 639 30 your time
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.740]   That's right. Yeah, you're an early. Don't worry. But by Thursday or Friday. I will be my brain will won't be falling for that anymore
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.180]   Oh, wait, it's only 630. We can sleep for another three hours. Yeah
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:08.500]   The reason that we start all of our shows at 11 is because I get to start the shows when I want to
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.740]   And I don't want to get up early
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:14.900]   I remember having to you know in radio having to do a morning show is the worst thing in the world
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.820]   And then eventually I was able to get to the mid days
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:22.660]   And and the best though is afternoon drive because then you don't have to get up till noon because you don't have to show too
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:25.300]   Uh
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.820]   And of course from imore.com a man who is up early
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.300]   Every morning you don't write a million words. Don't write themselves
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:38.980]   Renee ricki embargo is Leo 8 a a m eastern time embargo is poor poor south coast people
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.620]   That's not the apple book. Is it no no the the macbook pro is eating
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.300]   What is apple book? Yeah, the apple is announced a book. What is this? This is
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.940]   iconic
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.100]   Alex gumple brought this in
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.620]   Apple this is not the apple book apple is in that just announced
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.340]   this kind of also
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.380]   $300 book they announced 450 pages
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:09.620]   Designography. This is the auto designography. Yeah, this one is not is this one from apple? No, this is no iconic, but this is kind of cool
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   Alex gumple had this one
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:18.020]   So this is forward by Jim dalrymple and steve wasniac. Wow. All right. There you go
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:23.620]   So how is this how is iconic which is already out different from what apple is about to do
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.060]   Uh, well the apple one is done in the apple style
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.140]   So they hired i'm blanking on the name now
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.340]   But they hired a renowned photographer who has a very sparse style and paid them on godly amounts of money to take
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:40.340]   Photographs of apple of generations of apple products that sort of epitomize the era of the original iMac from
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:43.540]   1998 to yeah pencils in 2015
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   Lots of white space
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:50.420]   It almost looks like you know, and it looks like the images that you get when apple and apple and a product. Yeah
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.340]   Yeah
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.380]   Those are those a little bit just disappointing when I read the press release that
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.900]   um
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.900]   They're not going beyond
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.980]   the johnny i've
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.740]   But they're not going beyond 1998 like for the return of uh steve jobs
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.500]   And they did some really wonderful designs well before that the original apple two is just beautiful
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:18.660]   The apple to see also beautiful for heaven's sakes the mac the first mac was absolutely just a firework when it came out
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:24.660]   Let's see some love for the g4 cube, which I still think is one of the coolest designs for any computer ever
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.980]   Yeah, i'm sorry. I gave mine up
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.980]   I wrote my first book on that
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:34.660]   Um, it was like it was every time every time I would had to like uh do maintenance on it
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:39.140]   I felt like i'm on star trekks the next generation. I'm jordie leforge. I'm in the core
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.860]   I'm pulling the diluteum chamber
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:47.220]   Actually, you could save a little money if you get the little one that's 10 by 12. It's $199
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:50.340]   apple book nano the apple book nano
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:55.540]   I think it's one of those things uh, I put the video there's a johnny i've narrated video
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:59.700]   Uh in the chat that sort of it sort of explains why book
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:04.660]   Yeah, he sort of explains why he's doing this and what the philosophy apple design is and why they're sharing it
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.380]   It's got japanese subtitles, but it's interesting so
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:16.500]   So now we know a johnny i's been busy doing we're a yeah small design team. We've worked together for 20 25 years
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:23.060]   One of the things that we've learned is the importance of listening because as we all know the
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:30.100]   Very best ideas can very often come from the quietest voice realize that this this isn't self promotion
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.100]   This is really
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:39.220]   Strolling to put their wagon history is an opportunity in libraries of design schools and how many you're going to have
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:46.660]   And so over the years we've really created a team and an environment that I think really
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:52.340]   Increases the probability of good ideas and when they actually arrive, I think nurtures them
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:56.340]   The design studio really is a workshop
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:03.460]   We design three-dimensional objects and we make lots and lots of models and prototypes
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:10.420]   You know the number of people they've been trying crouching down those tables makes me think that tables badly designed
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.060]   The higher table
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:18.420]   Tools had to be designed process had to be created and experimented with
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:25.700]   We've worked very hard to create the tables with great rapes. What's under all these different facets. Who is this guy?
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.700]   I
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.180]   Strange your thing is rented to be
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.980]   In case you be discoloration tested
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:40.340]   Is he a guest or is he a host we have really made it a practice? I think he's so just have our head sound
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:46.900]   And I love definitely a host and ignore in some senses all the reasons why something shouldn't be possible
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.700]   Uh he's sitting on the table
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.660]   He put off seats there stacks up that
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.980]   of
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.300]   Cushing a lot of like blue jeans and black white all over shocking change
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:04.900]   You understand what's the nature of us? Oh, it's so much more
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.940]   When you understand how it came to be
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:15.220]   The book tells dozens and dozens of stories doesn't look like this any text momentum you see oh learning
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.780]   Of course, there's design this maybe it's because they wanted a few international. It's not and also I think they're not the design city
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:28.980]   So I think they've been saying the story that they tell is under designs. They don't really have to explain it right
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:35.780]   So is this uh dedicated to Steve Jobs? That's nice. So that's that's what this is. That's why Andy
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.260]   I guess no pre Steve Jobs designs in here. This is the Johnny. I've Steve Jobs
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:45.780]   Collaboration is what this really is is a seat. You know, there's a story about Steve Jobs and the apple 2c
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:50.340]   About him when he was just vice president just basically bursting into
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.860]   Someone's office with the person had the ability to go a project
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.420]   And he simply laid down a story says he he laid down like an apple 2e motherboard
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.180]   Took a half-height drive
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:04.180]   Plopped it down on the top of the motherboard took a keyboard plopped it down on the other end of the motherboard
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.980]   And just somebody said that is a great product. We should make it
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:10.740]   Yeah, and maybe he had a conversation with somebody else who's who did the same thing
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.060]   But it's not as though he wasn't involved in that
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.140]   I think Steve was always in the back of the talk is
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:21.700]   Their back-attage was him. Yeah, no was tells. Yeah, why's tells the story with the apple 2?
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:26.500]   Uh that you know, Steve wanted this injected uh mold injected
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:32.660]   Uh case and you know was thought that's crazy. That's expensive. Nobody's gonna. Why are you doing no?
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:36.100]   No, no, I think Steve had that design sense very early on there's no having a family
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.660]   This is mostly Johnny's relationship with Steve though
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:44.580]   This is this is I'm you you nailed it. This is the Steve and Johnny partnership is this yeah now
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.180]   If
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:50.980]   Fill me in is this a traditional thing that you make and you put in design schools Andy? I mean is that kind of what
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:54.180]   Because I don't know what the market is for this
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:58.500]   If you I mean certainly I don't think there is there thinking that apple fans are going to be getting it
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.420]   I don't think I don't think it's a coincidence that's out in time for christmas because it's it's a it's a
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:05.940]   Tainable price, but I really think that the way that they put that together
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:12.260]   It really is that they if you go to like a graduate design labs schools
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:19.460]   Again, you see you see that you see like the in-house library and they are really these big heavy nicely put together books
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.020]   And they are the the armada
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.460]   They're they're the flagship of a design firm saying here is what we do here is the story that we're trying to tell
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:34.820]   Here is what our taste is and it always goes down to here is how we believe that humanity interacts with physical objects
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:40.740]   So it's not just a matter of promoting themselves. It really is we want when students go into design schools
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:46.020]   And they pull something down off the shelf our story is going to be alongside everybody else's story
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.700]   So you certainly don't want to cheap out on it
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:53.780]   You certainly want the best photographer you can because you can't have a book that includes stapled into it here is stapled into this
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:58.660]   Here's an ipad stapled into it here is an iMac g4 stapled into it here is a 20th century
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.060]   Mac a 20th anniversary Mac
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.780]   Uh, it's it really is I think a nod to history
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:06.500]   I like to see apple do more of this sort of thing
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:12.740]   I really do want to see them recording their histories so that other engineers in the future will be able to learn
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.620]   Techniques that were created and perfected at apple
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.180]   Yeah
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:21.300]   I think this is also like as johnnie says it's not about looking back is about looking forward and when you when you hear about people who've left apple
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:27.380]   Prototyping, um and they say like finally like right now the mac pepro that ship has stuff that they've been working on eight years
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.300]   That we're sort of seeing the end of the stuff that steve was involved with rolling out
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:36.580]   And this is the cap again the cap of that relationship and from now on it's it's moving forward
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.020]   Will it be on iBooks in the iBooks store?
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.180]   I hope I mean I hope this is a very like people people were saying it's super expensive
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.580]   And it is but like mark new sims book is a thousand dollars
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.940]   I think I paid $250 from my original dark knight returns
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:56.100]   Uh graffiti design book. It's it's not uncommon in the world where this book exists. It's and it's for the series
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:58.100]   I remember going to a very
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.140]   famous very wealthy hollywood
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.580]   Directors house and they had an art book giant. They had it's it's ahead its own
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.860]   stand and its own pair of white gloves
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:15.460]   And uh so that you could you could you wouldn't you couldn't you know, it was clear don't touch this
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:20.180]   Use your like and that's so if we're a certain class of people that's like that's a thing
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:21.860]   It's an object dart
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.020]   My mother was a professor of art and art his art an architecture history and I remember
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.380]   We're going to museum. There was a child and she would buy these magnificent art books and they just filled our living room as a child
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:36.260]   So this I mean this this very easily fits into that. Yeah, yeah that I love those were giant Michael
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:41.940]   Books bigger than I was yeah, I know and I grew up with that too and I love that that that that resonates. Yeah
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:47.060]   Yeah, you'll be you'll be able to not only buy them but also take a look actually look at them at a
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:54.020]   Certain's handful of select ultra landmark apple stores like the like the New York apple store
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.420]   And i'm looking forward to when I make my
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.780]   Check out that book
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   I'm going to bring my magnifier because I bet the printing on that book is going to be
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:08.900]   Magnificent where if no matter how much you magnify the photo you will not be able to see the screen process
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:12.580]   It will just look like an page is going to be like an art print
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.300]   I
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.140]   Imagine that we're going to see
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:26.660]   People buying them so they can razor them apart and sell each page as an art print on ebay for like $50
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.660]   And they'll make their money back time to eight
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.900]   Uh, we're starting to lose Andy so I tell you well
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:39.460]   Let's take a break and maybe call Andy back while I do an ad how about that and we'll just say we only available in select countries
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.220]   So check apple.com. It's not available everywhere. Okay. Yeah, so
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:50.740]   And we'll get some final stories in as we fix Andy's connection and get our picks of the week as we
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:55.220]   Begin to wrap up our show today brought to you by a fine work of art in its own right
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.860]   You know corning is to glass
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:04.180]   What apple is to phones corning is the glass company your gorilla glass
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:11.860]   Corning uh when I was a kid I had corning where as a kid, you know the glass where I think they sold that division off now
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:17.140]   And they really are focused on technology products including fiber optics fiber optic cables corning makes
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:23.460]   Pretty much all the I think the fiber optic kegels certainly the best known fiber optic cables and they have a consumer product
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:28.820]   Which I think you'd be very interested in they have improved the glass original fiber optic cables are fragile
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.740]   Delicate if you think of strands of glass
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:39.860]   In a shielded cable you can imagine right and I remember when we first got fiber optic cables at the brick house
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.260]   We you know Russell said don't step on that
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:47.140]   Don't don't mess with that. We actually had a suspended from the ceiling so they wouldn't get messed with
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:52.260]   These new fiber optic cables from corning are kind of amazing you could tie them in a knot you could tie them in a bow
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.620]   You can crimp them they take a bending and they just keep on
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.980]   Sending so whether you're in and oh here's the real advantage from your point of view they're thinner
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.620]   really thin lighter
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:07.460]   very strong very durable very flexible and
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:13.860]   Because it's fiber optics you can have cable runs of up to 60 meters. That's 200 feet for thunderbolt
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:17.300]   60 meters where you get this the new the new Mac
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.860]   60 meters
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.220]   50 meters or 165 feet for USB 3
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:27.940]   That means you can take noisy devices and put them
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:31.220]   outside the room
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:36.180]   You can eliminate clutter you can eliminate the noise the heat from hard drives and the like
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:41.620]   You know, it's nice to have giant drive arrays. I have a giant drobo with five spinning drives in it
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:44.980]   But that thing I don't want to keep that next to my computer the whole desk would vibrate
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.460]   So I use a USB 3.0 cable from corning
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.340]   Now the nice thing is you don't have to have an optical interface for it that's built into the cable
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.260]   So these plug into the regular thunderbolt and USB 3 ports
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:05.380]   Just like any other cable, but they have the optical interface built right in in a very compact way into that connector
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:09.220]   And then it's sending via light people are using this everywhere
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:13.540]   uh universal audio. I don't know if you're familiar with them they do uh
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.380]   thunderbolt audio interfaces and other audio equipment
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:22.500]   They use the optical cables by corning to achieve acoustic isolation
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:27.380]   In their studio as they test new equipment. So if you've got a thunderbolt audio interface
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:33.700]   You want to have a sound studio, but you don't want the drives in the studios the last thing you want. So universal audio
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:41.220]   Uses thunderbolt optical cables by corning to kind of move them outside. It's so the I love them
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:47.540]   In fact, we can't keep them in this in this in here. They keep disappearing and I confess I brought a few home
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.100]   I have the I have the thunderbolts
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:54.020]   And as I mentioned the usb 3.0 for my dorobo
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.740]   optical cables by corning
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:01.940]   All available at all major electronics and professional IV retails of course apple stores
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.380]   I love this connector. That is just kind of really cool technology
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:11.220]   I think that was key to making this uh consumer product was that that adapter that it's not even adapter
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.140]   It's just a connector that that turns the signals into light
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:23.860]   Bnh has them Amazon has them and you can find out more by visiting the website optical cables by corning dot com
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:30.820]   Bendum twist them not them. They work they take a bending and they keep on sending optical cables by corning
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.820]   dot
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.100]   calm
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.580]   All right when we find a product like this I uh
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:41.380]   I love to share with you and i'm you know, I'm glad they bought advertising, but I probably would be talking about it
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.460]   Oh, don't tell them that
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.300]   I'll probably be talking about it anyway, but don't tell
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.380]   We need the money optical cables by corning dot com those drobos aren't cheap
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.420]   Uh, any an echo do we call you back?
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.580]   Yes, good. It sounds great. It's working great. You know sometimes after an hour or two
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:04.340]   I think I think hotels cut you off
[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:11.300]   Skyprot and wifi rod. Yeah. Yeah, I think that they say let's see if this person is asleep or has left the room
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.580]   And forgot forgot the laws in the radius for our
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.180]   Screaming it by the way js tapples in our chat room makes an excellent point
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:22.580]   Which I should put in the ad copy for these corning cables. They are impervious to uh
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:25.380]   Our effort interference because it's light
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.900]   So if you have a seat we have this problem all the time with our mic cables, right?
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:31.140]   We have to round them around the all the power
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:36.100]   Transformer bricks and stuff because otherwise you get 60 hertz ground loops in there and sound
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.300]   Not with optical cables. No the corning cables, you know
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:44.660]   They're impervious because they're because this light light's not in your you know, you're feared with
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.580]   Uh, any did I miss any stories before we go on to our picks of the week that they're that we only got part
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.020]   Loy through the
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:55.620]   The rundown. I just want to make sure there is there anything you guys wanted to talk about for instance?
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.420]   Apple's new macbook pro generated seven times the revenue then the macbook at launch
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.100]   I don't I am I didn't report that because I feel like
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:08.100]   Pre-orders are very specific. You know, those are orders sight unseen
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.580]   Those are the hardest core
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:14.740]   Users the pen up demand for people who just you know like me had a right six-year-old
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:19.060]   Laptop just had to have the new one. I don't think they reflect the ongoing
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.900]   Success of the macbook pro. I think that we're gonna have to watch and see
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.900]   Yeah, the macbook. Nothing was a brand new product and it was also a really freaky product
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:31.140]   So it wasn't gonna be it was never intended to be something that everybody would want whereas the macbook pro
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.700]   Is the thing that everybody's used to buying every two and three years and there this penny up demand you're right? Yep
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.820]   Uh, the market is probably bigger now. I've done a lot to grow their market compared to previous years
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:48.020]   Uh, we didn't mention well, maybe uh, I'll save that for a pic of the week. I was gonna mention touche
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:56.500]   Uh, oh so great. Yeah. Well good. You know, I don't know that Daniel jalcutt can code who knew oh that man is amazing
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:02.580]   So i'll make it my pic. I haven't used it yet, but uh, if you want to test drive the touch bar
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:08.660]   Uh jalcutt our favorite red sweater software guy has created an iPad app
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:16.260]   Uh that will let you uh test drive it on your mac actually it's not is it ipad or is it no
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.580]   It's on the mac app. Sorry apologies
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:22.980]   Touche you download and install it and it's a mac app that you open and close
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:27.060]   Uh, let's take screenshots of the touch bar and whatever it shows
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.580]   So the idea is not that you can touch it because you obviously can't
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:36.500]   But you can see what it would look like you can see what you're missing. Yeah, yeah, uh, and this is the same
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:44.180]   It's this is actually the interface or is it his guess at that? Like I noticed. Well, no, you could pull it out of x code
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:48.740]   I mean I forget about some people were pulling it out of x code previously and uh, steve stratton smith made a
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:54.820]   Uh, get held repository that you can buy but uh, Daniel made a version that's just super great for everybody to play with
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.860]   It's not a geeky thing. It's a it's an everybody thing. You know what?
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:02.660]   And I was I was matter of fact I was using it on uh with uh duet display on my ipad
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:06.020]   And it was actually pretty cool to actually have the touch
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.260]   Oh, so you could that's why I was confused so you can put it on your ipad with duet
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:10.900]   Well, no
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.220]   Well guys duet display means this just being used as an external monitor for my mac
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:18.580]   And of course it and the touch display works as a mouse
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.140]   Uh, but just just that was pretty darn cool
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.380]   It's it's it's such a it's such a it's such a
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:29.140]   Remind me of like the the stuff the software that would come out during mac hack that the the really really great intense
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.860]   Mac developers conference in michigan that stopped
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:36.900]   Happening about 10 years ago where it just be these really really weird hacks
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:41.860]   Uh, like this will just this this system extension will turn the entire mac interface into askey
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:47.300]   Askey text and everything would work and so while we decided to have give you touch id on the desktop
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.500]   For for people who don't have the people who don't excuse me
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:54.660]   That the touch bar on non-touch bar max it's it works really great
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:59.620]   I think you'll satisfy a lot of people's curiosity about what they're missing out on by not having a touch bar
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   So I think that maybe it'll even sell a few mac books. I hope that apple leaves it alone
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.740]   Uh, because a lot of people it's such a they're they're worried about what that
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:14.180]   Interface will look like and if there's actually gonna be anything useful to them and this gives them a chance to actually play with it
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:18.100]   I would show you but you do have to have the very latest version
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.220]   Yes of sierra, which I didn't even know I didn't
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:27.780]   So it says touch bar not supported you have to be running 10 point 12 point one which I am
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:31.860]   But it has to be build 16b 2657
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:35.380]   Uh, so
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:39.300]   How do I update it? Do I have to I can't do it? I think you have to get the developer
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.780]   beta this might guess
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:46.340]   I'm also guessing that apple's gonna update grab or something similar to to make it
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:49.140]   Uh copy the touch bar. I don't know when that'll happen
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:53.220]   Maybe like a soon to be released version of macOS, but I'm guessing it'll be an easy function
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:58.980]   So this is really also kind of like I would kind of like when you screen grab a multi monitor setup
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:03.620]   It just works. They'll grab everything. So that's this is really I think that works already
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:09.540]   Some people were saying that the three number combo would grab that as part of grabbing the overall display, but I have to double check that
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:16.020]   All right. Well, good. Thank you, daniel for writing that and that I'm sure the ink stained wretches
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:20.500]   Who have to who have to write about the touch bar will be very grateful
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.500]   We are yes, because they can at least do screen grabs
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500]   Uh
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500]   Renee, what's your pick this week?
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:33.220]   So my pick uh, I haven't had a chance to try these yet because they were just announced but
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:35.780]   Uh, they looked fantastic and I'm ordering them
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:40.340]   So they're called tom's and they're a company that make the tom says a lot of really good work
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.060]   And they're doing exclusive made for iphone as part of apple's program
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:49.860]   They're making tom's bands for apple watch and what's so cool about this is there's a couple styles and they look really really cool
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.380]   But also when you buy one you donate a year of light
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:58.180]   Uh to uh, yeah, so there's you know, it's it's like the gift time program
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.180]   Sorry, I was trying to remember the name of it you put it up on the screen, but it's a gift time program
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.180]   So not only do you get a super hot
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:09.860]   Still relatively brand new so very few people will have them, but you'll be doing it for a noble cause which I think is great
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.420]   And the patterns are great. They have um
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.660]   Sort of natively looking bands and they have bands look almost quilted
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:21.780]   And they have sturdy leather on the inside and it's a really uh novel look at least to me
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:27.060]   And again good cause um a year of light for people so and they're not on the holiday season
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.380]   It's you know, you might think oh well, that must mean a hundred dollar band. They're not expensive. They're $50
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:36.580]   So it's a just 75. I think for the beginning what you get. Yeah. Yeah, really and they're beautiful looking
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:41.620]   I'm gonna go buy one right now. Thank you for the recommendation. That's really cool
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.500]   Andy and I co your pick of the week
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:49.220]   I'm using I've been using my pick of the week all during the show this is what
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:52.820]   This is the
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:56.500]   This is the blue microphones uh raspary mic i'm going to
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:02.660]   I'm going to demonstrate how nicely directional this microphone is by actually letting you see it in front of the camera and turning it away from me
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:07.860]   And as you can see it kind of rejects whatever else else is in the room
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:12.580]   But I might have to get this for my my office so I can record ads in this
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:16.980]   Yeah, I think it's a great microphone because I've as anybody
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:22.500]   Anybody who does a lot of podcasts and a lot and does a lot of traveling knows
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.860]   It's hard to find like a portable microphone that
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:34.340]   Maximizes everything meaning that it's it sounds really good, but it's way too big to really carry wherever you to carry on a trip or
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:41.060]   It's compact, but it doesn't have any creature comforts that makes it really convenient to use
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.020]   This one is the first one. I've tried that really
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:49.300]   Maximizes everything not only does that sound really really good. I haven't actually done on audio levels check
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.980]   So hopefully the art level is okay, but talking about creature comforts. It has knobs on both sides for
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:37:01.860]   You can plug in your own headphones in the back here, but there's a there's a headphone volume knob on the left here
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.740]   And there is a microphone gain volume microphone gain knob on the right here
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:11.060]   So I don't have to you know dive into settings to get the optimal setting
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.300]   I can just simply turn the knob until I get it right also also it has
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:19.620]   He just turned his mic off ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.420]   It's kind of mute button
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:27.620]   So if you just tap on it by the side not only does it mute the mute but it'll also turn that might that led
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.460]   I guess from green from green to red. So you know that you're muted
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:37.460]   Little little things like it comes with this little tabletop stand
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:41.860]   Which I took off because one of the little tricks of getting
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:45.940]   Microphones to work really well is to make sure that they're not like a foot away from your face
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:50.020]   But i'm sorry, but it so it has a folding stand that also
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:56.100]   Sort of protects it a little bit in travel by making it sort of a little cage around it
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.540]   But it mounts with a regular little tripod mount
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:06.580]   So if you take it off, you can actually use your your grill a pod or whatever a little tripod you happen to travel with
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.220]   And stick it wherever you want
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.580]   And do stuff like that and finally it also comes with
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.780]   It was designed so it works pretty much with anything
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:20.180]   And it actually comes with a usb to lightning cable so you can use it with your iphone
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.700]   You can use it with your ipad
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.580]   I can use it with my android phone if I have a little usb c
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:26.900]   adapter for it
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:31.620]   And it's it's not cheap it is 200 bucks, but if you
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.500]   what I
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:40.420]   It's painful only until after the first time you travel and you realize that I didn't have to bring like three or four different things that would
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.820]   Sort of kind of almost be the right solution
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:50.260]   This is finally like the one microphone that can take with me for field recording and also for actually doing live shows
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:54.660]   So this is going to be seeing this is this is the sad one of the sad things where they sent me
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.860]   A review unit and i'm going to have to now
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:03.860]   Find 200 dollars my budget next month to actually buy one because it sounds really good. I have to say
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:08.420]   You could have fooled me. Yeah, and blues used professionally a lot, but
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:15.060]   Some of the blue usb consumer grade mics early on the snowball for instance were not great mics
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.900]   This sounds very very good. I'm very impressed. Yep
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.620]   They make they make top end mics that
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:26.980]   That would appear on like structural studio albums and they go all the way down to inexpensive consumers
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:30.180]   Where I think everyone here is a fan of like the the yeti mic
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:35.940]   Which is very very flexible and you get it for 100 bucks, but it's like it's like a problem with a loaf of bread
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:39.540]   It's just you can't really do that. I think this sounds better than the yeti too. I have to say
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:44.900]   It's yeah, I think it sounds really good. Now. I finally got the stand back on so you can see that
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:50.020]   Yeah, a very compact. Does it have a case or something so that I can yeah
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:55.860]   You get you get a you get a not a soft case, but you do get like a nice drawstring bag that everything can can go
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.300]   mics people
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:02.900]   I think don't realize that mike can easily be broken by mishandling it's a fr- fairly fragile instrument so
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:07.620]   Yeah, so you do have to be careful as a matter of fact, uh when I when I buy mine
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:12.500]   I'm probably going to like buy a little find a little cheap plastic case
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:16.260]   That's big enough for it and just give it a little bit of you know, not protection
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:22.820]   Because remember there's sensitive elements inside here and this difference between making something that sounds okay and something that sounds really good
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.980]   the ones that sound okay, you can
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:30.580]   Drop them off of a moving car and at least still record sound but if you want it to sound really good
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:36.020]   Also, I can pretend I can pretend I'm I'm reporting for mine less nesbun here
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:39.380]   It looks
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:43.860]   Percussating doesn't like industrial design on it, but I actually really like the industrial design too
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:50.500]   I like I like that it looks nice, but it doesn't it doesn't try to be cute or cute seeing clever and record about it
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:56.100]   Right, uh, it's but it's a very very practical shape for putting it you'll find space for this in your bag
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:59.620]   It doesn't have like weird lumps all around it where you find that okay
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.460]   I need gonna need to you know
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:05.620]   Carried carry it in a separate purse because there's no other bag that will hold this that's going in my shoe
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:08.580]   It's like if lungs in a world's fair. That's kind of design. It does doesn't it?
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.740]   I'm putting it in my shoe. I'm gonna put it in the bag
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:15.860]   I'll put it in my shoe the shoe will protect it. It's important. What's in your shoes? It looks like it'll fit perfectly, right?
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:19.220]   Yeah, your audio sounds great, but it smells
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.060]   cheesy
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.260]   Hey, oh, hey
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:27.460]   I take good care of my shoes. I usually have a wooden shoe trees in leathery goodness
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:32.660]   Hey, ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of this fine episode of mag breakaway glee
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:36.980]   We do thank you so much for being here and he not goes at the chicago sun times
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:41.380]   When he's not in los angles you're out here for the mac tech conference
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:48.980]   I'm here for the mac tech conference. Yes, and while actually while i'm promoting things i've launched a brand new podcast on relay.fm
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:51.780]   Told us you're gonna do that. Yeah called simply almanac
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:58.980]   Uh, and you can go to relay.fm/almanac to check it out and subscribe first episode dropped last week

[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:07.860]   And of course there are blog posts that explain what the whole concept is but really happy with it. The logo is oh my god
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:12.900]   I can't believe that I have a this is the this is the logo of a podcast that I would subscribe to I like that logo
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:19.140]   It's like uh the united nations kind of laurel branches, but inside all the little andiennaco things
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.540]   For gold foil embossed the act actually I actually sent them a scan of
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:29.140]   An almanac I own from 1853 from my collection for like the pebble texture of the book
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:34.820]   And I think that to oh that's oh that's that's that's what that's what we're looking for great. Okay. Got it. And yeah, so that's
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.220]   The microphone that has to be a win
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.940]   I've you know and do you know that I've spent my entire life telling publishers that no
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.420]   We can't use the hat as a as a logo for anything because I don't because that means that I no longer
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.980]   Will have the option of not wearing the hat the things but that could that appear like oh my god
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.980]   That is so good. I can't say no
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:43:00.100]   Sorry, the content the content is also very good. I'm saying but I have a lot to live up to live up to that logo
