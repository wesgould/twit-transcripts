[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Is Apple bidding on NFL games?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It turns out that most users, they use the apps that came with the phone,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and now you can install Windows 3.1 on your iPad.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hi everyone.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This is Alex Lindsay, sitting in for Leo, who is in parts unknown.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   At least unknown to me.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But he probably just didn't want me to come and visit him while he was on vacation.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   But I am.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We do have the regular folks here coming in from Montreal.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We've got Renee Richie.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hey Renee.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hey Alex, it's so good to be here.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You look so good.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I can hardly tell where the polygons are when you move.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's amazing.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   You know, we've been working on the rendering.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   There's a little bit of too much of a freckle filter going across here, but we're going to work on it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And see if we can't smooth it out a little bit.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But yeah, it's way better than the gudg.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Coming in from also parts unknown in New England that we have Andy and not co Andy.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   How's it going?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   No, I just realized I'm wearing the sort of shirt that makes like technicians like you go.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Okay.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We need a shirt.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   We need other shirts because I'm wearing like no business.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And if I move just a little bit, it means that this is going to compress like crap.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And so that this is going to look terrible on YouTube.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You're just doing that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Now aren't you?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But I'm way too big a star.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So I'm going to say, excuse me.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   My designer says that tight woven checks are exactly what I need.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And so maybe you the nerds should figure out what your camera problem is because I don't solve camera problems.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We'll say, yeah, we okay.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's up to you.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We actually have a fair bit of news, I think it might.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And knowing that so we what we proved last week is that we don't need a lot of news.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We actually can you can give us just a little bit of news and we can stretch it for a very,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   very long time.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So we'll get we'll jump right into it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   One of the new one of the pieces of the news from the information that popped up Alex or Alex, not me, Alex Apple in early talks there in early talks.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   With NFL for the Sunday ticket games.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   What do we think about that and Renee?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So this is American football, right?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Not the one the Europeans were celebrating all weekend.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I was so much honking in my street all weekend.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   This is this is good old fashioned grid iron and it's not Canadian football with three downs, which is a kicking game.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's American football.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   The ticket is currently held by DirecTV.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So that this is their big NFL ticket that they make available.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So this wouldn't mean that Apple would take over NFL and you wouldn't be able to see it any other way.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   This would be what the what DirecTV has right now.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Andy, do you think this is this is a viable move?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, particularly now that they've real now that they've expanded Apple TV plus service to people who do not actually own Apple Apple hardware.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   This is exactly the sort of moves that you're hoping that they're going to make now that they're now that they can see a future in which they actually they're going to be starting to really charge for this stuff and cause lots of value.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   They also need a signature beyond Ted Lasso, which they don't have.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And so they're going to get all there's going to be a halo effect around the NFL because there are people who are just going to sign up or just going to relocate the Apple TV plus icon on their home page to some place.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's actually accessible instead of burying it all the way down to the bottom with the Buzzfeed news channel thing.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So yeah, the thing expecting this expecting this this fall to pray would not be until the end of the 2022 season is when DirecTV is actually when their contract expires.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Renee, do you think that broadcasters can actually compete with Apple and Amazon and Netflix and so on so forth as the bidding continues with all the sports?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah, I think one of the advantages they have is that the US sort of relaxed their antitrust regulation when it came where their regulations in general when it came to broadcasters so they can more tightly integrate.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   In Canada, we've had the cable companies owning the broadcasters for years now so they create their own content and still a lot of the content even what Apple's playing even Ted Lasso Apple's not producing that.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   That's coming from the companies that own the TV networks and the broadcast companies and they do they do bit amongst themselves.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But I think as this increases, they'll have their streaming options like we've seen with Paramount plus and Hulu and other things and they're just going to have to decide what the payoff what the return is from the big cable companies versus a return from their own streaming services.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Does Apple need it does Apple need a return? I mean, that's the coming from a from a monetary perspective.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That's the thing that's different with the streaming groups is that you're just trying to create value for your users as a, you know, it's it's more nebulous, you know, than you can describe.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Do you right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. There has to there has to be that tipping point where again right now Apple TV is the channel where you tune in.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You hit that up to see that show that you are interested in that happens to be on Apple TV before you go back to Netflix or Hulu or Disney Plus that has lots of stuff that's kind of worth exploring because they don't remember they don't have a library of movies.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   They don't have a library of classic TV shows or anything like that. So anything that's going to bring people in and make them more used to using Apple TV and the fact that it's not going to be an exclusive as you say, it's just going to be they would be in the NFL would not be interested in giving all of their the majority of their NFL business to any one streaming source because remember they're all about audience audience audience audience and not even not even Hulu can deliver the sort of numbers that a network broadcast can possibly deliver them.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So yeah, I mean that this would be a very big get for them in a pivot point for the company, I think.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I think it makes sense in a lot of ways because it's also the as being the whole ticket, you're not talking about or you're by having to be the whole ticket, you're giving it to people all over the US and potentially all over the world, depending on how the distribution works.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So that might conflict with NFL.com but but they but it would definitely all over the United States, people will be able to watch whatever team they want.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's kind of the direct the advantage of the direct TV ticket is that you get the ability to watch your home team, but somewhere else. Do you think that this is a do you think this would be a hit to direct TV.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   The report basically says they were losing money on it. Sorry.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You had done question first. Sure. So like we've seen MLB do their own MLB app and direct and maybe NFL goes one day direct, but we've also seen like YouTube personalities like Jimmy Donaldson getting 70 million views a week on one of it like one video week 70 million views per video
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   on the night for Wolf getting 10 million videos a day, you know, seven days a week on her videos. Is there some world where either NFL goes on its own or we start seeing a rapid shift in what we consider to be big numbers when we see what some of these independent people are posting?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think that there's a couple things there. There are a couple things to unwrap as far as that goes. One is is that you're absolutely right that some of these.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now you have to look at those views a little bit sideways when people see raw views. These are raw views non-autot, typically those are non auto start over.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I think it's 30 seconds. Is it 30 seconds? Still 30 seconds or is it? Are they lengthened it? Jimmy gets 70 to 80 percent retention on a 15 minute video. So you have to factor that.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   That's very good. So yeah, so those, you know, an NFL game has a lot of retention. It is, but the numbers are massive. I mean, I think the broadcast numbers still are huge and it would be difficult to provide the NFL ticket makes sense because you have a couple million here and a couple million there and that's easier to manage.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It is one of those things that the hard thing about streaming live shows and MLB figured it out, but it took them a long time. You know, like, you know, they're not publicly available anymore. I mean, MLBAM is gone. It's part of Disney now.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And so doing that in Microsoft showed that streaming is not something that is always easy and turnkey. And so it is, it's very difficult when you start getting to those kinds of numbers, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million, especially when you run it across.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I believe that from what I heard, MLB is running 6 to 8 CDNs, you know, working off of different backup to the backup to the backup to the backup because there's nothing like having sport. Like there's actual money riding on the on the event.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So there's nothing like having sports fans upset that they can't see the stream. You know, and so there it's so it's it's a really high stakes game that even, I think Amazon had a hard time managing it first.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You know, when they when they got it, they that that was definitely their first outings were not perfect.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You know, so and so that's that's part of it is is really building up. Now Apple has proven and Apple has numbers.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   You know, I hear that Apple's numbers are pretty good when it comes to keynotes. And so they know what it takes to do that. So that's a that's a good start.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   But I think that that would also be a challenge. I think also for the most part, to your point, NFL has been maintaining ownership and doing more.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And more NFL dot com and the NFL ticket every year. I mean, they keep on pulling in more and more of that ownership and more and more of that control.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So they could turn that key anytime. I think so far their membership isn't big enough to compete with the kind of money that they're getting for this because this one, I think was one point something billion most likely will be higher on the next the next round and probably double.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And they have one of the few things that are that's must have TV, you know, Andy. Yeah. Yeah, no, exactly. And I don't think that it would be make.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I don't think it would make much sense for Apple to keep to keep this this license year after year after year, because as you said, it's really expensive.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And the expectations from the NFL are really, really high. But I do see it as a really good move to get people to get used to install the Apple TV app on their device.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Now that they now that they're going after not just people who have the Apple TV, not just the people who have Apple devices that have this app pre-installed on it as far as the FTC is willing to allow them to do for now.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   They need to get people to install it on Roku. They need to get people to install it on Android TV. They're there.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Need to get people to install it on their the TVs that they bought that have built in Roku built in app stores and things like that.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And that could be a really, really big thing that the NFL, the saying is you got you got these people now go get the other people as well.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's not just retention of your current audience. You have to keep expanding it and expanding it. And unless Apple wants to be a boutique sort of channel, this is the sort of thing they have to do.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And again, the NFL would be a huge, huge, huge feather in their cap and getting that done.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I think you'd also experiment. I think one thing we haven't seen very much is experimentation with other ways to around the content.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So once you start streaming something and you're in a street, the problem with TV is that when you have a TV channel and you're competing with everything else in that channel.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So you come into the game really fast and you leave the game really relatively quickly and go back to the programming that you had.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And streaming, you don't have that. You could have multiple streams. So for instance, you could have a regular broadcast stream that people are showing.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You could have a commentary version that's more players and more geeky. You could have a beginner's version that is playing it out.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And all of those things can happen in the same platform and you could make those choices over time.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And so there's a lot of places also when we've heard Apple talk a lot about high frame rate to keep on bringing it up.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And high frame rate generally is 120 frames a second. And sports is where that happens.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That's where it's probably the most valuable place for it. Go ahead, Andy.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Well, but the question is who's going to pay to produce all that content? It is a terrific potential for streaming.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   There are people like me that enjoy football but as sort of the same way I enjoy watching video games where I'm not here to talk about,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   "Oh my God, Riley's good. I can't believe to put in Riley because the button hooks, the button's going to be able to make up the tech jargon for football."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It would be great if they have a commentary that's on like an Enonco level which is, "Well, they're in trouble right now because they've got more offense than they have defense."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And we're asking you to have another commentary trick. All I'm getting at is that people have to pay for that and they have to produce that and you have to convince the networks
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and the NFL that it's worth putting their money in that.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Well, they don't put in their money into it. You can just pay them down.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Well, someone has to. Are you suggesting, which is also an interesting idea that the NFL will license a stream that's available,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   license a sub-channel on the NFL app that says, "Hey, look, if you're a trusted partner, we will give you access to four-camera feeds and an audio stream that you can then do switching from."
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You don't even need to do that. So we've done it. A bunch of us have done these informally. If you don't call the game, you're not doing anything wrong.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   So you can talk about the game. You just can't call the game.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's something that people have done a pretty... What you do is what we call a second-year experience.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   So how we manage... Inside of office hours, it's how we manage.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   We don't rebroadcast the Apple event. Everyone watches it however they want to watch it, and we just talk to each other about it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So if you have something in your ear, you can just listen to us talk about it while you're watching it.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   But it's not a... We're not calling the... I mean, in the Apple one, we're more calling it, but you don't have to do that with sports.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And a lot of it can be just... If you're hanging out with your friends talking about a game or hanging out with a bunch of people,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   you're not calling the game because someone else is calling it for you. You're just simply talking about it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that's a different thing. But the point is, if Apple buys that... If Apple bought the rights, they could do it,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   and I'm sure they could package those kinds of rights into what they were doing. So they could add those extra streams.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Also, again, if we look at the trajectory of an Apple TV that potentially goes to 120 frames per second, and then to 8K,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   you could theoretically end up with being able to see games two years from now, or two or three years from now,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   which would be the perfect trajectory for that format at a level that you'd never be able to see on TV.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And that would be football at that level only available on Apple TV would probably be the end for broadcast.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It would be crushing for that. It would be crushing for that. Yeah, go ahead, Renee.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Did you have something to hear?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I think that was... No, I think that was interesting. No, that was me. I'm very, very bearish on the idea of NFL or any major league sport in the United States.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Any sort of like an extinction event for network television, because there's a difference.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   We were still dealing with the problems of too many households that don't have access to broadband, period.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Not even like decent broadband, but they didn't have access to broadband.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   No, I'm saying that the great thing about over the year and the great thing about cable is that it goes everywhere,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and it actually works for everybody.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   When you're talking about the NFL, you're talking about the people who are betting $50,000 on the next kickoff.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   You're also talking about the person that had to wangle three or four hours off to get to watch this game with their friends from work.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Sure.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So, I don't think that's why I think that it's... We're going to have a lot more infrastructure.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Oh, yeah. No, I mean, and I think that at some point, we have to... I mean, probably not for this show,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   but we have to have a conversation about the fact that cable companies should be utilities.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   You know, like it's at this point, I mean, they're more impactful to most people than their phone line.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You know, so there's so many arguments for Google, for instance, being regulated as utility,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and Biden gets a second term.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   That could be the victory lap after we've reduced all these companies to like little little vermin,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   sort of like looking for scraps anymore than this can be brought.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I have no app on, so I won't know he did it.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Now, now Apple is also trying to...
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   You're just afraid of someone coming up with a calculator app that is so great that it makes Apple ashamed that they prepackaged the calculator app.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I used to talk about prepackaging later.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   We're still talking about media here. We're talking about media.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Apple also is...
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   One more reason.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Thirty-four nominations led by Ted Lasso.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Renee, why is this so important? Like, why do they even care?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   They're getting all these nominations.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I think for them, it's like credentialing.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   You know, they're relatively new as a streaming service.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's a very new business for Apple. They don't have a pedigree in this industry.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And they're definitely doing... They're not doing the Netflix play.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They're not doing a lot of these big catalog plays.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   They're doing high-value prestige, almost boutique content programming.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Some people like it. It's HBO. I think it's a little bit different than HBO.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But that's sort of a play, sort of necessitates that you get some fanfare and award fanfare around that.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   They want to be in those conversations about who's putting out the best shows.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So I think for them, it's just putting feathers in the cap at this point.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Andy, who do you think that they're playing to when they're trying to get these nominations?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I think they're playing to the producers, the directors, and the talent and the show runners
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   that they want to sign to the next big thing.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   There are only a few things that you can really offer any of these people that they really, really want.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   You can give them a bucket load of money, and Apple has that.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   You can give them a huge audience, which they don't have at this point,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   or you can give them prestige. You can say, "Hey, we can put them one letter closer to their e-gut."
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And also feel as though they haven't been given the run around the way that networks and even a lot of cable companies
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   are going to give them these days. So yeah, it's important, and it's a valuable thing.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And the thing is, it doesn't cost them really much money.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   An awards campaign, at least at this level, costs nothing like an Oscars campaign costs.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So it's like, it's easy money to spend.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Also in the news, the annual notebook shipments are likely to break records in 2021,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   but Google, who has been really ruling that for quite some time,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   is starting to slow down. Samsung and Apple look like they're at some of their highest growth.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Renee, what do you think is behind all that?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I think Apple got a big two things. I think the pandemic really juiced both iPad and MacBook sales in general,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   because a lot of people had to suddenly figure out home situations, not just for themselves and their work,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   but for their kids and studying at home and all of those things.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And it led to a lot of people upgrading or buying into laptop ecosystems.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And also Apple had a big boost off of the M1, which I know when we were talking about what laptops to get my God kids,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   it was just a no brainer because the combination, we could have gotten cheaper laptops for sure,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   but you didn't know where they were going to be from any point in time.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   You didn't know how many kids could plug in their laptops, because some of them were doing every second day
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   schooling and the situation kept changing. And just looking at those, my 15 hours of battery life,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   it's ridiculous in the performance that you got for that. And I think that was really eye opening.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It wasn't pulling the, it was the functional equivalent of the aesthetic of pulling the MacBook Air out of the Minilla envelope.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It was just, I can't believe it can do this and do this this fast.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And I think that turned a lot of heads and then the pandemic converted a lot of those purchases.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Andy, do you think this is a growing trend or just a blip?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I think it's a cyclical trend as opposed to a blip or a growing one.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   This is one of the things that was very, Apple had two things in their favor.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   The ability to actually ship computers that people really, really wanted.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   There's a lot of pent up interest, so that's going to be a big, big, big boost.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   The pandemic also was a big advantage because, again, a lot of people who could get by with sharing,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   having one laptop for all their three kids to share, now they really need to get something that's going to be
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   to get something that would work for each one of these people.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It's glaring that this report specifically calls out Samsung as one of the big winners in the sort of surge
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and not the Windows market in general.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It really speaks to how diversified Samsung's portfolio is when it comes to hardware.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So don't think that this is going to be, oh my God, we might actually now have like 18%, 15% of all desktops
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   in the world instead of just 12% or 13%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   But yeah, it's a good year and it just comes to show you that there's so much excitement behind the Apple platform
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   right now.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   The number of times where I've seen, I do keep up in postgroups for all kinds of different platforms,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   all kinds of different demographics.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And the amount of posts I've seen about people who are just thrilled, I always wanted a MacBook,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and now I finally got one.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   This is great.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   They've got their picture of their, the thing open and their first text document and things like that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   It really does speak of the feeling that this is a new chapter that's open for Mac and anybody who has
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   people who have been waiting for a certain number of years for some sort of sign from above
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   or at least Cupertino, that is finally time to stop waiting to upgrade or waiting to switch to Mac.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   This is now a good time to do that.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   They've finally got what they wanted.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   One, I think that also Google had a good, good year last year.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And I think part of the problem though for them is that the impact of a lot of teachers,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   a lot of it was education, a lot of teachers didn't know what to do with that,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   hadn't been pushed into that.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And I think some of it might have led to a little bit of an upset with Chromebook.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   So I know my kids just hate them.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Like they have two kids that are 11 and 13.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And it's not like they hate them a little.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's like my son would throw, if he didn't have to pay for it, if he did it, he would throw it out the back door.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Like as hard as he could.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Like he just hates them.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And I think that a lot of it is very limiting.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   One of the things we saw also in the news is the California State University
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   it's buying 35,000 iPads.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   So these are iPads with Apple pencils, iPad Airs, smart keyboard folio.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And I think that the, I mean, Renee would you agree that the keyboard makes a big difference
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   in the penetration of the iPad into the education market?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Yeah, I think the keyboard and the support that Apple added for it last year with the cursor.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   As well.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I think all of those things has made it, because the schools are about utility at scale.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And one of the reasons Chromebooks made such a big splash initially is that they were really cheap.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   They were really easy to manage and administer.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   They had really good identity for school boards.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   But they also could be used to take standardized tests, which was more of a challenge.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You know, given the amount of scrutiny, security, they want to put around those things.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And the keyboard made it a much more noble thing.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   It's like, yeah, you have your fancy tablet and up, sit down and take your test kit.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Check that box for them.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Andy, do you think that they're comparable or do you think that it is a, where do you sit
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   as far as the Chromebooks versus iPads?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   There's such different from a quality perspective.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   From a quality perspective, I don't think that anything under $400 is built as well as an iPad nothing.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And I think the same would, meaning the $329 or $300 for education iPad.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   The iPad Air, same goes for that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But when you start to compare, oftentimes we make the mistake of comparing the sort of,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   oftentimes we make the mistake of comparing the dollar, a sort of like middle of the range,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   low level iPad to the low level Chromebooks, not really taking into factor that this is
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   a $500 thing versus a $250 thing or $200 thing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   When if you up the price to about $500, you really can get Chromebooks that are pretty
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   much every bit as good as a $5, $6, $7, $800 Windows machine.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   So they're very, very well made.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   They're not as, they've got hinges and they've got keyboards and they've got track pads.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   They've got more parts that can fail.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But they're still extremely well made, not pro level stuff, but they're going to,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   they're going to, they're going to definitely survive a year or two inside someone's backpack.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   My concern whenever I see stuff like this though, is that we went through this in Maine early
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   on with the iPad where the state of Maine was really, really excited about the, about the
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   iPads in education and what the potential would be.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And they didn't stop to think, okay, but so we're going, we're going to get these iPads.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   What are we going to do with them?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   What curriculum do we have that is going to take advantage of this versus anything else that we can
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   possibly buy that's on the market?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And are they going to be as practically easy to maintain, to fix, to keep running, to monitor
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   as these other devices?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   So it's nice, but I'm wondering if you have that kind of a budget per student that would
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   easily work out to $500, $600 if you're talking retail per student and equipping these people.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Are they going to be happy?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Are these kids going to be happy with a 9.7 inch 10 inch screen?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Are they going to be happy with a keyboard that's kind of cramped and flat?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Are they going to be happy with not having a mouse or regular track bed?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The pencil does things that these other devices can't do, but are they going to be happy with
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   this versus, if you said, well, we're going to give you everyone a $500 or $600 Chromebook or $500
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   or Windows 10 notebook, is it possible they'd be happier with this if they got a bigger
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   screen, if they got something that was more conventional, something that for even just
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   a simple question of the be easier for gaming?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I think that one of the things that I found even 30, well, now 35 years ago was the fact
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   that I was on an Apple pretty early on and I was able to do graphics, had access to a
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   computer, and I found that being able to be visual about things, I got better grades,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   period.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Literally, I got better grades for less work because I was able to create stuff that no
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   one else could do, so everyone was typing.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And I think that one of the things that definitely gives Apple, the Apple products, an advantage,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   is the ability to communicate more clearly with more imagery, more animation, more video,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   so on and so forth, their creation devices as opposed to drone devices, which is what the
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Chromebooks, I mean, Google has all these little apps, but they're pretty clunky.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And I will say that the thing, the app that makes the most money for me, I work on a
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   lot of high-end apps, the apps that make the most money for me is keynote, like in it's
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   free.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And it is probably the most important app to know how to do as a student because you're
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   building things.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And we work on curriculum, and what for teachers and for students, kind of a more Mac-based,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   iPad-based, more creation-based is, as we start looking at project-based stuff, I think it's
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   going to be more and more important.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   But you are going to have to, if we're preparing kids for a life after 18, whether it's college
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   or any kind of workforce, part of it is going to be you're going to have to know Microsoft
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Office and not just the presentation part of it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Whether they're Office, whether they're -- I work on a lot of companies.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Like I work in like, bang, mostly, mostly my work in the last decade has been bang.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And other than Amazon, all of them run on decks.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Like they just, everything's about the deck.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You know, like show me the deck.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   At some point, they need to work with a spreadsheet.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Sometimes they're going to have to develop a spreadsheet in order to do these sort of things.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And there are written -- well, but of course, there's paperwork that has to be filed.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   It's not all about, again, a visual is just part of a balanced breakfast as far as I'm concerned.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The people that I --
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   It sounds like it.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I'm just saying, like I didn't see a written thing for a decade, you know, working for
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   a lot of these companies.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   You know, it's consulting for a lot of these companies.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It's all just one deck after another.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   You know that this is the idea that I have.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I mean, I know that we want to tell students the other things.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But the reality is that that capability and people who are able to make those have an
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   incredible advantage.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Like incredible.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Well, again, I just say it's part of a balanced breakfast.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I'm not -- I know that you've had a lot of experience in a lot of different places.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And I know that you have a very broad perspective on things, even beyond the things that you
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   tend to talk about on the show.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   However, not everybody is in a visual creative sort of industry.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Oftentimes, it's -- see this length of pipe?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   We have to figure out how to get these pipes from this port over here to this port over
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   there.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And I think it's a great idea to get these pipes from this port over here.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Anyway, quick, the UK market, if a court forces company to pay commercially, quote unquote,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   commercially unacceptable fee for technology used in its iPhones.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Renee, what is going on here?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Yeah, we have this interesting situation now where in order to create a standard, companies
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   are supposed to be able to make their patents available into a pool that is freely available
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and non-discriminatory.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   It's a whole essence of what we call "friend" in patents.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   But a lot of those companies want to become part of the standard and then really jack up
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   or dismiss the reasonableness and anti-discriminatory aspects of that.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So we've seen this previously with Qualcomm lawsuits where Qualcomm wanted, you know,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   percentage of retail price for a while on their devices.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And these are patents that are, as far as I can see, essential to the communication standards.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And they want a significant part of the revenue per device.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And Apple thinks it's a non-commercial.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Apple's arguing it's a non-commercial, viable amount because, you know, you can't have, like,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   a radio company saying we want 15% and the camera company saying we want 15%, the screen
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   company saying we run out of percentages.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's impossible to make the device at that point.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And this is something that I believe was dismissed in the US with the UK's leaning towards
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   championing it.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Maybe we shall have wide-reaching repercussions.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   A lot of people will sue Apple first to get money to sue other companies as well.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So it's not never purely an Apple issue.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So I think this is something that we're going to be careful about.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   If we want 5G and 60 technologies going forward to be available to everyone.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Part of what's at hand here, though, is also that the market, that the UK wants to, the
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Optus, the company that's suing Apple, wants revenue from the, not just from the UK for
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   that process, but global revenue of everything that Apple does with these technologies, which
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   seems -- And there are non-practicing entity, I believe, is the plate way of saying it.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   >> I'm not afraid to say it.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   >> The headline is a little bit misleading because when I saw this headline a couple of
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   days ago, I thought, oh, my God, it's Apple.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Is there a letter on Apple.com that I need to check out right now?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   All that happened was that it was part of a dialogue between the judge and the case and
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Apple's lawyers where they said, the judge said, well, look, I mean, you're arguing about
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   this, but it's not as though you're going to be pulling out of this entire market based
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   on this, and the lawyers very, very gently, without the least threatening tone possible
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   for something that sounds so big, said, well, I don't know that that's true.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And then he said, basically, what Renee was talking about, that comes a point in which
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   this is economically inviable, if we can't participate in a market where we're just
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   going to be losing money hand over fist, then we're just not going to participate.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   But yeah, it's something to watch, and it's another example of how messy international
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   laws are becoming with everything that's related to technology these days.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   If there's any organization that's ever trumped for, let's have one global government
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   that takes over everything, I think every trillion dollar company would sign up for that in like
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   10 seconds, because you mean that all we have to do is grease the palms of one group of
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   leaders, and then that's it.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Sign us up.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   We'll give you $500 billion to any campaign to let this happen.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   There are huge differences in the laws, like just even the simple ones, like America has
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   a freedom of speech, which does not exist internationally.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And actually governments want to regulate speech, and there's fundamental differences
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   in how the EU and the US want to regulate all of these companies, and they're going to make
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   their laws, it's going to be untenable for big companies, and there's going to have to be some
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   ways in the middle, which has barely happened, I think, in the past.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   That's going to be interesting.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And we can see some of it fragment and then kind of come back together.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   GDPR was a good example of you just kind of making up a law that first literally whole
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   website just stopped serving to the EU until they could figure it out, but then it's
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   slowly kind of, and now we're kind of used to it.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I think I'm one of those folks that turns everything off.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   So I take the time, every time I go to a website, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I've, you know, so.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   That's also, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Go ahead, no, go ahead.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   That's also something to keep in mind as all of these different debates and arguments happen.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And obviously the corporations have to have to debate this.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Public interest groups have to debate this.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Governments have to debate this together.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   But the thing is, it seems as though every time that one of these three sides says, oh,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   this will be the end of the internet or this will be the end of freedom or this will be
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   the end of being able to have a secure iPhone, that's in a sense, it might be sincerely felt
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   rhetoric, but that's still rhetoric.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   At some point you lose, and then you walk, you grab your bat, you go back into the dugout,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   you kick the hell out of the water cooler, you get, you get, you get your composure back,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and then you figure out how to, how to exist in this world in which this thing that you
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   fought against and that you think is wrong actually works.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And usually it works out.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Yeah, I mean, again, the GDPR thing was something that a lot of us complained about when it
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   first came out, like, oh, this is going to be a pain and turned out to be slightly inconvenient,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   but not a big deal.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And I think what it did really is, you're just really clear of how often you're being
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   pickpocketed.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   That's what I call it now.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Tracking is just pickpocketing.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   You know, like, here's a shiny thing, and while I pull something out of your pocket,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and that happens to be your information, so just do this thing.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   So I think that I'm more, you know, at all of these things.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I mean, one of the things that came up here is how Apple's privacy, private relay could
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   be the beginning of the end of fingerprinting on the iOS devices.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Renee, how does this work?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Yeah, private really is so interesting to me.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Clearly, it's not a VPN.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   It doesn't do everything that a VPN does.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   It won't give you location hopping, for example, so you can't watch Netflix, the UK, and it
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   also won't give you secure tunneling into your office, for example, if that's what you
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   want to do, so you can do your purple restore or whatever, as if you're on campus.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   What it does is prevent your ISP and whatever website you go to, and whatever data harvesting
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   companies are face-huggered into that website from knowing what your IP address is, what
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   the actual address of your computer is, and it, or sorry, to know what website you're
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   going to, and then it prevents the website in those face-huggers from knowing what your
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   IP address is.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   So it's basically shielding you on both sides.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.400]   It sends only a completely encrypted packet to Apple's relay server, which then decrypts
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.000]   the website address, hands it off to a second server, which no longer has your IP address.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   They have Apple's IP address, but they are the only ones who know the website address,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   and then they fulfill that request for you.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   So all that these websites are, so all your ISP is seeing is Apple, Apple, Apple, and all
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.480]   these websites are seeing is Cloudflare or Akamai, or Swiftly, or one of these other
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:31.280]   huge internet providers, and that removes their ability to say, for example, we know
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.080]   Andy Nocko buys his comics every Tuesday.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.200]   He also bought this Deadpool Funko pop and gave them his address, so we know that Andy
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.320]   on this computer has this address, and when he's at the radio station, he orders pizza,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.000]   you know, every second week, so we know that Andy also likes pizza, and they start to be
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   able to build incredibly detailed, regardless of whether you have a Facebook account or
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.120]   not, incredibly detailed shadow profiles of everything that you do, everything that you
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.360]   buy, every website that you go to, and this prevents them from contextualizing those
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.000]   relationships and knowing which is you anymore, because the IP address is always changing,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.120]   and the website's the server is always changing.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.840]   When you say prevents them or makes it harder, like it's-
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.840]   It makes it harder, because they also make deals with credit card brokers, and they do
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.680]   real world stuff that has your address and your credit card number and your phone number,
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:23.120]   so it really degrades their ability to track you online, though, to digitally surveil you.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   It seems like there's-
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   It's worrying a lot of people, Andy, about the direction this is going.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   Yeah, because you have an entire industry that's based on this technology on fingerprinting,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   and being able to follow you around from site to site, and that's-
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   You're taking these taps that are-
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   That were unrestricted, and now you're essentially giving them a data cap, you're saying that,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   "Oh, well, you used to be able to draw as much water from this reservoir as you wanted,
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   and I suppose that's why you decided to build four paper plants on the side of this reservoir."
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   We're telling you that now you might be able to get one-sixth of that,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   but your entire business plan was, but we thought we would have unrestricted access to user data forever.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   So, yeah, this is going to force a lot of people to regroup.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   I think that it's going to make things harder as opposed to make things impossible.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   They will find a way.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   Oh, it's- The only other side of this that I do have some sympathy for is that I just want to make sure
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   that it's still possible for the ideal relationship to still be in place,
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   where, again, if there is an information source, a new site, a web app, a service that I really, really like,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   that helps me out a lot, that I don't want to have to pay $11 a month for,
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   because there would have to be about $13, $14, $20 different, $11 a month I'd have to pay for.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:56.120]   I think it's okay for a website to sell advertising based on my presence on their site.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.120]   I think that it needs to be a negotiated piece, however, where the fact that I'm-
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   This doesn't make me into a rube.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Right, I mean, I think it doesn't stop people from running ads on their site
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   or even knowing how many people saw those ads.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   But it has to do with all the other information that has been gleaned from us while we do that.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   You know, like that's- If it's one of the tools that they use to make that more effective,
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   and again, it's a real- It's a real straight grab.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   It really is about, again, imagine that you don't have to own property, you just have to build on it.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   Well, you're going to- Actually, for years, my little- My little thought experiment has always been that,
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   "Okay, it's called the big bag of money theory."
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   That there is a big bag of money in the middle of a table, and the middle of the sidewalk,
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   with a sign on it that says that, "Here is a big bag of money.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   Take as much as you want, or all of it. It is not illegal.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   It is maybe unethical, but there's no prosecution whatsoever.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   That bag of money is going to be gone in two seconds."
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   And so when you have these unrestricted policies, it says,
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   "No, there is no limit to the amount of data you can steal from people."
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   Then people are going to try to steal as much data as possible because, again, big bag of money.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   Well, and I think that the other thing is that the number one is that it's not just going to advertising.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   The data that's being generated by us is being also delivered to companies like PlanetEor.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   We just have to always remember that that data is being bought by a lot of people for a lot of reasons.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   So it's not just- And the government has no enforcement.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   It's so good.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   So it's more intrusive than just ads, but also I think that a lot of times we've been kind of taken advantage of.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   This is why I think there's such a pushback and why people are so interested in this,
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   is that we had this problem.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   When I was at Sony, I worked in marketing there, and we just kept on noticing that CD-ROMs cost 44 cents.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   And cassettes cost 19 cents.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   I mean, with packaging.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   That was the cost in 1991.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   But what we were charging $10 more for the CDs than the cassettes.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   And the response first was, "Well, we have to pay the creators."
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   I'm like, "What's the difference between the creators up for the cassette versus the CD?"
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   It seems like it's pretty much the same.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   And then it just came down to what we can.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   And the fact that you could is why people stopped being a nice, you know, the user experience with the manufacturers became tough because they were charging so much for that.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   And so Napster came out and people just didn't care.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   They didn't care about that process.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   And I think that in this case, you know, we've been so, they've been taking from that money bag, our pockets,
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   that money bag is, you know, our data.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   That's our money bag, you know, that they've been stealing from.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   And they, you know, people are tired of it.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   And I think people are going to push back pretty hard.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   Renee, I can't see you.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   This is kind of an odd thing to do it remotely because we can't.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   I don't have a repunt.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:26.120]   But Renee, do you think that this is just the beginning or do you think Apple's where it needs to be?
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   How far do you think that this constricts?
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   Do you mean like in general or specific to this?
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   Well, specific to privacy.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   It seems like Apple's kind of this is like one of these slow, just a news pulling tighter and tighter and tighter on this process.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   So when you spend time with Apple executives, one of the most surprising things about them, at least to me,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.120]   because I used to work in the big data industry and I would talk to people from SAP and HPM and IBM and all those companies.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.120]   And I always felt like I was talking to used car salesman.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   Not to be offensive to them, but they had these bombastic announcing personalities,
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   knew very little about the technology and had no real moral stance on anything.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:12.120]   And when you talk to Apple executives, they are almost always exactly the same as when you talk to them on stage.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   That is who they really are.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   So when you talk to Tim Cook and ask about these things, you see that look in his eye, like the same look when he says,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   like, I don't give a bloody darn about the ROI when it comes to accessibility.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   This to him is a privilege of working at a company where he can make these statements and think things like privacy as a human right,
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.120]   and then act upon them.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   And I believe they have a huge level of passion.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   Like Apple knows they have to negotiate with Amazon when it comes to the rate that they have to give them for Amazon Prime on the App Store.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   But Apple just kicked these folks, like, right?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   They rush ambowed them when they found out they were using the enterprise certificates to get around the privacy guards in iOS.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.120]   And that would normally be a very delicate negotiation.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.120]   And Apple's like, no, this is the line.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   If you invade this, you're going to stop.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   I think Apple is going to be incredibly, incredibly serious about prosecuting this on their platform.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.120]   And I think it is a beginning only in that they have limited capacity every year to do more features.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:14.120]   Like, I think they have a plan for where they want to make iOS not as zero knowledge, but a completely you controlled knowledge system,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:20.120]   where you have the granular ability to share or not share what you want on that granular level.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   And they're just rolling out protections year after year as fast as they can to get us to that point.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   And that's maybe, like, we heard this year also, like, they're going to get rid of passwords and have secure tokens.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   Like, all of these things are part of, not maybe a grand plan, but a grand cause.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   And we're a few years out from seeing it really locked down.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   Well, and also when we see, you know, us possibly putting medical information, putting our driver's licenses, put other things in there,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.120]   all of those things become more and more important.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   You know, that platform of us feeling like we're secure, feeling like we're secure is more, becomes more and more important
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   as we have the opportunity to do that if that's part of the business model, Andy.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   Well, that's a totally different thing when it comes to medical information.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   And because there are separate laws in place to control what you can, what you can access, how they can.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   But that affects security, but not like what a data harvester can do.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   Again, then probably they can just go and buy what they want.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   But a lot of times it's indirect.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   So we're, you know, you're able to derive a lot about people and their behaviors and things that are, you know, that are,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   you can derive a lot about someone without them directly telling you what it is.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.120]   You don't need the medical information.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.120]   That's the point.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   The point is that we can cut, you know, using the device and basically cutting all the lines off means that all those indirect assumptions can be taken away.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   You know, from these organizations.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   It'll be semi-effective. It'll never be completely effective.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   I keep the good news, bad news that always give people who, all of us have probably at some point this,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   oh, this is how I know that Google or Apple is like, is listening in on my microphone because I was just talking to a friend of mine about this,
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120]   about, about, about Pilates.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   And the next day I get ads for Pilates all over everything.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.120]   I didn't search for Pilates or anything like that.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   And then I have to reassure them, oh, no, no, no, what they weren't list.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   I promise you they weren't listening to your microphone because that would like run down the battery in 10 seconds and you totally notice it.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   No, no, no.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   And all that happened was that you spent a day with a friend of yours in a friend's house and the advertising network knows that your friend is into Pilates.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:37.120]   And then because he was able to see that your phone was in proximity for a proud time, they guess that you probably talked about Pilates.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.120]   And that's why you mean that it didn't even have to listen to me to figure out what I'm doing?
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   I'm not being tracked.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   I'm not being tracked by planetary intelligence, not just by cameras and microphones.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   This is not helpful to them, but it's factual.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   But again, over time, if a lot of people are using that platform, that stuff becomes less and less efficient.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   I think that's the point.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   And we have to remember that in the whole, like, the world will end, which is we're hearing from a lot of ad had folks in Facebook, Facebook's very word, the world's going to end, is that we didn't have this 20 years ago.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   There was still an ad agency.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   There were still ads.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.120]   There were still lots of ads that existed.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   There was, evidently in the 50s, I saw some TV show about ad creation in the 50s.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   There was ads back then.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   In fact, there were ads, you know, 150 years ago.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   And yeah, they weren't as efficient.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   And maybe they don't need to be.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.120]   I mean, that's the question is, do they need to be that efficient?
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   Well, that's the question.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   We also had computers like 20 or 30 or 40 years ago.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   They weren't nearly as good as they are right now.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   The advertising product that gets sold to advertisers is so much, from their point of view, so much better now than it ever was.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Partly for reasons that are very, very pro consumer that I get so annoyed.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   There's not many of those things that are pro consumer.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   I mean, yeah, I'm saying in the sense that I'm disappointed every time that I'm on Instagram.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   And there's an ad for something that is absolutely something that I would be very, very much interested in.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.120]   And I was like, damn, I got to remember what it is.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   Go to DuckDuckGo to make sure they don't find out that I saw this ad and then wanted to know more information about it.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   Meaning that an advertiser doesn't want to just send 100 million ads to people and maybe get 50 people that are responding to it.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.120]   They want to target a small amount of ads.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   Exactly.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   I'm saying I just want to finish what I want to say about this.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   It's a good product for advertisers because not only can they feel as though they're targeting to exactly the people they want to target, but also they're getting specific highly granular information back on what was successful and what was not.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   Again, some of this is pro consumer.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   Most of it, I mean, I'd argue definitely, is not in our best interest because of the data collection.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   But what you're going to have to do is that you're going to have to tell the advertising industry that, guess what, you can no longer use your, it's like taking, it's like, for any one of us, taking away our phone.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   And our laptop is saying, guess what, now you have to use like an Apple two plus, you have to go back to the technology of the 70s because we screwed it up.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.120]   We started liking this too much.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.120]   And I think that, you know, overall the entire economy kind of wraps around that.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:19.120]   You know, I noticed that with my kids, my kids only had about three months of television, like regular television.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   And they saw a lot of ads and suddenly they're like, this is when they're informative years and there's a whole bunch of requests for a whole bunch of stupid things.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   And we took it away. We just took the TV away, went back to streaming and then all those requests went away.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:35.120]   So no one felt like they needed all those things when they weren't being constantly told about them.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   So I think that's the other thing is, do we actually as consumers need that?
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   Now we're going to next before we take a little break here.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   Coming up next, we're going to tell you how to install Windows 3.1 on your iPad.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   I know many of the listeners want to know how can I run Windows, the quintessential Windows 3.1 on their iPad.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   Before I was Mac Break Weekly, Alex, Andy, Renee in a moment.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   But first a word from our sponsor, Casper.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:07.120]   I am in Hawaii right now. I probably wish I were home sleeping on my lovely Casper mattress.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   Man, I love that Casper. It's a guarantee to a good night's sleep.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.120]   The new Casper cooling collection is amazing.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   Everything you need to help sleep cool all night.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   I know we're having some hot summer nights right now, but really all year long it turns out research shows.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.120]   Sleeping cooler means sleeping better.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.120]   That's why you're going to want Casper's mattresses with a new snow technology.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   Casper's hyper light sheets, Casper's lightweight duvets, Casper's breathable mattress protector.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   All of them designed to keep you cool and comfortable so you can't help but love your tomorrow.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   Make the most of tomorrow with Casper's new cooling collection.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.120]   Let's start with a wave hybrid snow mattress.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   The idea is it's designed to keep you cool for 12 plus hours.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   Pulling heat away from your body for sustained temperature regulation.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   A cool to the touch feeling and a much improved tomorrow.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   You know that great feeling when you put your toes down under the covers.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.120]   It's a spot you haven't been in. It's nice and cool.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   It's like that. Fresh cool.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   Better bedding makes for a better tomorrow.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   That's why Casper's hyper light sheets are also designed with an innovative grid weave to let air flow through.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.120]   For maximum breathability.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.120]   There's even a lightweight duvets.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   You still get plush comfort but also optimal temperature control.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   Not too hot and not too cold.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   Just right.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   Casper's breathable mattress protector completes the set by improving the coolness of the bed,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   even further allowing air to flow between the body and the mattress.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   All of these designed to work together to prevent overheating all night.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   You know you sleep better when you're slightly cooler.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   You don't want to sleep hot.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   Cooler sleep means better sleep. Better sleep means better tomorrow.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   That's right.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   As always Casper offers free shipping and free returns.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   We love our Casper mattress and Casper pillow and Casper sheets.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   Yeah, I get it all. I love it all.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   When it comes to a better night's sleep, Casper's new cooling collection as you covered.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   Focus on tomorrow.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   Let Casper handle the rest.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   Explore Casper products, mattresses, sheets, pillows and more.

[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   Casper, thank you Casper for supporting MacBreak Weekly.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   Thank you for supporting us and saving yourself some money by going to Casper.com/MacBreak.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   Now back to Alex in the show.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   As we said before, everybody, I really do think that Windows 3.1 was kind of the quintessential
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   Windows version.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   Now Harry McCracken has figured out our good friend Harry McCracken has figured out how
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   to actually get Windows 3.1. Andy, have you tried this?
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   I have the apps I haven't tried.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   I did read through it.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   What I love about it is that it centers on one of the most famous/infamous apps in the
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   Mac App Store, which is a DOS emulator.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:28.120]   It is a virtual DOS machine that you can download and install for $5.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   It's been on and off of the Mac App Store for a while because Apple,
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   is not supposed to allow emulators on the App Store.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   I guess they keep making changes every time Apple kicks a fuss.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   It actually works.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   This DOS emulator is designed so that to allow people to install and run DOS games.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:56.120]   But Harry McCracken decided, well, what if you actually get the installation
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   disks for Windows 3.1?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   It will create in the files app just a folder that will be essentially the hard drive.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   If you can get your hands on some actual Windows 3 installation disks,
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   and then simply copy the files into that virtual hard drive, so to speak,
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:28.120]   you just simply run the installer just as though it's like $19.99,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   and the damn thing actually installs.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.120]   Then you can install Windows games on it.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   You can run Minesweeper on it.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   You can get a SoundLab ad lib soundboard support by installing a driver,
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   otherwise you don't get the real good Duke Nukem music soundtrack.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   But yeah, damn thing actually works.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   Renee, do you see yourself moving over to Windows 3.1, upgrading, as someone would say?
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   Windows 3.1 was never my favorite.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   I came in hard to the system when it was like 95, 98,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   and then I rode that into XP before abandoning that Vista.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   So I think if Harry can get XP running on it, but like service pack 2
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   and a lot of the vulnerabilities were patched, I think that would be my sweet spot.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   I'd say I think 3.1 was the last version that I used every day.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   I mean, that I actually, it was kind of a very painful part of my life.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   I was working at the time, so I looked at it.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   I looked at it. I started having Twitch.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   It's 2, weren't they? It was like 30 disks to install Windows back in the day.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   Don't you want to run the Bill Clinton era version of Photoshop on your iPad?
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   That's the one I had to run too.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   2 was that?
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   256 Chase of Grey.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   Yeah, I was given, I had to give up an LC for a much more powerful PC,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   but that was the only way I was going to be allowed to get all the things I needed
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   when I was working at Prime Sports Network, and I used it.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   I did not have Photoshop on that.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   That's prepress in 1992. Not fun.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   You don't want to be seen.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   You don't want to relook that.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   Every service bureau was like, "You're using a what?
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   A what? You're using a PC for graphics?"
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   Yeah, that was back to that.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   I was using an Amiga.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:13.120]   I really wish that Apple would lift its ban on emulator.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   There are so many people who, again, we grew up with the Apple II.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.120]   We grew up with PC.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   I love it.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.120]   I think that Apple II and Apple II, I think they just make one that the Apple II emulator.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.120]   I think that would be great.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   Or even better than that, a system 6.02 emulator so that I can run HyperCard,
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   and I can run Notion.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:48.120]   I can run all of these really classical deaths because we humans are a weird species.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   That there are times that they're just like, for previous generations,
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   when you see a vintage car go by, these people just go nuts because it reminds them of exact--
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   It puts them right back where they were in their 20s or their teens,
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   and that was the greatest car ever.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   For some people, it's movies.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   They remember when this movie first came out and they took a date there and whatever.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   For a lot of us, it's like, I want to play Harrier Strike Mission.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   I want to play Shufflepuff Cafe.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   I want to work on some HyperCard stacks because it's fun.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:27.120]   It is nostalgia, but there's part of culture that just goes away because we lose the machinery
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.120]   that even allows these creative works to even exist.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:36.120]   A painting is a painting, a sculpture is a sculpture, but a game is not going to work
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.120]   unless the operating system and the hardware, or at least the emulated hardware,
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   that runs it, is going to work.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   This is a way of honoring history and honoring your past and reminding people
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   that everything new came from somewhere.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   I really, really wish that Apple would do that, or at least not get in the way of other people
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   who are trying to do that.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   I got an Atari 2600 emulator, like the box that Atari sells, that is not an emulator.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   I got a week of being able to crush my kids on a game.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   That was the only week.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   Then they passed.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   I just got his base invaders.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   The first time, first time, I just went to really high numbers because I had...
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   But that took...
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   That was a solid three or four years of hard training to get that good at space invaders.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   I was like, "Oh, I don't think I remember how to do this.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.120]   I don't remember how to do it.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   My fingers apparently still know what to do."
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.120]   There's a lower eptilium brain that has it stored back there somewhere,
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   and I just started playing again, so it was a good time.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   Now, Facebook put out a survey, and they asked a lot of folks about competition and so on and so forth.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.120]   We got to remember that this is paid for by Facebook, but they claimed that Apple
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.120]   and Google crowd out the competition with default apps.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   Andy, is it true?
[00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   It depends on who is analyzing this stuff.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:09.120]   They did commission a study from ComScore, which is a very, very well-regarded company.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   They put out their own independent reports, but they're also the company that you go to
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.120]   if you want to learn something about an industry that you want to participate in.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   A lot of journalists will also commission research from ComScore because they have the ability
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   to look deep into app usage habits.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   The study that Facebook commissioned showed, yes, absolutely pre-installed apps
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   tend to be used a lot more often than competing apps that are a third party that need to be installed outside.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   They backed this up with a list of rankings that kind of surprised you with all the different apps
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   that you thought were not necessarily the most popular things that might have ever been used on this platform,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.120]   but they are maybe suspiciously high on the list.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   Obviously, Apple immediately kind of took to the telegraph lines and said,
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.120]   "Hey, look, well, hey, obviously Facebook paid for this."
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   So, you know, when you want to think about that, also, the findings, the list of app usage that this study
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   supposedly published in late 2020 is contradicted by the same organizations' own release in April on popular usage of apps.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.120]   And that is valid, but it all depends on what kind of data you put in and what kind of math you run on it.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   Apple doesn't point out, for instance, that what the Facebook supported research included was,
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.120]   "No, don't just let's not just take a look at commercial apps that have one-to-one correspondences.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:48.120]   Let's also look at services. Let's also look at built-in apps for browsers, for chat, for all these other things."
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   So, I think the data is interesting. It's not conclusive.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:59.120]   It can't be simply dismissed out of hand, but we definitely need third-party statisticians and analysts to take a look at this data.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   Again, fortunately, this wasn't just -- this isn't like the Arizona recount, where they just got --
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.120]   they just basically got a Craigslist to add out for someone who knows how to do an election recount and said,
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   "Oh, good luck with you." They do have their paperwork, they do have their receipts in hand,
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   and they will be able to defend what they said and put up to scrutiny.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   Well, I guess the question is for Renee is that it doesn't matter.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   I mean, I think that the issue is, I look at my parents, my dad got an iPhone.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   The only thing -- the only apps he still has on that iPhone are the ones that -- there's the Apple apps,
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   and I think Flipboard, because I put Flipboard on. He uses it every day.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   But outside of that, there's a lot of people that buy these phones, and they just want the phone to do the thing.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   Like, in a lot of these apps are pretty innocuously like, "This is what you actually need to have a phone be full-featured when you buy it
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   without having to do anything else." Renee, does that make sense, or should they be installing other people's apps?
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120]   How should that work?
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   The whole thing is bizarre. I've had family members who for years only use the iPhone as basically an iPod that made phone calls.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   Like, they would use the Music app, they would use the telephone app, and they would maybe check the web every once in a while.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.120]   That was all -- didn't even download games, and the people who really want a game, they would maybe use a couple of different --
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   they wouldn't even use the phone app, they would maybe just download their favorite games.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   So there's a huge amount of different use cases. The really weird thing right now going on is we do have people who seem to want to remove all baseline functionality.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   Some of them even joke -- not even jokingly, but ignorantly have apps like you shouldn't have a store on the phone to get other apps to put on the phone.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:44.120]   Like, it is completely callous to just the end user. Like, these things would be blank slates completely unusable to people.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   And the other odd part was the attorney's general going after Google saying that because Apple says they're a console, they're fine, but because you don't say that you are, now we're going to be twice as hard on you.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:07.120]   And just the amount of -- I want to say -- I didn't like the way I wrote word for this, just stupidity and lack of coordination and lack of consistency in going over these things.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   And it reflects no reality of the market that I can see. I've been reading everybody, Ben Thompson, Ben Evans, like all the bends, Ben Beherrin.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.120]   Like, every single bend I could find. I've been reading, Carolyn and Ben Evans, just all the good analysts.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.120]   My middle name is Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben. Lindsay. I just want to know that, yeah. Ben Kenobi.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   And no one seems to understand, like, the underlying -- or confine any underlying logic to any of this, which I find is particularly egregious and entertaining at the same time.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:41.120]   Yeah, when you look at these lists, like, on the -- they have it split up for iOS and Android apps, that's hard to compare because with iOS, you are talking about exactly one platform and exactly one piece of hardware.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:50.120]   Whereas on the Android side, they don't split it out for, well, what do Samsung phone users use? What do Google phone users use? What do other manufacturers use?
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120]   So when you look at the iOS --
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:05:00.120]   Hey, watch out phone users. Yeah, exactly. It's like, okay, well, iOS, the top one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight apps are Apple apps.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.120]   So we're talking about the Apple phone app is the most popular app on iOS.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:11.120]   Okay, well, hard to argue that there's going to be a problem with competition there. Apple weather, Apple photos, Apple camera, Apple clock.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   Then YouTube gets the -- like, the number nine position, then Apple news, Apple calendar.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   I think they're upset that Facebook is underneath there.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:30.120]   Whereas when you look at Android, Facebook ranks much, much higher, but once again, the reason why the phone app is not in that same top 15, top 20, is because, again, there's no --
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   there's no -- it would be in the same position on a Google phone if it were just breaking out for platform by platform by platform.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   So like I said, there's a lot that needs to be sort of unpacked here because the methodology doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem biased, but it doesn't necessarily seem as though it's the sort of thing you can look at a chart and go, "Ah, ha!"
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:06:00.120]   And just know that Facebook is hoping that that's exactly what people are going to see when they see Apple, the word "Apple" in the first 10, 20 slots of the iOS chart.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.120]   Yeah, and I think that also, there are big complaints, of course, is that there's a messages app instead of messenger.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.120]   So we would like to have your information. So we don't think anybody should have one that doesn't provide that information.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:19.120]   Like, we don't want you to have a choice that's already built in that just lets you talk to people without actually having to share, like, everything with the cloud.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   So that's a cloud, Renee.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   Yes.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120]   For sure.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   I have a question.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120]   Just for those of you watching --
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.120]   Howard Johnson is right.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   So for those of you watching, here's the issue is that I have a disadvantage over what Leo normally has, which is that I'm kind of flying blind.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:47.120]   So when I only see myself talking, I can't see any -- I don't have any non -- you guys can cut this out later.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.120]   I just don't have any -- I don't have any non-verbal cues.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:57.120]   And so if I hear something that I think is Renee, I kind of stack up and throw it at him or Andy.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   And so I'm kind of -- I'm kind of depending on like, I feel like a blind person depending on little grunts and hiccups.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   And I'm worried about interrupting you because I'm not sure you're finished yet. So I'm waiting to make sure you're absolutely done.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   Renee finishes his -- it clears his throat. I'm like, "Okay, it's going to Renee next."
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   And I'm just like -- All I care about is -- I'm Centro Square just like Paul Lind. I'm the star of the --
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120]   [laughter]
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   Anyway, going back to your point, I think it's really interesting.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:28.120]   It's super interesting that -- and people talked about Apple's share locking and Google's share locking companies or --
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   and Facebook has famously been doing this too.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   With Instagram, they've been taking features that are popular in other apps.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   Like they basically subsume Snapchat and they just announced that they're going to be turning Instagram away from photos and into a TikTok clone.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:48.120]   I know it means they're innocent in this, but the thing is that we're still seeing a very vibrant, very competitive market.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   And that's important for two reasons. It allows people like me who want to have a tailored experience.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   Like I use PCALC. I use Halide for my camera. I use Carrot Weather. I don't use a lot of the default apps,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.120]   but I have a lot of family members who don't care. They just want the very basic functionality.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   And the idea of stripping all of that off a phone and saying, "Okay, now you either need to go and get a free app
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   from one of these data harvesting companies that will take all your personal information,
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   or you're going to have to pay -- I pay 10 bucks for PCALC. I would pay 100 bucks for PCALC. I pay 10 bucks for TweetFot.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   I pay for care. I love those things, but it's not fair to say that everybody has to spend $200 resoftwaring their iPhone or Android phone every time.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   That's a bum deal for consumers. So they have to be very careful what it is they're actually regulating
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   and maybe figure out the end game and then engineer backwards rather than just making all this bluster
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   for political points every time I get a microphone shot.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:53.120]   I actually think the problem with this whole thing is that it actually shows something -- so I don't see Apple maps on that top list.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   Do you see that? Unless I'm missing it.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   Nobody uses it, Alex.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   Nobody uses it.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   But the point is that Google maps is on the Android side, no maps, which is a little odd overall because a lot of it will use maps on their phone.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   But the point is that by itself, maps being pre-installed hasn't meant that everyone's using it.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   Because most of us -- I put Google maps on and I put it on the front screen.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   I don't know where the Apple maps is. The Apple map shows up when I click on an address in messages, it pops up.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   I'm like, "Oh, there's Apple maps."
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.120]   And I'm like, "Oh, it's kind of good and kind of nice."
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   But on my day-to-day basis, I don't use it.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   But I think that when I look at the top list, I'm like, "Oh, why would you -- I guess my thing is the phone, the weather, the photos -- you would want these to come with your phone."
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   I think most of those came with my trio.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   You know, like it's not -- a lot of our argument was --
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   It's a Java to a Mepone.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   For a lot of us looking back, a lot of us -- when we look back, Apple released a phone, had a bunch of apps, and we all complained that we couldn't write apps for it because we had other things we wanted to do with the phone.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.120]   Like, that was the whole point, is that I don't care about the photo or the thing.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   I want to be able to build other things because my phone could do all these other things, and that's what I want to do.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   And Apple said, "Okay, well, we'll give you an API to write other things for the phone."
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.120]   And I think that -- and then people made some of these even better.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120]   I think there's a lot of camera apps.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:40.120]   Filmmik is probably the most -- for me, the most used video tool that I use over photos.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:47.120]   But I think that, you know, there's millions of apps that are something other than these.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   Just seems like -- I don't know if it matters if that happens, Andy.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   I do like the discussion, though.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:05.120]   At one extreme, yeah, it's absolutely silly to insist that every phone, ship as a totally blank slate and you have to install everything that you need to --
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120]   It should be a horrible user experience.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   It should be horrible, doesn't benefit anybody.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   And also, it's not as though there's a lot of competition for like an Apple Stocks app.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   That's fine.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   But however, there is a happy medium here.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   It is a very, very good discussion to have, where Apple is making money off of services, where they're charging money for a subscription music app.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:35.120]   Is it really correct that their commercial add-on subscription music app comes pre-installed?
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:43.120]   But if you're running Spotify, if you're running something else, you have to -- the user has to find out about this and actually go out and get it.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120]   I don't know.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120]   Maybe, maybe not.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   Is it okay that Apple took so long to give us an alternative for simple defaults?
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   Like, I mean, the Apple Mail app, I haven't really used that in years.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   It's always been outlook for me.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   And the fact that it took so long for Apple to let me designate a different browser or a different mail app, I would like to have a different messages app if I want to.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:16.120]   If my default messages isn't actually an SMS or an I-message-based app, but it's actually -- no, I actually happen to use this -- I happen to use a signal as my regular messaging app, and I want that to be my default.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   It's a worthy discussion to have that is Apple and Google, are they leveraging their dominance in this industry to pre-install apps that really absolutely favor them over everybody else?
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:47.120]   I don't necessarily -- I don't necessarily -- I'm not necessarily able to tell you what the answer should be right now, but I do want these companies to have to answer pointed questions instead of giving out press releases and a lot of really odd arguments about -- no, this is Apple.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   This was never about having a calculator app.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   Why should Spotify have -- Spotify suffering by virtue of the fact that's not free sold.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.120]   Spotify -- we can't remember that Spotify wouldn't exist without the phone.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:13.120]   Like when we -- in Facebook probably wouldn't have been nearly what it is without the phone, but Spotify wouldn't exist at all.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.120]   They got the APIs and did nothing with it.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.120]   They were complaining to the EU that they weren't allowed to use these features.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.120]   Apple gave them these features a year and a half ago. They still don't use them.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   Right.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   And so I think that there's a little bit of a -- and, you know, Spotify's got all its own -- its own problems.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:40.120]   And so I think that -- I believe that iTunes or music has been literally on the phone since day one.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:47.120]   Like most of these apps -- I don't know if there's that many new apps that have been added -- have -- what has been added since almost day one?
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.120]   Like since they opened up the app store, what has been added to the app?
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   It started pre-installing the iWork apps, but I think they've gone -- they've vacillated back and forth on those.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   So literally these have been from -- sorry, say Apple News.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   Apple News, Apple Notes after a few of them, but your point is well taken.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   Yeah, I mean, this is the way it's been since the beginning.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   And Apple has made no changes -- almost no changes at all.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:19.120]   And they don't install a lot of -- I guess my big complaint for a long time was like I couldn't uninstall stocks.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.120]   Like I didn't care about stocks, and so that was like -- I was like, really?
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   But I'm a freelance journalist. Stop rubbing it in.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.120]   I don't have stocks. The old Somi stocks. I can't afford stocks.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.120]   I want an app called Stonks. Stonks, yeah.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.120]   Don Perishable fee. That's my investment.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.120]   Why doesn't somebody have an app called Stonks? It's just Stonks photos.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:47.120]   My kids show me a lot of Stonks. Anyway -- oh, my gosh.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.120]   Anyway, sorry. We're not going to go down that rabbit hole, but Stonks is great.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   Now, evidently, the court dismisses a lawsuit alleging signing with Apple in the App Store Stifle Competition.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:10.120]   And this is made by the Blue Mail developer Blix claimed that Apple was engaged in monopoly-like behavior in favoring its own apps over third-party competitors.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   Exactly what we were just talking about. The court dismisses it.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.120]   And what's important is that we understand what dismiss means.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   This doesn't mean that the court sided with Apple.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.120]   The court said there was so little information. We're not going to bother working on this anymore.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   Andy?
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:32.120]   Yeah. This was -- so apparently the lawsuit came on two different bases.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:41.120]   One was about signing with Apple, which they felt infringed on their own patents.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.120]   Another one was basically that, like just as you said, that there wasn't enough competition.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   That this was giving Apple a -- this was given too much of a leg up.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:16:01.120]   But the judge kind of slapped this down, like you said, not because they made a judgment on the rightness of the argument,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   but they basically said that, "Well, the thing is, you're claiming that Apple is doing something that you have not demonstrated that they're actually doing."
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   That they even have the ability to do. They're saying that from a quote that 9-5 Mac has pulled out,
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   "Allowing competition is the opposite of unlawfully constraining competition."
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.120]   So again, Blix has failed to state a claim.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   So what they're saying is that they haven't actually shut you down.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:34.120]   They have just simply added themselves to the menu of options that are going to be inside every single app.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   And again, I think that I utilize the app signing with Apple all the time.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   I'm very happy that they put it there.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.120]   Renee, do you think that there's any issue with signing with Apple?
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:51.120]   No, I think there are a member of the Coalition for App Fairness.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   We've talked about this so often.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.120]   I believe there's major reform that's necessarily an app starting.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   It's an incredibly serious issue and I think it needs to be addressed.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.120]   But the companies involved in that coalition of app fairness are just so routinely the absolute worst.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.120]   They hire the worst lawyers, make the worst arguments, behave in the most egregious manners.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   And basically just say, we don't really care about the rest of you.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   We'll say we want to help independent developers.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   But screw those guys. We want to be their gatekeepers.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120]   We want to replace Apple and Google and be their gatekeepers.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.120]   And it happens over and over again.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   I think this is Blix's second tossout here.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   I don't know if there's any slap penalties at any point for bringing lawsuits that were as immature as this.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   But it would be farcical if it didn't both annoy me and not solve the problem.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.120]   When I looked at the coalition, I was like, who isn't that coalition?
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.120]   I saw a bunch of billion dollar companies and a bunch of companies I didn't know.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.120]   It's like billion dollar companies just want to be the billion dollar companies.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   I was like, I was like Spotify and Epic collected a bunch of people so it wasn't just Spotify and Epic.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   People who yell along on Twitter but then lose on third of their employees.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.120]   It's a real good mix of different.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   Oh yeah, base camp. I forgot about that too.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.120]   Yeah, those are the three big ones.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   And then let's get a bunch of other people.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.120]   So it's kind of like having a coalition when you have one person from the other side, which is kind of, you know, not really true.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.120]   So anyway, we'll see how that goes.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   Apple has lost an appeal in a Fortnite court battle.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.120]   No, no, this is in Australia.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   So, no, this doesn't mean that Apple lost anything yet.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:27.120]   This means that they lost, they were trying to basically say that Epic cannot sue them in Australia
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.120]   because they signed an agreement that said they can only sue them in California, which Epic doesn't seem to,
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120]   legal agreements don't seem to be that important, Epic.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.120]   Renee, what's going on here?
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   No, it's, again, it's part of this whole, you know, Epic wants to be able to have their own App Store.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.120]   That's their end game here.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:49.120]   It's been clearly stated in their lawsuits since the beginning that they want to be able to have not just not pay Apple to be on the App Store.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.120]   They want to have and not just their own App Store.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.120]   They want to have an App Store on Apple's App Store so people can easily find that, install it and then move their ecosystem,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   all their developers, use their platforms into their own App Store.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:06.120]   And this, again, is like, again, to your point, they don't really follow the agreements.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.120]   They believe the agreements aren't fair.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   The thing about Epic and Apple to some degree is that there's just as callous disregard for the users.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   Like all these people who want to be playing Fortnite on their iOS devices and can't because Epic will not agree to have all of this money and all of these issues put into a trust until the end of the agreement.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   So they're suing Apple in every jurisdiction they can to try and get whatever foothold they can, hoping that one of them breaks in their direction.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.120]   And I guess, I guess, I don't know, is scale on their side?
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:37.120]   Alex, if they sue in as many jurisdictions as possible, is it more likely for them to get at least one win?
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.120]   You know, it's if you spin the wheel a bunch of times, you might find somebody that's willing to.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:51.120]   Because, you know, the rules in the United States, I mean, the reason that Epic and Spotify and other people are, you know, just hoisting dollars into Washington, D.C. right now.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:20:02.120]   And I'm constantly talking to everyone and getting these little kids that are writing these laws to put those in is because, you know, they can't win in the courts because that would require evidence.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   You know, like, you know, like it would actually have to follow a series of rules in the United States.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   Those rules are much more lax in other parts of the world.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   So the EU is kind of like, oh, whatever we feel like we will do.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:20.120]   In the United States, you know, the problem is is that the court system here requires evidence and procedure and they can't win there.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.120]   They don't have a case.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   So, so I think that that's going to be the problem.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   So you'll see them probably go to the EU and go to Australia and go to other places that are a little looser with the law than the United States.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   Andy, do you think it's going to go anywhere?
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.120]   Probably not in the United States.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   I really think that at some point there's at some point, both these parties are going to realize that this is just too much time, too much money.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   Neither side is going to get exactly what they want. Apple wants vindication that the way that they've been running the app store in perpetuity is divine and without blame.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   Epic and these other game manufacturers want the ability to put whatever apps they want through whatever store that they want without paying a dime to anybody.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.120]   Neither one is going to get what they want.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   At some point, they're going to realize how expensive all this stuff is.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:19.120]   Time and time again, the biggest lawsuits have been settled pretty much with a ceasefire as opposed to a clear victory.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:27.120]   I think Samsung Apple is one of the few where you can say that they ran this ball all the way to the end zone.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120]   And one side could say they won.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.120]   One side can say that they lost.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:38.120]   It's going to be difficult because the difference between running this lawsuit in the United States versus Australia is that Australia is that Australia is going to be able to get it.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   Australia has a much, much more jaundiced view on big tech than most other countries do.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   This is the area in which if there's an opportunity to slap a huge tech company down through a law that makes sense or a law that is absolutely unenforceable and unpractable, Australia is where these things tend to happen.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   So this is a good, this is very good news for Epic because they are finding a very, very favorable audience for these claims they're making.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:16.120]   I think Australia has already declared on some level the consumer protection organization has already said that Google and Apple have an unfair advantage in their app stores.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:21.120]   And this is something that can be piggybacked with awful hot and different legal arguments.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   One thing I wonder about is I was thinking about it like if Apple had to put a store in, it doesn't seem like when it comes to fairness, it doesn't seem like they should have to provide their libraries.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:42.120]   If you want to use a store outside of the app store, like Apple is putting all that in, they're providing all of that because you're building stuff for their app store.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:52.120]   It seems like it would be fair, like even Steven, to say you can use, I mean Apple shouldn't even have to provide you Xcode at that point.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:59.120]   It's like why would they're giving you something that's free because you're producing use for their product if you're just a leech?
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:04.120]   Why would they have to provide you any support or anything to make that work?
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.120]   That's a great argument. I'm going to pretend that I'm, that's a great argument.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.120]   And we absolutely, as Epic Games and third party app developers, we absolutely accept the rightness of this.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:24.120]   This also means that legally Apple, you have to give us the right to get to code all the way down to the, all the way down to the metal.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   So if we want to run code that you don't approve of, you have to give us all the secrets on how to run our own app store, how to run our own app development kit, how to drop this on the screen, how to do our own stuff.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   You can't see that otherwise you could argue that Apple could give them a base of like this is the basic stuff that you get to use from what we're doing, but like our AR stuff is not something we're going to give you.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   Like that, you know, I want to give you all toolkits.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:24:01.120]   And Google's already doing that. They have by separating base Android, which is available to everybody for free versus what you could call Google Android, which is the stuff that everybody wants, the stuff that actually makes a competitive with the iPhone.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.120]   But I'm not sure, I'm not sure it says, it's as easy as that.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   I really don't think that, I really don't think that in Apple's, in the iPhone's case, anything is to really, really to be gained by allowing external app stores only by virtue of the way that you're going to be able to use it.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   And by virtue of the way that the iPhone is set up and the way the ecosystem is set up, I think that there is some wiggle of room on how they choose to run the app store.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:42.120]   And this is another area in which I'm just glad that Apple executives are going to have the obligation to sit before a panel of people and explain and defend their positions, as opposed to simply making a statement at a keynote and then waiting for the applause.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:48.120]   And we decided to make this change that affects all of your lives. You're welcome.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:57.120]   Well, and but I do think that for the most part, I mean, as a longtime Apple user, I find that most of what they're providing on things that I want.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:07.120]   You know, like it's not, you know, and I get, I think that one of the things is missing in a lot of the arguments when we talk about, when they talk about competition, what I hear is fragmentation.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   Like, that's all I hear. Like the only thing as a user that I hear is you're going to fragment what I have, you know, and, and I think that what's left out of these arguments, whether it's legal arguments or so and so forth, is this is essentially a battle among billionaires.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   Right. These are, this is a billionaire. This is Spotify and Epic and Basecamp and, you know, a bunch of billionaires that are all fighting over something and not really, they don't really care about the user at all.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:40.120]   Like we just have to remember that like they don't, if you're an Apple user, they don't care about you other than your money. Apple doesn't care about the user.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   Apple, Apple is a business they make. No, I'm saying, no, I'm saying.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   They're entire business is the user. Like that's the whole thing is that they're the only company we work with that their entire business is that is taking care of the user.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   You know, like they're that they don't, they don't have an advertise, a really viable advertising business. They don't have any of these other things.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:11.120]   Their only job is to make it better for you because that's their business model. Their business model is actually to make our job to make what we do simpler and easier and more secure.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:19.120]   I mean, that is, it's, I don't care whether they, I don't know if they like us or not. But what I can say is that they're the only ones that are, that that's the clear business model of what they're doing.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:29.120]   You know, like that's the business, their business, their business model is to so hard. So long as they just like almost every other company Google included, they will do everything they can to take care of their users.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   And to increase the user experience and make their products more valuable and more essential to users so long as it doesn't screw up where they're making their money from.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   And Apple on that basis, Apple is no different from any other company. This is the, this is the, the yin and the yang of Apple and Google is that Apple doesn't quote, doesn't care about the users because they're not interested in, they're not interested in creating value for money.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   They're not interested, they're not interested in giving users choice. Whereas Google just gives away all the operating systems and gives away Google maps and gives away free email to everybody on the flip side.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:18.120]   The flip side of that is that Google doesn't care about its users because it has to keep, it has to find a way to keep that ad revenue rolling in and making these profiles more and more valuable.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:29.120]   And so, we're at Apple, we don't care about, we realized that from the beginning, we made this principle that although we had these opportunities to make money off of monetization of our user base, we decided not to do that.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:39.120]   So I'm just, I stopped just short of saying that Apple cares about its users on the large level of there are two trillion dollar company that they would, they would take half of that money.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:51.120]   And so, they would totally chuck the China market into the sea because they don't feel as though that what they're doing, what the Chinese government is making them do is, well, no, exactly there.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   They're willing to do certain things because they give the same thing in China that you hear.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.120]   I mean, if you make requests for the servers here, you'll get the same thing.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.120]   Like if you ask for people's information in iCloud, you'll get it in the United States or China. It's not like it's not any different.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   If you ask for the phone, they won't. That's the distinction.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   If you ask them to make sure that people, individual citizens cannot have secure communications, see what happens.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:23.120]   But the phone, I don't think China has gotten attached to the phone yet. Go ahead, Renee. You can't.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   Yeah, no, I mean, we're living in a, I always try not to make this a China thing because China's by no means alone in a lot of these regulations.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:39.120]   And it's called too fast. China, well, it's Russia, Turkey too. But I mean, just when you remove the totalitarianism from it, I don't know.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   I don't want to get canceled by China. That's rough.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:47.120]   But like Apple is facing a world where they're increasingly talking about data repatriation.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.120]   France, famously, a lot of people, and as much as a lot of us love America, after the Patriot Act, a lot of countries said,
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   "We don't want our data being stored anywhere near you people either." And there's a lot of countries that don't want their data stored on American servers either.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   Even if they're not like a China, Turkey, Russia kind of country, they just don't trust the US government and they're going to force companies like Apple and Microsoft.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   Microsoft's been litigating this for years already to store their stuff on the land of the country whose citizens that data is.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   And then you're increasingly having countries like Australia, which we were just talking about trying to break encryption en masse, like basically enforce back doors.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:26.120]   I think China is especially aggressive about this and they have the power to push these things through much, much more quickly and without very much resistance.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:33.120]   But Apple has to store Chinese citizens data in China. They're going to have to store increasingly EU data in EU data centers.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:40.120]   And it's just the very beginning of this very, the internet made us one big world, but we're incredibly provincial about it right now.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.120]   That's what I'm trying to say, I guess.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   More Mac news in just a minute. But first, Leo's got a couple words for us.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   Let me interrupt one more time, Alex, Andy Renee. I've got in my hands. I'm very excited. I've got some lovely Sennheiser earbuds.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:03.120]   I am a big fan of Sennheiser. Now I know you're listening to Mac Break Weekly. You probably think the AirPods are the latest, greatest state of the art.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.120]   Can I make a recommendation?
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:13.120]   There's one name that for almost 75 years has been the best name in sound. It's Sennheiser.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:18.120]   When it comes to the things I put in my ears to listen, it's all about sound quality, right?
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:23.120]   You've got to check out Sennheiser's. They make the best earbuds money can buy.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:30.120]   Scott Wilkinson recommended a couple of months ago that I take a look at the Sennheiser wired earbuds, the IE 300s.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   And these are literally, quite literally, the best earbuds I had ever heard. I mean, they sound so good.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.120]   I've taken these on the trip to Hawaii. But on the airplane, I want to go wireless.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.120]   And these are the new Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2s.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:52.120]   These are completely wireless Bluetooth and they sound great.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:58.120]   You know, for 75 years or other companies have focused on phones or tablets, Sennheiser's put sound first.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:03.120]   Sound is what Sennheiser is all about. They make the best earbuds you can get.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   And these Momentum True Wireless 2s, they sound better than the AirPod Pro.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.120]   They give you the best listening experience. They fit in your ear beautifully.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   With their free smart control app, you can adjust the sound of your personal preference.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   With the built-in equalizer, you can also choose the tip that fits your ear the best you want a good seal.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   And for the airplane, the active noise cancellation, I'm so excited.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   Switch off your surroundings, dive into that impactful song or important episode
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:37.120]   with a new active noise cancellation feature. I have to say, they also look, you know, they kind of look elegant.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:43.120]   You can fly all the way to Australia and still be going strong.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:47.120]   You can feel the quality of Sennheiser earbuds the second you put them on.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:52.120]   And I have to say, nobody makes better headphones. And I will stand by this than Sennheiser.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:57.120]   They have the best, whether it's wired or wireless headphones I've ever used.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:00.120]   And I think they do the absolute best Bluetooth ever.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   Sennheiser called them a "true wireless" too.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   Clearly superior sound quality to the AirPods Pro. I would agree 100%.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   They also said they're the earbuds to get if you value sound quality over everything else.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.120]   You could tap them, get Siri to respond to you, pick up calls, change the volume.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.120]   It's got all of the capabilities you'd want.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:32.120]   And they sound superb. Oh, Siri's talking to me.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:38.120]   You can't hear him, but I can. Why settle for anything less than great sound?
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:44.120]   I mean, look, for me, I don't want a lower quality experience.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:50.120]   I want the best sound for the best price. And that's what I get with Sennheiser.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:55.120]   Right now, for the first 100 people who respond, go to Sennheiser.com/podcast.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:01.120]   When you use a promo code MACBRAKE 15% off these, the Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds,
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.120]   or any of their amazing headphones, they've got over the ear Bluetooth,
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.120]   they've got over the ear wired. Take a look at the IE300s.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   If you want a wired experience, that's the best I've ever heard.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:20.120]   Actually, if you want to go really crazy, if you've got somebody special in your life,
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.120]   you want to give them a special present, there's an even higher end.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   They are unbelievable.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.120]   Sennheiser, no sound.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:38.120]   15% off when you go to SENN, H-E-I-S-E-R, Sennheiser.com/podcast.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   You've probably heard me talk about Sennheiser before for years.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.120]   I was thrilled when they said, "Hey, we want to tell everybody about these new momentum,
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   True Wireless 2 Bluetooth earbuds."
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.120]   I'm really glad because I had not tried these yet.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.120]   I'm a big Sennheiser fan, I haven't tried these yet, and they're spectacular.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   Jason Hall did a review, hands-on tech review last year of these,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:05.120]   in which he also raved, "Don't get the earpods. Get the Sennheiser's."
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:11.120]   The Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds, you'll find them at Sennheiser.com/podcast.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.120]   Don't forget the offer codes so they know you heard it here.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120]   Mac Break.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.120]   Now back to Alex, Andy, and the crew.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:23.120]   The Tom's Guide Awards in 2021 have been released best breakthroughs,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.120]   brands, products of the year, and the Breakthrough Award went to the Apple M1 chip.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.120]   Andy, does it deserve that kind of award?
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.120]   Is it that?
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.120]   Well, it's no gybo, you know, that adorable little robot that was the product of the year
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.120]   of Time Magazine 2017?
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.120]   Yes, but we all cared about it.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.120]   Do you know we loved it.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.120]   No, I would have to -- on a lot of different metrics, yes, absolutely.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   Because it's rare when you see the development -- when you see a new component,
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:02.120]   totally reinvent and cause you to reimagine what an entire company's
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   hardware output is going to be like.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.120]   And they did that -- if they just simply created a chip that was going to be a competitor
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.120]   to an Intel or an AMD, if they said, "Let's take a look at these architectures,
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   let's find a way that we can bake our own version of that."
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.120]   Okay, that would have solved an Apple supply problem.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.120]   What they did instead is saying we were going to put the same chip in every single one of our
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.120]   products that we've been using in our iPhones and our iPads,
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.120]   and in doing so we're going to make our iPhones and iPads even cooler without really having to do
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:38.120]   anything, and we're going to make a new generation of Macs and iPads that can do things they couldn't
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.120]   do before.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:45.120]   And like we were discussing earlier in the show, it just has re-triggered excitement in
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.120]   the future of Apple hardware, which when you talk about Apple was already excitement
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.120]   at Foo Fighters concert level.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.120]   And Renee, can the M1 chip run in the iPhone as well?
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   Could it, theoretically?
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120]   It does.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   So, that's the amazing thing about this is the M1 is really just an extended version of the A14.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   Apple for years has been making one set of silicon architecture every year, and previously
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.120]   they would have like the A10 and the A10X, the A12 and the A12X, and now instead of calling it
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:20.120]   a 14X, because they did more with it, they added Thunderbolt to it, and they added virtualization
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.120]   and they added X86 acceleration, all these things.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   They called it the M1 to make it more exciting for the Mac, but it is exactly the chip that's running
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:33.120]   on the iPhone just with the same Firestorm cores, same Ice Storm cores, same graphics cores,
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.120]   which I wish they would call Shader Storm, but I don't get to make those decisions.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.120]   And Brainstorm for the Neural Engines, the same core is just massively multi-core of them,
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.120]   and if we get the Pro-level Macs, then those will be like an M1X and have like instead of
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.120]   the iPhone 6 and this one's 8, they'll have like 12, 16 cores, like they'll just keep
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.120]   scaling.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:56.120]   And that was my initial worry about Apple silicon, because Apple's advantage over Qualcomm is
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:01.120]   it didn't have to be a merchant silicon provider who worried about profit and loss between
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.120]   each client, but also had to carry the baggage for every client, like where they use DirectX
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.120]   or OpenGL, you still have to build all that in.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.120]   It doesn't matter what Samsung's doing or LG, you got to cover everybody.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.120]   And I was worried that Apple Watch would become a client, iPhone would become a client, iPad
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.120]   would become a client, Mac, but they've figured out the scalable architecture where you have
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:25.120]   A13 cores running in the Apple Watch now, A14 cores running in the iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro,
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:31.120]   Mac, MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini, and they're going to scale up eventually to like the Pro-level
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120]   machine.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.120]   And that is, it does come with its own like restrictions and does have some tradeoffs,
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.120]   but that's a real genius move that I think is going to be very hard for non-integrated
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.120]   companies to copy anytime soon.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:48.120]   I mean, I think that's the biggest challenge is that you, to do what Apple's doing, you
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:54.120]   really need to have Xcode, you need to have all the other hardware architecture, you know,
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   that's embedded.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.120]   It would, it seems like it would be very difficult to address this, the consortium that's required
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   to just take a long time.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.120]   You know, that's the, and people are talking about it, but I think that it's more than
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.120]   just that we're going to make a chip that's just like the M1.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   I think that's the, that's the part, hard part that a lot of folks are going to have.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   Well, it's like Pixar, right?
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.120]   It's like Apple three years ago, their camera team is talking, like today their camera team
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   is talking to their Silicon team and their iOS team about features we're going to get
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.120]   in three years.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.120]   And that, that doesn't happen with like Google's Pixel team barely talks to their Android
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   team because they think it's kind of unfair, which is what I hate.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.120]   But you know, that's, that's, that's how they do it.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120]   And they don't talk to Qualcomm that often.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.120]   And that's, that's very hard to rectify it.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.120]   Or maybe they do like six months out, but it's like being Pixar compared to like being just
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.120]   a merchant and like hiring out an animation company to do your picture for you.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.120]   You're right, Andy.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:47.120]   I mean, the Google is one of the big, for a lot of rumors about the, the Pixel 6 phone,
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   that it could be the first really, really flagship phone that Google has put out in years and years
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   and years.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.120]   And one of the reasons why it's getting, it's getting a lot of talk is that this is going to be the first,
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.120]   first Google phone that has Google Silicon.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.120]   God, where do they, where do they think about getting that name from?
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:08.120]   But even there, so it is their own in-house developed CPU.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   But even there, they don't have the level of integration that, that Apple has.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.120]   They have, they, of course they, they've got the Android operating system.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   They've got all the, all the Google goodies.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.120]   They have their own development system, but they don't have that sort of like three years,
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.120]   four years, five years of integration all the way across the board.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:29.120]   What, what Renee said is absolutely true.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:35.120]   There's, they, inside Google, they have to, they have to, they have to do this little dance about,
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:42.120]   we, there's so much we could do if we were not afraid of angering Samsung, the company that
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:46.120]   manufactures and sells most Android phones.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.120]   But, but there's, so this fairness involved, but there's also self interest involved.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:54.120]   What is there, is there still, is there still on Google side, is there still any concern
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   that Samsung would release its own operating system?
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.120]   Not really, there's been a lot of detente between the two companies in recent years.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.120]   As a matter of fact, they've sort of soft announced that Samsung is going to be,
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:13.120]   after, after Google has realized that we don't, we, we don't know what to do with wearable hardware
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120]   or operating systems.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.120]   Samsung, could you please make your watches run WearOS and also improve WearOS?
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.120]   They, I think Samsung realized, realized that creating your own app store,
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.120]   creating your own app library, creating your own support system is not an easy thing to do.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.120]   They had that, they had that in their back pocket.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.120]   They had the Tizen operating system for their watches, but they, they had a, a phone
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   version of it as well.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.120]   But this was something that they wanted to have in their back pocket in case the relationship
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.120]   with Google went completely squirrely, which it never has.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:53.120]   Ming Chico is reporting that the redesigned MacBook Pro coming later this year with
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.120]   mini LED MacBook Air with new display in 2022.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.120]   Renee, how, what is the veracity of these, these claims?
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.120]   It's getting to the point where, because I want a 16 inch M1 X, whatever Apple calls it,
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   MacBook Pro so badly.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:14.120]   I feel like I'm sunsues sitting by the river, waiting for the body of that MacBook Pro to just float by.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.120]   And, and we didn't get it at WWDC, which was my, because they use it.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.120]   Wow, because the image of it.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.120]   I got, I got, I got to interrupt you applaud that that was some of the best imagery we have had on the show
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.120]   and a long, long time.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.120]   Sun says, if anyone, if anyone are discord or, or, or listeners want to animate that,
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.120]   I will, I will give you $5 in your tip jar to what's going to be a $500 from everybody else.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.120]   I'm sorry, I had a great imagery.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.120]   I just, no worries.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.120]   Yeah, we didn't get WWDC, which is when like you sometimes get all the new Pro stuff.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.120]   And now it maybe looks like we won't get it until October, where it's a traditional Mac event.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.120]   And maybe some of that is the, like you talked about last week, the trailing edge node, not the M chips,
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   but like the, the controller chips and other things that are at 90 nanometers that are slowing it down.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.120]   But I'm really waiting.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.120]   And I think Apple is, is, is going to show us something good here.
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:07.120]   Like we've got rumors of 14 inch MacBook Pro, six inch MacBook Pro with new designs, HDMI, SDX, XC cards,
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.120]   MagSafe adapters on them again and Mini LED.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.120]   I know some people see blooming, maybe Alex, who could talk a little bit about, about blooming on the Mini LED,
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.120]   but it's, it's a really good panel technology.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.120]   And I want to move to a fully HDR workflow.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.120]   Like I know you do.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.120]   So having that on my MacBook Pro would just be transformational.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:28.120]   I mean, the problem with Mini LED is that there is a little bit of blooming in it where when you have point sources
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:34.120]   over dark areas, you can see a little bit of a bloom around those point sources because of the way the lighting,
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   the way that the LED works.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   And so, so there is a little bit of that.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.120]   I mean, overall, it looks great.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.120]   So it's, it's, it's overall great.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:43.120]   It's just, it's just there.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:50.120]   There are some specific areas that, you know, when you're looking at a really high-end professional monitor that costs
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.120]   thousands of dollars, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, then it starts to, you know, that's what you're
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.120]   comparing it to at that point.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120]   Oh, and not to interrupt.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.120]   Like some people say, just use OLED, but OLED at the size of a MacBook Pro screen, it has problems with
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.120]   contiguous brightness.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.120]   So you'd see splotchiness.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.120]   So like there's, there's no perfect display size for this, perfect display technology for this stuff yet.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:11.120]   And even the current OLEDs, you worry all the time about burning.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.120]   Like, you know, on a computer screen, OLEDs is not a great, even on a TV screen, you have issues where, you know,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.120]   you watch CNBC every morning and at some point you're going to start seeing shadows of CNBC everywhere.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120]   I'll have this color shifting.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.120]   So, so that can be, you know, more challenging.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:34.120]   In our news today, I thought the funniest one we had here was, we had a thing about LIDAR.
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   LIDAR will only be coming to the, the pro iPhone models.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.120]   But the funny thing is, is that in our news, we have a tweet by Dylan.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.120]   Just Dylan.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   Dylan, like, like Dylan says that the LIDAR will only be coming to the pro, the pro iPhone models earlier this year.
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.120]   It seemed Apple wanted to release all iPhone 13 and 12 S's.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.120]   We're giving Dylan a lot of, a lot of pump here because it's Dylan.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.120]   Like it's, I was just like, it's Dylan.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.120]   I don't know whether Dylan has any idea of what, whether Apple is doing this or not.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:08.120]   But it is a fairly good track record on these.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.120]   Oh, does he Dylan?
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   Dylan is the secret.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120]   Yes, Dylan.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.120]   I looked at it.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.120]   I was like, I'm going to go home.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.120]   I'm going to go home.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.120]   So now we have Dylan.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.120]   So we have Dylan anyway.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.120]   Dylan, I think you should have a better name, like the whole name, something.
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:33.120]   Well, if, if, well, unless you've named yourself against one of the many proposed and announced Apple operating systems that was going to replace Mac OS 9 was Dylan Copeland Symphony.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.120]   That, that, that would be a very good deep cut as a, as a, as a, as a cloak and dagger room or person.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   So I will say that, you know, one of the things that, that is important to remember is that LIDAR is pretty energy intensive, you know, and computational intensive.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:55.120]   So, so putting it on the LIDAR phones could be, I know that that was one of the problems that we had and one of the reasons Google never put it on their own phone, which was kind of crazy.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.120]   You know, they Google had its own LIDAR support and then it took it away.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.120]   But it, but part of that was because it burned up the battery, you know, so.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.120]   Battery usage and CPU usage.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.120]   You know, it was like literally we turned LIDAR on on the phone and be like 20 minutes.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.120]   You know, like it was like, you know, for a little while.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:23.120]   So, and it was more, we used it more for gathering as opposed to what we're seeing now, which is the, is the, you know, is tracking.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120]   You know, have you guys played with clips at all?
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   Andy, have you, have you tried the clips effects?
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.120]   My gosh, they're so cool.
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.120]   It's fantastic.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.120]   It's unbelievable.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120]   It's amazing.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120]   Especially with the LIDAR ones, it's instant acquisition.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:39.120]   It knows the surface is so well and every time I show it to somebody, they can't believe that it's actually happening because it looks like real time.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120]   SFX being applied to a scene.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.120]   Really well stuck to.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:46.120]   Is anyone, is anyone doing a lot of stuff?
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:52.120]   I mean, I think that, or I think FX Home is doing some of the stuff that is, that, that had, you know, taking advantage of some of those tools.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.120]   But it's a, it's a pretty, it's pretty slick.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.120]   What I'm really looking forward to is, is what happens with object capture as we look into the, into the fall.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:08.120]   You know, when, when iOS 15 comes out, I think that, I think object capture is going to be a big deal.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:15.120]   I mean, we, almost all of us that use LIDAR and photogrammetry as soon as we saw LIDAR on the iPad, first, we were just, we immediately knew what was going to happen.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:28.120]   Which is that eventually you're going to mix the photogrammetry and the LIDAR together because that's what we were already doing, but it's really hard because this gets into the wonders of what Apple does is that we, you know, use these photos and then we use this app and then we spend $3,000 on this software
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:35.120]   and then we spend $700 on this software and then we put it all together and we spend a lot of time and we swear a lot at the computer and then we end up with a model.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:41.120]   And now it's just like, you have the phone, take a bunch of pictures, you know, so it's going to be a, it's going to be interesting.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:45.120]   I am surprised that not everything has LIDAR on it, but, but we'll see.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:50.120]   JetBlue is bringing the iPad Pro on board with pilots.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.120]   Now JetBlue has been doing this for a long time.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.120]   And they've had iPads I think since 2013. Is that right, Renee?
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.120]   Yeah, for quite a while.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:06.120]   Yeah, and yeah, it's the gets back into why we like privacy on the iOS.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:14.120]   When you have pilots using it as a, I've been in a helicopter with a pilot that's using the iPad for, you know, all of their planning.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:17.120]   And it's, it's, I can't imagine going back to paper.
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:25.120]   You know, like it was definitely a, you know, like it's, it's so much better than, than dealing with paper.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:36.120]   Now, Renee, the other one that I saw that was very important, I think for you, is that I know you, you, you want to have a key ring that is made by the company that I can't pronounce.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:42.120]   Oh, because you get yelled at people yell at you if you pronounce LMS wrong.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:46.120]   Yeah, exactly. So I just stay away from it. I just like, I'm just like, I'm just going to let Renee say it.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.120]   So you can now make a fake air tag.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.120]   What?
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.120]   People are so mean on the internet.
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.120]   That's fine.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.120]   People are people.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.120]   They just get to be in front of a lot more people on the internet.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.120]   And I think that otherwise they're, they're that way all the time.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.120]   The, the, but yeah, so you can make this fair.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:10.120]   Do you see yourself making, making your own key ring, Renee?
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:15.120]   So we, one of the people I work with is Thomas Frank, Thomas Frank, a YouTube fan, a fame.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.120]   And we, we talk gear a lot and we have very similar setups, both have really high end cinema cameras and microphones, all these things.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:28.120]   And he will D Y I like so many things where me and some of the other people just like, we're just going to go to the store and buy it.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:30.120]   He's like, yeah, but I can make it for almost nothing.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.120]   I'm going to take two days.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.120]   I'm just going to go buy it in a cost like a hundred bucks.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.120]   And we have these arguments.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:43.120]   And for me, it's like, if I was going to buy the MS thing, it's, I'm buying it because it's like the MS thing, or maybe like your Hong Kong and you buy the tag on one place and the label on the other is on the other store.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.120]   And you can get away with that.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   But it's just not worth the effort to be.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   It's not terrible to say.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.120]   No.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.120]   No.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.120]   Andy, have you, do you, have you played with the air tags much?
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.120]   Yeah, I have a couple and they're, they're, they're associated with my iPad.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120]   And yeah, I like them.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:06.120]   I'm, I think there are lots, there are lots liquor than, than the alternatives that I'm using.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:13.120]   I like that they, they simply work all the time instead of my title tag, which doesn't always just work.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:29.120]   So, yeah, I wish that they would open it up and make it, make it Android compatible or do other devices as well, because there's so many families that are, that have, they need to find their keys, even if like their kids borrow the car and the kids are stuck with like a cheap Android phone instead of like the fancy iPhone.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120]   That one, one or both of their parents have.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:42.120]   But, but I did, to piggyback on to what, what Renee was saying, I totally feel that it's, there's a certain, it depends on whether you, whether you're buying into your phone.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:54.120]   Whether you're buying into the craftsmanship, the thing, the, the, the, whether you're buying into the thing itself, or whether you're buying into the entire story around the thing and the history of the thing.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:50:04.120]   I've been, I've, I've, over the past like few months, I've, I've suddenly learned about not fake Rolexes, but reproduction.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.120]   Rolexes.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:21.120]   Oh my God. I kind of almost want one because it is so mind boggling. How good these, I mean, the, the, the 30, you can buy, if you go to Ali Express, you can buy a fake Rolex for like 20 bucks and it is a piece of crap.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:33.120]   And it's a good, it's good for like a movie props, as long as people aren't looking really closely at it. For, if you go into hundreds of dollars, low thousands of dollars, you will get one that side by side, you absolutely.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:46.120]   And I'm, so I'm talking about it macro expansion. You are not going to be able to tell the difference. You can pop the back off and look at the mechanism and you'd have to dig down far before you would realize you're not looking at a Rolex mechanism.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:53.120]   And it comes with a box. It comes with all the papers. It comes with a receipt saying that you spend $28,000 on this Rolex.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:51:02.120]   And at that level, I kind of admire it. It's a, it's a foot to the amount of work and industry that goes into something.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:15.120]   So long as it's being sold as what it is that no, this is not a real Rolex Daytona. This is a replica with the advantage, not just that it costs you $2,000 instead of $30,000, but you don't have to have an eight year relationship with a Rolex dealer.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:37.120]   Before he will allow you to purchase the watch that you want. But there is something about, there is something very, very charming about someone who said, well, I can't afford this Hermes, excuse me, to me, the pleasure of this Hermes key ring is not about going into an Hermes store and holding something that has a great deal of history and style and, and labor about it.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.540]   about it. My pleasure is that I got to take a look at this and figure out a way to make one
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:46.980]   myself. And no it's not a perfect representation, but it's something that I made with my own two
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:52.380]   hands inspired by something that I saw and admired. So it's really become a very very
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:52:01.420]   complicated calculus about, are you buying, are you trying to commit a crime to pull over
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:08.420]   somebody or are you buying the experience that you make for the lecture?
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:21.780]   Now also tweeted out was a email from Bill Gates. This is on April 30th, 2003. And this was out to a
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:27.500]   couple of folks and it says subject is apples, apples, jobs again, a time to have a great
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:34.340]   Windows download service. Steve Jobs ability, this is from Bill Gates, Steve Jobs ability to focus on
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:40.140]   a few things that count, get people who get user interface right and market things as revolutionary
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:47.020]   are amazing things. This time, somehow he has applied his a talents to getting a better licensing
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:52.140]   deal than anyone else has gotten from music. This is very strange to me. The music companies own
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:59.980]   operations offer a service that is truly unfriendly to the user and has been reviewed that way
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:06.220]   consistently. Somehow they decide to give Apple the ability to do something pretty good. I remember
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:11.860]   discussing e-music and us saying that the model was better than subscription because you would know
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:17.260]   what you are getting with subscription who can promise that you'll that the cool stuff you want
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:24.060]   or old stuff will be there. I am not saying this strangeness means we messed up. At least if we did
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:31.660]   so, so did real and press play and music net and basically everyone else. Now the jobs has done it,
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:37.820]   we need to move fast to get something where the UI and the rights are as good. I'm not sure whether
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:46.620]   we should we should do this one one of these JVs or not. I am not sure what the problems are. However,
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:55.260]   I think we need some plans. There was kind of like a okay, so how did Steve do this?
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:54:02.460]   Remember that there are a number of breakthroughs with the iTunes music store. Number one, that flat
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:15.340]   pricing, 99 cents, no questions, no differentiation. The portability of, they didn't remove DRM but
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:20.780]   they had portability across devices where every competing service at that point, I think he might
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:26.140]   be talking, Spill Gates might be talking for instance about Sony's own music service where
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:36.380]   terrible, it didn't barely work at all. It watched your transactions of where you install these
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:41.740]   files like a hawk to make with the suspicion that you're trying to rip them off at every single turn.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:49.100]   So it was very very weird that Apple was able to get all of these deals out of these distributors
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:55.020]   that these distributors were not offering customers on their own. And so yeah, if I were Bill Gates
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:05.100]   in 2003, again Bill Gates in 2003, I would be using like the, oh my god, our parents are speaking
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:12.300]   to us plainly, calmly and evenly. This means they have never been more angry with us than they are
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:17.260]   right now. And some of us are definitely going to have our lives change in a material way.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.500]   Yeah, I, Renee, what was your thought?
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:26.620]   I love that Twitter account. It keeps tweeting out some of the best letters from like Phil
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:29.900]   Schiller and Bill Gates and everybody. And it's a must fall. If you're not following it already,
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:36.780]   it'll give you hours of old executive entertainment for you to look at. But I like the psychology
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:41.180]   of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs so much, perhaps never more than when they were both on the same stage
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:46.300]   with Walt Mossberg and Cara Swisher that one time. And you can see the admiration, but also the
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:51.980]   animosity. And like Steve, not really caring and Bill caring really desperately at the same time.
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:56.620]   And the whole thing, and I imagine that this through the lens of that, where Bill can't believe
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:01.740]   in his mind the crap that Steve pulls off just on the daily and gets away with all of this.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:06.620]   It reminds me of that Seinfeld episode where I think it was Newman looks at, or no Elaine looks
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:09.580]   at Jerry and she goes, "One day, all of this is going to come back to you. Everything that you've
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.260]   done, you're going to pay for every bit of it." And Jerry says, "No, I'll be just fine." And that's
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:17.900]   what I think like Bill's mind must be when he's like, "You got this deal as well and he's got the
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:22.220]   internet thing." And so for me, I read it that way. It's luxurious.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:27.020]   There was a lot of that both ways too. Remember the famous exchange that they had when
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:34.140]   when Microsoft introduced Windows and Steve sent this letter or email saying, "You ripped off
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:37.900]   of your... This is just a rip off of Microsoft. Excuse me. This is a rip off of the Mac and blah,
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:43.820]   blah, blah, blah." And Bill Gates simply replied that as far as I'm concerned, as far as I can
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:51.180]   say, you broke into Xerox and stole everything. What you're angry about is that we stole the TV,
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:58.380]   we stole the TV set before you got it or something like that. It's like there's... These are definitely
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:03.900]   two people that would wind up in the same retirement home and be the cause of...
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.020]   Japping each other with canes.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:11.260]   I think one of the things I think that I think Steve Jobs was known for was...
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:19.500]   I guess a nice way to say the gaslighting. But one of the things that he was really good at in
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:24.860]   meetings that I think we've read or heard over and over again is he would open the meeting
[01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:34.140]   with blunt force. You guys stink at this. You were really bad at this. And the problem was,
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:39.260]   is that if you said that and you didn't have anything to back it up, it's problematic. But if
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:44.940]   you say it and then you hit them right where they know it hurts, like right where whatever it was,
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:49.740]   that you weren't doing very well, he would just tell you what that was. And he'd outline it
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:57.100]   oftentimes clearer than you... He'd outline it clearer than you even saw it. But once you saw it,
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:03.260]   you couldn't unsee it. And so he would just give you this... I mean, you couldn't open the meeting
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:09.100]   with a swift uppercut and then give you a left hook and then start talking about...
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:12.620]   Let me show you how to fix that. You got blood all over your face right now. Let me show you how
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:17.420]   to clean that up. And I think that he was really good at that. And also, we have to remember
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:25.580]   around 2004, there was ads that said "Rip Mix Burn." And that's the... Apple was already like,
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:31.900]   if you don't go down this path, it's not going to keep going. This isn't the direction that you're
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:37.260]   going isn't working. And it had, I think, that part of the argument at the time was you're going
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:41.500]   to eventually have to find a way that it's actually easier for people to buy it legally than it is to
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:47.340]   steal it. And if you make it easier, they'll stop stealing it or not steal it as much.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:56.140]   Or you can say, Andy? No, no, I was just agreeing with you. But yeah, there's so many great stories
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:59:04.780]   about that. Also, I think that he had a sense of when he needed the stick and when he needed to
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:10.540]   seize the room and when it was okay, everyone in the room know that he had to hold the cards.
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:16.540]   I was trying to remember the... Since we're talking about the iTunes store,
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:20.860]   when Apple realized that we're going to have to go into digital music,
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:27.580]   they wound up buying an app called Soundjam and making that into iTunes. But there was another
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:33.900]   Mac music app that did the Ripping, did the music library stuff that I think that Apple was courting
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:40.380]   first. Excuse me? With one by Panic, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think that would
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:45.820]   make sense. Because I think the creator made this long, long blog post with the meetings with Steve
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:49.180]   in which he was very, very nice. And he was saying, "Well, here's what's going to happen.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:55.580]   And here's why it is in your best interest to join Apple, to sell your product to us and become
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:01.500]   the product manager for this inside of Apple. And without... He wasn't stroking a white cat.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:06.380]   He wasn't like, "This is why you screwed this up and you can't do this. Only Apple can do that."
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:12.700]   So there could be books and books and books written about his own technique about how to
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:16.860]   control meetings and how to handle meetings with probably more positive stories than
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:20.700]   negative stories, but enough negative stories that it would make it an entertaining reading.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:29.500]   Yeah, exactly. Fitbit has detected lasting changes after COVID-19. So what I think is
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:35.420]   interesting about this article is that whether it's the Fitbit or the watch, the Apple watch,
[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:44.380]   is how much data we're... I mean, like how much we're going to see about the whole world
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:51.100]   based on biometrics connected to us all the time. And I think it comes back to that privacy argument
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:56.300]   of there's a lot of data here that we may or may not want to. And I'm not saying that Fitbit's
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.700]   doing anything with this, but the overall idea, I mean, you could get to a point theoretically where
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:06.060]   it could tell you that you have COVID or you have the flu or you have something else
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:11.420]   without you having to call anybody or take any test or at least tell you, "Hey, you should probably
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:19.020]   go get tested for this." Are we worried about this or should we be excited about it, Renee?
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:27.100]   I'm going to be answering this with a full weight of pandemic anxiety still completely on me
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:32.860]   because the world is opening up at the same time we're seeing long COVID and we're seeing delta
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:37.580]   variants and all these things. And I've talked to a lot of doctors about this now and there is some
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:41.660]   who've gotten a lot of education on it and look at these numbers and say it's very helpful because
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:46.540]   they can't possibly have their... have people in all the time being monitored all the time.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:50.620]   And I talk to others who say, "I don't know what to do with this." Like when I'm monitoring a patient
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.980]   all the time, I have this complete study of them. I know exactly what's happening minute to minute,
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:57.740]   but when they just come in and say, "I got this reading off this device, I just don't know what to do
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:02.540]   with that." So I think we're going to end up in some middle ground where as this technology matures
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:06.700]   and becomes more and more commonplace and as Apple provides features, everybody provides more
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:10.780]   features about trends over time and more precise and do more education, I think then it'll be more
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:18.060]   valuable. I think for now it's just a way... if you're not already incredibly anxious about medicine,
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:22.540]   maybe then take a break. But if it's a tool that you can use to help increase your awareness and
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:26.540]   maybe look for problems that you wouldn't otherwise see, I think that's very, very beneficial.
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:33.500]   Andy, is this important? Not important? Scary? Yeah, it depends on how it's used, isn't it?
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:38.700]   What's great is that now so many people just happen to have in their possession and they happen to
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:43.260]   be wearing every day anyway. A device that can measure their heart rate, in some case, measure their
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:51.020]   blood oxygen saturation levels, can track their sleep, can track their movement, all the sort of
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:58.300]   stuff. So that once you start to... once a patient comes in presenting with a problem, you have
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:04.060]   extra data that if it can't be analyzed then and there to point to a result, at least it's another
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:09.180]   it's another set of data that could be used to try to analyze and understand this in the future.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.540]   This is what this COVID study was all about. They were able to find a correlation between
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:16.380]   here's what people's resting heart rates are doing as they make their way through this disease.
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:21.980]   There would certainly be no justification for sending someone home with an okay, here's a heart rate
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:25.340]   monitor, you're gonna have to wear this 24 hours a day, you have to recharge it every night and
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:30.140]   you're also going to have to link this up to... here's a telephone, here's a telephone coupler
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:34.700]   handset, you have to put the handset inside this thing, dial this number and it will exchange data
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:39.020]   up and down to let us know what's going on. So that in itself is really, really good. The people
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:43.980]   will be able to go through the fitness app and simply touch a button that say okay, well,
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:49.660]   when they're at the doctor's appointment, they're to participate in the study, there's just
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:55.100]   simply QR code that they scan with their fitness app that says okay, this study has been approved
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:04:00.860]   to receive the following information on a daily basis to track my health but also to figure out
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:08.140]   some more stuff about what this disease is all about. The flip side of this is when people start
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:14.860]   to... people hope that this data can point out problems before they actually exist and this has
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:22.860]   historically been a big problem with technology and medicine where someone... if you take one of
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:27.900]   these genetic testing kits that promises to give you also medical information saying oh, by the way,
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:33.820]   this... according to this marker, it means that you are 1.8... you're almost twice as likely to get
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:39.500]   this form of cancer or have this respiratory illness as anybody else. Well, now, unfortunately,
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:42.780]   you don't know exactly how that was collected, you don't know if that's totally valid.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:48.940]   Math is a funny thing. Twice as likely it means that you went from 0.1% to 0.2%.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:53.020]   There are certain magnitudes of scale are important.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:57.100]   It puts doctors in a very, very bad position because
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:04.700]   doctors do not want to put people through tests that are unnecessary for any number of reasons.
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:09.740]   However, if someone comes in with a headache and it's very, very clear that, okay, well, look,
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:15.100]   you've got a headache that you're feeling like around the entire perimeter of your head.
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:21.180]   That sounds like a stress headache. We gave you some very, very simple tests. It doesn't seem like
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:27.580]   it's anything more than that. But if you come in and say, I've been told that I'm at risk of stroke
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:32.780]   and I've been having these very, very regularly, that kind of changes what the doctor might feel
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:37.260]   as though they have to do. They might have, well, now, because if this person is actually having a
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:44.140]   stroke and might even be unrelated to the headache that they're having, I need to be able to say
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:49.340]   that I made a test for that. Now, not only are you charging them for something that they might not
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:53.980]   have needed to have, not only are you tying up a test protocol that could have been used elsewhere,
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:06:00.940]   but also you are confusing this person's chart. Everybody wants this silver bullet, but it doesn't
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:07.660]   exist. So far, the only alert that I get is that it says, I'm seated and my heart rate is very high.
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:13.100]   And every time I get that, I'm watching a stealer game. It's like, it's exactly like every game.
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:16.780]   Almost every game because stealers never win by a lot there. And even if they're winning by a lot,
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:20.060]   you're afraid that they're not loose anyway. And so, so you just gotta sit there with it.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:25.740]   The most entertaining screenshots I ever see people post on social media is when you,
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:31.420]   it's a strip of what their heart rate was. And this is one big spike. That's like, okay,
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.980]   this is when my wife told me that she's late.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:38.140]   That we might be pregnant.
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:46.780]   Now, now, Brazilian criminals have started to talk. Evidently, they've been stealing iPhones,
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:51.740]   and then they have been gaining access to bank accounts. Now, people thought that maybe they had
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:56.700]   an access to celebrate or they're doing something. Turns out they were just taking the SIM card out
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:03.820]   of the phone and putting it into another phone. How much data is, Andy, how much data is on that SIM card?
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:11.180]   Actually, a lot, your ID is on there, recent text is around there. Obviously, the identity of
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:15.660]   the phone is on there. So anything that you've, that's the problem with two-factor authentication,
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:20.380]   that it is, I think, I think a lot of us, probably, possibly myself included,
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.860]   oversold it as a panacea saying, oh, don't just trust your bank accounts or whatever to,
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:29.740]   to a password. You should also use two-factor authentication so that you also get a text on
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:34.620]   your phone so that to make sure that your, you are you, and that was before people really realized
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:40.700]   that, oh, well, you can actually clone a SIM card. You can also use social media, social engineering
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:48.300]   to convince your phone company to please, please make me a copy of, of, of JP Moneybag's cell phone
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:53.180]   so that I can, I can now get authentication to access all of its bank accounts. It's, a lot of
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:57.420]   it is just simple education. We have to talk, we have to teach people that this is where the,
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:01.260]   this is where the, the failure points of your security are and this is where, this is how you
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:07.020]   can improve them and this next, these next generations of operating systems that will rely on additional
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:12.780]   security keys for the most important stuff are going to be transformative and protecting our money.
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:16.300]   Yeah, and Renee, do you think this is just something that will slowly close up?
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:19.580]   You know, this, this, this seems to be a pretty gaping hole.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:25.180]   Well, so this is really hard stuff and it's why I really dislike hot takes on the internet so much.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:29.580]   This is basically a very clever variant of a SIM swap attack. What Andy was describing,
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:32.780]   where you go and get a SIM card, you call up the phone, come up and say, yeah, I've changed my
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:36.620]   SIM card, I need my number, put it over and then you put that in whatever phone you want and use
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:41.180]   that to get a text message to reset your password. We saw people using that to Jack YouTube accounts
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:45.340]   famously, we've seen that for a variety of things and it's because a lot of companies use
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:50.140]   text messages as a reset mechanism and sometimes even when they'll allow you to use a much stronger
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:56.620]   version, which is like an authenticator app, they'll still have a fallback for SMS messages and
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:09:01.900]   it's because there's a tension between fail safe and fail secure between people who the worst thing
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:05.740]   that can happen to them is they lose, is they lose control of their data to people where the
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:09.420]   worst thing that can happen to them is that they lose their data and it's very hard to find the
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:13.900]   happy middle ground in between. Apple can tighten this up but you'll have more people who get locked
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:18.860]   out of their accounts, like more people who have had their accounts recovered because this SMS token
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:25.820]   exists will no longer be able to use that and so it's the same thing as any security system,
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:29.740]   you have to get it to that ideal point where sure some really smart criminals will always
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:35.260]   still get in and sure some really hapless normals will still lock themselves out but you're
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:40.540]   servicing the needs of the 95% and it's, I went through this on the weekend and there's some people
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:45.580]   saying like, Apple should have a timeout, they do, in many cases it'll hit a 10 day or 14 day
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.740]   timeout before this will work and then you have people who are livid, who lock themselves out and
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:54.860]   now have to wait 14 days for their password reset and you won't make them all happy so to me as
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:10:00.780]   as long as most people aren't being exploited or being, or most people aren't having stuff stolen
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:04.940]   or getting stuff lost, we're going to have to accept some collateral on both sides which sucks
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:11.900]   but that's the reality of info, Seth. Yeah, I was a victim of this just last week where I know
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:19.740]   what my iPad Pro's password is, okay, I absolutely know what it is, however I will put some variance
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:26.940]   in there and that are very, very popular and common so I might, if I, if, so I tried to, I
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:30.700]   needed to unlock, I needed to unlock, I could face unlock when work because it was like two days or
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:36.700]   whatever and I just, I ran out of all my, I, I, I missed the first three so now it's like on,
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.860]   I'm on a five minute timeout and I'm on a 15 minute timeout, that's when I said, okay, oh well,
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:45.020]   stupid, I, maybe I should have written this down but I know what it is so I just made a list of,
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:51.100]   now it can only be one of these 12 possible variants and I already gone through four of them
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:54.700]   so I'll just like, if it takes me two days I'll go through the other six, it's going to be one of
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:59.100]   these six but unfortunately it gave me like three more guesses and then say, nope, sorry,
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.180]   I'm not going to, I'm not going to, you're going to have to reset the, reset this device completely,
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:08.220]   I'm saying really? I have had one where it says, I think it was like 64,000 days or something like
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:14.700]   that. It's like, oh no, I was prepared to wait an entire day if it got that far but it's like,
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:18.460]   no, can I rest of my life? Like this, what the fuck was it?
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:22.700]   Connect me, tie tunes and reset me, it's like, oh, it didn't say that though, it didn't say you'll never
[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:26.700]   get it. People like Andy and I have, it's like, sometimes you set up, like you get,
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:30.380]   you get like three review phones in, you set them up, you're adding too many devices,
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.700]   that's a velocity signal, we're going to put you on a timeout now for, like, what I got reviews to do.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:40.700]   Yeah, exactly. Coming up next, our picks for the week, Renee, what's your pick for the week?
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:46.620]   So, Apple today decided to surprise us with a little summer treat and that is the,
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:49.740]   I'm going to get the name right because it's different now, magsafe, power,
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:57.740]   pack, battery, magsafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 line. So, it's one magsafe battery pack.
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:02.140]   This, if you remember the old smart battery case, it's that without the case, it is just the hump,
[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:05.980]   just the hump. I looked at it when it came out, when I saw it, I was like, does it really just
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:10.700]   snap to the bag? Yep, really just snaps to the back. It attaches magnetically, it charges
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:14.700]   inductively, it's like having a little inductive charging plate but it carries its own charge.
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:20.380]   It's one size fits all, so it looks really big on the mini and really small on the maxi,
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:25.180]   but it carries the same charge for all of them. It'll charge at 15 watts, which is the maximum
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:28.860]   for Apple's magsafe technology currently because Apple still believes in sort of,
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:34.460]   Apple still using Apple's sales tools charge singularly, they don't charge parallel,
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:39.900]   but also they're very careful with battery health. And some people are getting really angry
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:43.660]   because they look at the price, they look at the capacity and this has been the case with the
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:49.180]   smart battery cases forever, but Apple really focuses on efficiency. They do a lot to manage
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:54.220]   how that power is going into the iPhone and you end up often getting way longer battery life out
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:59.980]   of them that you get over bigger units that either block radio signal, forcing the radios to power
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:06.140]   up and use more power, or that put the iPhone into plug-in mode where the networking coalescence
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.420]   goes away and it starts downloading updates and doing a lot of other things that are power
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:14.620]   intensive. So it's really good, it's really smart, it'll, it's got its own lightning plug in it so
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:19.340]   you can plug into the battery case or battery pack or you can plug into your iPhone. If you
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:24.060]   plug into the pack, it'll measure, it'll manage how fast it charges the phone versus the pack itself
[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:29.100]   in case you want to take the pack off afterwards. And it's just, it's a really nice, really elegant,
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:34.940]   typically Apple solution. You can find cheaper and bigger capacity magsafe battery packs if
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:38.940]   that's what you want. You know, some people will like those, other people like that Apple sort of does
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:45.020]   this really elegant, really refined lightsaber version, not a blaster version. And I think I'm
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:49.020]   going to get a couple of them and just keep them in my bag like, like I keep Canon batteries in my
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.340]   bag and then when I'm on a shoot or I'm out doing B-roll or, or I'm at an event, I can just throw
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:57.820]   one on, expend it, throw it back in the bag, throw another one on, charge them both overnight and
[02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:02.540]   I'll have as much, as much capacity as I need. Even if I'm using the tiny iPhone 12 mini,
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:09.260]   why not? Andy, what's your pick for the week? I have a, I put something in the show doc that I
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:15.180]   have just updated because something I ordered last week arrived just like 20 minutes ago and
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:20.220]   I'm something I'm pretty, pretty thrilled about. I'm going to set you up by saying, by mentioning
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:26.620]   one of my favorite things the entire world. This is my micro four thirds camera. My LIP is OMD
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:31.820]   EM1, which I bought like seven years ago and has been like my constant companion ever since. It is
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:37.900]   my, it is not the perfect camera for everybody, but it is the perfect camera for me and it's,
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:42.380]   whenever someone asks you, whenever you ask someone, hey, what do you think about this,
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:48.220]   this camera or this computer or this, whatever, don't believe them unless if they say, if they're
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.380]   enthusiastic about it, don't believe them until it is as beaten up as this because this thing has
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:57.500]   been carried everywhere. Every single kind of travel, it's been dropped several times, work just fine,
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:03.660]   it's weatherproof. So I've used it in the rain just fine and it is really like the most lovely,
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:12.220]   lovely thing and they updated it twice and I finally got like the newest update, which is the OMD
[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:19.500]   Mark 3 and it's been, it's the almost the exact, it's the exact same shape and size. This is why,
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:26.780]   this is why I chose the OMD EM1 over like the Sony's and the Fuji's and whatever is seven years ago
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:33.340]   because it is so, so compact and it feels so great in the hand that I can just walk around like with
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:41.580]   this big hand grip, you're, I'm removing the travel. This is an unboxing. It's the unboxing of the
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:49.580]   Wii. Exactly. And there we go. Is it true? It's 80 megapixels? This is, see, this has so much
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:55.820]   magic in it. So the star, one of the stars of the show for this camera, it was starting from the
[02:15:55.820 --> 02:16:01.180]   beginning was amazing in body image stabilization. So I've got pictures like from the first day I
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:08.220]   used it seven years ago where I'm at a museum inside with like the original lanterns from the
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:13.260]   right of Paul Revere. I'm inside this thing and I'm like, oh my god, I'm, I'm hand holding a shot
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:17.500]   at one tenth of a second and it's perfectly tack sharp. Well, this one is like another couple
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:23.580]   generations above that. So normally I've seen pictures taken with two second shutter, shutter
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:28.460]   speeds that are perfectly, perfectly sharp and usable. But they also have a couple of other modes
[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:32.380]   where if you're doing like a landscape, that's not like action, not people moving around, without a
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:38.380]   tripod, it will do, it will do image stacking and give you a 50 megapixel image, five zero. If you
[02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:45.660]   have it on a tripod, it will do 80 megapixels. And so, but there's a number of improvements are
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:50.940]   just so huge. Now, is this doing the essentially like the moving the chip, moving the sensor around
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:55.980]   a little bit like a biopixel? Right. Yeah, exactly. It moves independently of the of the lens. You
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:00.060]   don't need a special lens will work with anything. I've got, for instance, I've got my one of my
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:06.540]   dad's old camera lenses from like the 1970s. And I've got like a micro four thirds adapter on it.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:12.860]   And it will give you seven stops of stabilization even on this lens itself. But the number of things
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:16.460]   that it would take a long time for me to go through everything that's improved about this. So I'll
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:21.900]   just mention a couple of things that so this this one has two slots, two card slots, not just one,
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:27.580]   including ultra high speed does much better on 4k, excuse me, on a video than the previous one
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:33.580]   does. It does 4k also supports video out. Also, so I can use this as a webcam. It's one of the
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.820]   reasons why I wanted to show this to you this week, because hopefully next week I will have this
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:43.980]   like on a temporary mount like up here. And I can actually have like not Alex quality, not not
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:50.300]   not Alex quality, not Renee quality, but at least better and not go quality. But the fact that I can
[02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:58.140]   now charge this device, charge my batteries directly from USB, USB battery pack. The
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:02.780]   Scott now it's got a flip out return in revolving screen. So it's going to be good for vlogging.
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:08.140]   But what I like most about it is that it really is everything what I like about it is that it
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:12.220]   really is everything that I liked about the first one only like seven years better. Again,
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:17.740]   I'm sure I will not try to drop it not like I tried to drop the first version, but I am convinced
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:21.660]   that this is something that's compact that can throw inside my laptop bag, whether I think that
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:26.380]   I'm going to be interested in taking pictures or not. And if it gets a little bit of abuse, it
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:34.300]   will handle that just fine. And it's just exactly the right camera for my needs. And I can't say
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:38.540]   enough about it. This is one of the lessons about this is that it's not the perfect camera for
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:44.940]   everybody because it says micro four thirds. It has a smaller image sensor than most of the
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:50.140]   other cameras you could buy at this price. I got it was a Olympus had a huge, huge, huge sale
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:55.660]   last week and finally dropped below the price on a very, very reconditioned models at a price
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:01.260]   size. I told myself that as soon as it goes below this insane price, I can't not buy it. And so I had
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:06.380]   to go and buy it. But for this for the list price for 1600 bucks, if you're going in, you have
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:11.820]   bought lenses, you have buy anything like that, you might certainly be attempted be tempted by
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:16.780]   full frame sensors like on the like on the Sony and stuff like that. The Sony's they just don't
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:22.140]   work the same way as this one does for me. This is like a natural extension of my hand. And with
[02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:28.300]   the added features they put into this, including the increase in resolution, the increase in speed,
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:33.340]   being able to shoot, I shoot a lot of roller derby and a lot of sports now that didn't do seven
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:38.220]   years ago. And even the old one worked fine. This will work even better. It all comes down to,
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:43.900]   there is a point at which you believe the reviews, you believe the little chart that compares to
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:47.820]   different models, competing models against each other. And you believe the
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:54.300]   common wisdom that, oh, well, this has a this has a smaller image sensor than the Sony. So the
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:58.620]   Sony is going to take better pictures than that. But at some point, you have to put this thing in
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:04.300]   your hand, find the one that works best total in total as a total package for you. I would not
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:08.860]   be able to take the sort of pictures that I've been taking for the past seven years with this
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:13.500]   if I had bought a Sony and that's just simply the fact. So make sure that you buy not the right one
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:20.060]   that that's being recommended by the reviews and by all the by DX, DX mark and that sort of stuff,
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:24.620]   buy the right one for you. This is the perfect per as I'd like to say sometimes this there was
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:29.980]   an Olympus OM D EM one hole in my photography life that this spackled perfectly that every
[02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:36.780]   other camera would not have been able to fill in well at all. It's great. My pick for of the week
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:42.540]   is is actually the Oculus Quest. And the reason I'm doing it in a Mac break is because it ties with
[02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:47.020]   your iPhone really well and being able to the store on the iPhone means that you're ordering
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:52.540]   everything there. This is a huge I took a long time to buy this because I was I was pretty I was
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:58.940]   kind of prickly about Oculus in general because I felt like it kind of ruined my last pair of glasses
[02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:02.460]   you know because it just I you know because it was just one of those things that they didn't put a
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:07.260]   little roller in. But when we were going to the shore and my kids loved it and I thought oh the
[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:11.580]   cousins will enjoy it and we had some friend I had a friend that was doing some other stuff and so
[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:17.980]   anyway so I went ahead and got it and it is a transformative experience not to be tethered to a
[02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:24.140]   PC. So it you know this really freed Oculus to do a lot more interesting things. So this is not new
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:28.060]   there's nothing new about it except for the fact that without being tethered you can move around a
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:32.460]   lot more you have a lot more range. Also you're just not stuck with every time there's an update
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:37.740]   to Windows you doesn't work anymore which was kind of the standard thing with Oculus is like
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:42.380]   every time there was an update now I had to do a whole bunch of other updates and you know it
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:45.740]   was just like one of those things you know that you had to deal with and now it's much more stable.
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:51.100]   I'll probably recall still my favorite game. I have to admit I'd love to say there's other
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:56.620]   things but but the when we took it to the shore with my nieces and nephews there were we had a
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:22:01.900]   whole bunch of people in one this was last week last week yeah one of the week before and I can't
[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:09.500]   remember. But when we took it to the shore the what was interesting was is this the only time this
[02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:13.820]   wasn't being used pretty much from eight o'clock in the morning until eight or nine at night was
[02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:18.940]   when the battery was dead you know like the kids just you know used it just constantly so so
[02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:22.460]   anyway so that's that's that's my little pick for the week it's it's pretty fun you have to view
[02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:27.900]   USB-C to charge it and then comes with a little these little dudes and but it does have a little
[02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:32.620]   spacer that I did put in that doesn't push on the glasses so much so it's slightly better set up
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:39.500]   in that in that in that case anyway that's that's my pick for the week Renee is there anything coming
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:46.140]   up for you in new videos. Oh I'm doing yeah I'm just doing a ton of explainers right now I'm using
[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:50.860]   the the lull between events and you know the reopening of the world where everyone's going out not
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:56.140]   quite watching as much YouTube as they used to to do a bunch of Apple history stories you know like
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:23:01.420]   why Apple does some of the things that they do and also some explainers like I think yesterday I
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:06.620]   posted the M1X versus the M2X should I explain to you the difference between silicon generations
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:09.900]   and the amount of cores on package and I find that stuff just endlessly fascinating.
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:18.860]   Andy anything you got coming up? Yeah a couple things I'm on as usual WGBH Boston's NPR station
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:25.020]   this week I'm on Thursday at 1230 in the afternoon eastern time you can stream it live or later at
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:32.140]   WGBH news.org I'm also substituting for two members of the all about Android show here on
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:38.380]   TWIT so the fun the fun thing is is that it's going to be Florence I on regular regular host and
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:45.180]   myself we also do our own Android podcast for the relay.fm network so we're trying to figure out if
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:50.540]   we want to do like a cliffhanger at the end of this one that pays off at the next one or whether
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:55.740]   we're just going to annex the show completely it should be fun it'll be a way hey hey time I think.
[02:23:55.740 --> 02:24:01.980]   Sounds great and for office hours I mean I usually tell people a little bit about it we have where
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:07.180]   we're talking about the how to key like this is what we get into like we talk about all kinds
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:12.780]   of crazy things but next tomorrow is just how to keep Lumen key in the ATEM. It's been an hour
[02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:18.460]   talking about Lumen keys so that's coming up Darren Akata who is the used to be the president
[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:24.140]   of the American Society of Cinematographers and an incredible DP is going to be with us on
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:28.620]   Thursday and then on Friday talking about YouTube we're going to try to get I'm going to try to
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:33.020]   persuade Renee to come in and join us for this one but we'll see we'll see if we can't twist his
[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:37.020]   arm what you think you might be able to come and put you on the spot. When did you say it was?
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:45.180]   It's eight o'clock on 11 o'clock your time. No which day? Friday. Oh yeah let's let me know
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:48.380]   I'd love to do it. Okay all right we're going to try to pull you in because we're going to talk
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:55.660]   about just streaming to YouTube and YouTube I you know theories you know a lot of a lot around
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:25:00.300]   streaming but just how YouTube works so we try to pull in and Andy you're invited we love to have
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:06.460]   you. You need to come on more often in general so I do I agree with that it's the only hindrances
