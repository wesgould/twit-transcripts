[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Macintosh news, Apple news, I should say.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   You very rarely cover Macintosh news.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Joining us right now from Los Angeles, Andy Inaco, the Chicago Sun Times, that was cute.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   You quickly set back up. What were you manipulating over there?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   You're getting something ready?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   I'm taking a meeting and I had to adjust the camera so you couldn't see Mr. Spielo.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   I've said too much already.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   We just call him Stephen.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   I think that's really all he needs.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   I just realized that of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 screens, if I took to LA with me, this one might be actually useful to me during the show.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Oh good. There you go.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Thanks for being here, Andy.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Also with us, as always, Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   He's back in beautiful sunny, balmy Toronto.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   I mean, Montreal.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   They actually closed the door of the plane Leo and then they announced it was zero degrees in thunderstorming in Montreal.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   And it was too late to get off.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Well, did you have a nice visit to the city?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   It was gorgeous.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   I mean, you guys just have it rained a little bit while I was there, but I like that.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   It was beautiful weather.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Also with this Serenity Caldwell from iMore.com.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   Hello.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   Hello.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   She's got the pellet stove fired up.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Yep.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Nice and toasty.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Although it is kind of warm today, it's 69.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   So I shouldn't rely on the stove, but I love it.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   It's actually warmer there than it is here right now.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Hopefully that's shocking.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   Yeah, it's a little chilly here.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Third of November.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   We're done.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   We're done.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   Let's see.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   I guess we'll start with the...
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   I actually want to kind of do a segment on photography because I've been looking at Andy's pictures from the Boston Library and the Commons there.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   They're not iPhone pictures.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   And I'm pretty impressed by them.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   So I want to have a little conversation about the state of camera phone photography.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   And put that off because of course Apple TV has arrived.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   Many of us have them.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Can you get it in Canada or did you actually bootleg it into the country, Renee?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   No, actually I went to the Apple store as soon as I landed and they had like 300 of them lined out on the shelves.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   There's no very little network support.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   No short supply.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   Yeah, you can't get it anywhere near the content that you get in the US, but you can't get the boxes.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Yeah, in fact, I got one and played with it.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   In fact, we set it up, showed Meghan had a set here's up on iOS today if you want to watch that and I've done the kind of unboxing and a little bit of a review.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   And then Lisa said, "Well, how come we only have one?"
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Why is it not in Rose Gold?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Don't I get one in the gym?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   And I said, "Okay, okay."
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   So I ordered two more.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   So we were replacing the Apple TV basically.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   I've ordered five Leo.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   I'm giving away his Christmas presents.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   No, they're good.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   I don't know if they're $150 to $200 better than the old Apple TV.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   I was going to say, I don't know if they're, again, they're good.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   I'm not sure they're at the, "I'm going to give it to somebody who is not necessarily particularly interested in this technology because we've all had some, some not great experiences that first this first weekend."
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   So we motor through them because we have perspective and we see all the benefits that are coming future.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   I'm not sure if like my aunt who just wants Netflix would want to go through every day.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   So I figured this out.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I figured this out.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   There's this big disparity and if you're in the middle, you're screwed.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   But if you're on either end, you're fine.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   Like if you're a techie, you'll figure your way around it.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   Right.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   I put one in from my mom yesterday and all you had to, we bumped her phone and it was basically
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   done.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   She downloaded Netflix.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   We put that in once and she's super happy because she doesn't worry about any of the stuff that we were.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   Right.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000]   You're still stuck with that remote and bumping didn't work for me.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I was so disappointed.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600]   That was like going to be the coolest thing ever but bumping the phone didn't work.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Didn't work for me either.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Very sad.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   It worked after a while.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.360]   So like half an hour, we actually had to stop down the show and go and then we went to manual
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.000]   and I said, "No, I refuse to enter passwords that way."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Like an animal.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Like an animal.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.520]   I'm a man and we tried again.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.840]   How does, is there NFC in the thing?
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   How does bumping go?
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   No, you have to be close.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.240]   It's Bluetooth but it really wants to make some money.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.120]   So I held it and touched it and did everything.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.840]   How can you get closer than physical contact?
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.600]   You got to apply yourself and you got to want it.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.640]   So are you telling me that Apple intentionally installed weak white Bluetooth in there?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.440]   No, the Bluetooth is fine because it'll be closed on you.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.840]   No, I imagine it's a encryption thing.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   Oh, it's an encryption thing.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.640]   I don't know if that's official or if there's actually security reasons for it's needing
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   to be closer but I wouldn't be surprised if it was just, you know, you don't want somebody
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.080]   authenticate from two rooms away.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   That would just be weird.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.360]   So take, we took three hours to set up.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.760]   So I'm like, it'll work eventually.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.360]   I did mine manually because Vanity very quickly went DIBs automatic setup.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   Oh, all right.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   So I did the manual.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.520]   So I think what I said was I already had my Apple TV setup and I'm like, "Rene, you
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.360]   haven't set up your Apple TV yet.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.080]   You want to try doing it manually?"
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   And he said, "Sure."
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.640]   Because you have to write it up for both.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.160]   Because it cursed me for the next 45 minutes.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   It was fine.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.960]   It was a little bit consternating at first just to figure out how to do it.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.760]   But then you don't have to enter that much stuff.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   So it was pretty much fine.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.360]   But my mom's with the automatic setup took all the five minutes and we were watching
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   Supergirl.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   So it was fine.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   We couldn't get it to bump until I restarted her phone.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   And then after restarting it bumped immediately.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   That makes sense.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.760]   So yeah, just a little tip.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.600]   Bluetooth is a horrible technology.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.760]   Just need to get that in there.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   Just a little tip.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   Agreed.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.160]   If it doesn't work right away, I would say it's not horrible to do it manually, but
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.360]   you don't want to do it manually.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.560]   Because now you still have to enter your password on the phone.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   It doesn't use thumbprint.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   Would you still enter in your password on the phone?
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.560]   That makes me mad.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   Apple, you've got my password.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   You've got my fingerprint.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   Why?
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   It doesn't transit, though, Leo.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   They don't want it off device yet.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.840]   And they haven't got a good way of securing it between like against a man in the middle
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.000]   attack or someone with a radio.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.560]   I mean, they want to make sure the security stuff is against a well-funded bad actor.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.680]   And until they can think of a really good way of doing that, they would rather you put
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.760]   in a password and be a little bit of convenience than there be a front-page story.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.520]   Like someone managed to figure out how to use a radio transmitter to suck in everyone's
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   passwords.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   Well, air is on the side of security.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   And I understand that.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.960]   But it does mean you enter your password an awful lot.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.440]   I actually made my iTunes password easy because I've been entering.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   You enter that a lot.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.240]   Well, also, I think one of the reasons why people weren't just complaining, but they were
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.480]   being colorfully complaining on Twitter about the password setup is that the touch
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.920]   interface for selecting characters, it works great after you've used it for about 20 or
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   30 minutes.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   You do have to get used to it.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.880]   But if the very first time you're using this is trying to roll through this thing to type
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   this password, you're really going to be upset.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   It's a little touchy.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.600]   I actually turned Megan's remote down to the least sensitive or the slowest.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.640]   I can't remember what they call it sensitive to your slowest because it is a little easy
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.600]   to accidentally go, whoa, whoa, slow down.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   I already figured out a bunch of great tips from the time I had to do it.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.720]   So I was really happy.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   So what is the setup?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   The initial setup is to sign into your iTunes or iCloud account.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   Can you do both?
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   Can you do two accounts?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   Yes.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   You can do multiple accounts.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   Okay.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.800]   Yeah, but only one game center account, which is lame.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.400]   Do you have more than one game center account?
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.520]   Well, no, but if you're playing games with other members of your family or if you're
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:20.600]   playing multiplayer games, it's nice to be able to switch off and log achievements.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.560]   In this way, you have to log completely out of your game center account and log into somebody
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.840]   else's and you can't have any accounts running concurrently, which is kind of a bummer.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   It bumped two accounts really well.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.920]   So again, it took my mom's phone bumped into the machine and she has a separate iCloud
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.600]   and a separate iTunes account because her iTunes account predates iCloud.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.920]   You do the double bump.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   It will not.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   It just bumped once and then it said, "Please enter your iCloud account."
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   So she put her iCloud account there.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   She said, "Please enter your iTunes account."
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   She put her in your iTunes account.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.240]   And by the way, you do that on the phone or the iPad, which makes it much easier than
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   doing it with the phone.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   See, that's the part.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.200]   See, I understand why they're not transiting thumbprints, but I don't understand why they
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.080]   couldn't have figured out a way because they've been using this thing for a while.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.240]   They know how tedious it is to put in passcodes.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.360]   Let us put any, don't even update the remote app.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.960]   That's a whole separate issue, but just allow the passwords to pop up on the iPhone because
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.600]   you're doing that for a setup anyway.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.800]   Then let me just enter all of my pass.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.760]   Or they could have done something similar to what you do when you pair a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   If you don't want to authenticate from a room away, you simply say, "Okay, I've just
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.200]   given, I've just put this passcode on your phone, typing that passcode on your phone
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.080]   and the phone will say he's legit given the credentials."
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.640]   Well, it's like two-factor authentication.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.440]   And some third-party apps are doing something similar to that.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.200]   When you set up Hulu, for example, it punts you to the web and it asks you to enter in
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   a 500-year-old.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   I wish Apple would enforce that with everybody.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.960]   That's pretty much every streaming service now.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   Except Netflix.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   Except Netflix.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.080]   You still have to buy hand and enter your Netflix password like an animal.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.240]   I really thought Apple would enforce that.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.160]   In fact, I was about to praise Apple because I set up HBO Go.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.680]   All I did was go to the website and enter the code and it worked.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.480]   I didn't have to do anything on the TV.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.640]   I set up Showtime and it automatically did that.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.200]   I went to Netflix because I was real close to saying, "Apple, thank you for enforcing
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.720]   this rule because that's how it should be."
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.520]   Netflix I guess just doesn't know how to do it.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.880]   It's a strong suggestion but not an enforcement.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.120]   The other thing that's weird is to open it up and it's sparse.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.280]   You're used to it with the old Apple TV.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.960]   All these icons for miles, there's nothing in there.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.520]   You first set it up, you've got the app store.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   It's kind of nice to see that.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.120]   You've got music.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.240]   You have iTunes TV and movies.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.920]   You have settings.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.120]   There's no apps installed, not even Netflix.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   Photos, right.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   Photos.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   Beautiful new things.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   I mean, that's the same.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.160]   If you think about it, if there were apps installed, especially if there was Netflix or
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.000]   Hulu installed off the bat, a lot of users would never have the reasoning to or the need
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.760]   to go to the app store off the bat.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.920]   They would be content with Netflix by forcing them to basically have to download them just
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.760]   like you would with an iPhone.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.880]   Now they actually have the reasoning or the requirement to go to the app store and then
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.840]   they can explore and be like, "Oh, I can get Grossi wrote on this.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   This is cool.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.960]   Oh, I already own some Apple TV apps because I have them on my iPhone."
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.920]   I played so many Apple TV games.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.520]   There is no podcast Apple.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.000]   There's a rumor there will be a podcast app.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.720]   Somebody saw a screenshot, I guess.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   The best way to describe the app was...
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.640]   The best way to describe the Apple TV is that it was way too long in coming, but the
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.440]   version we're getting is racing out the door.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.280]   Yeah, I had to...
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.280]   They didn't have enough time for Bluetooth keyboard support.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.240]   They didn't have enough time for...
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.080]   It was the selection of apps.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.640]   I've only got to play with it for three days before they had a leave for here.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.560]   But I'm like, "Wow, I guess I'm so dumb.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.760]   I can't figure out how to get into the app store because every time I click on this icon,
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.200]   I see this place that only has three apps in each category."
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   It's like...
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.720]   I'm not even trying to be sarcastic here.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.520]   It really is like the Microsoft App Store that if you're going to look for modern apps
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.760]   that take advantage of Windows 10 and Windows 8, it's okay.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.040]   Let's see how many different word processors there are for.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.960]   Okay, there are two editors and they're both marked down.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.280]   That's disappointing.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.760]   And so how about I do a search for photos?
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   Not really.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760]   Okay, search for podcasts?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   No, really answers.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.040]   And you're like, "Okay, it's day one.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.520]   We'll keep the faith, brother.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   It'll...
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   Two Twitter apps though.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   Two Twitter apps.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   Three.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   Three Twitter apps.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   Yeah, all approved for launch day.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   You did a nice...
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   You're looking for reproducing.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   You did a nice little video at iMore of all of the apps available at launch.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520]   A lot of games.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   Because if you didn't know their names...
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   You couldn't even find them.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   You have to search them based on name and stuff.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.400]   The other really cool thing is I was surprised that as soon as I set up, I had a copy of
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   Cannonballed for Apple TV.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Because you don't install it on iOS.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.800]   Well, because yeah, exactly.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.880]   This whole thing where every game that I ever bought and played for about six weeks and
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.200]   then stopped playing is going to start to like zombie like come back from the grave.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   Like remember, I'm hot ass full-free.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   I mixed feelings about that because it's...
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   You loved me 2009.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.240]   It's a universal purchase.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   It's not a universal app.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.560]   It's a completely separate binary, but developers can choose to group them in a way that if
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.320]   you have the iOS app, you get the Apple TV app for free.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.880]   And that's great for us, but I want a lot of really good games.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.560]   Like I want Adam Atomic to make another $10 for Cannonball.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   Right.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.920]   Because you put in like a bunch of new awesome characters and things.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.240]   And I want to give them some new money.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.800]   But then people now when they don't see that purchased app, they just think the app doesn't
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   exist.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   So like they didn't know that.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.040]   It's a little confusing, isn't it?
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.200]   You'd probably prefer people see it then not know.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.640]   You did the only way to do this, which is to enter a single letter.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.040]   Because when you enter a letter, it shows you all the things with that letter.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.240]   And you literally went through the alphabet.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.120]   To Andy's point, there were not enough apps yet for them to populate categories or top
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.120]   ten list when they launched.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.000]   There was like some categories with one app.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.320]   So they just chose to hide them.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.600]   How many were there total on launch?
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   Under a thousand.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   There's over a thousand now.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   It's growing fast.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.240]   Well, to wit, there are three to it apps now.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.200]   And none of them official, but all of them great.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.720]   One free, two ninety nine cents.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.760]   And highly recommend you buy all three or download the free one.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   Then you buy the other two.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.880]   The two that you pay for use the API.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.640]   And then Craig Mulaney who wrote our iOS and Roku app did the third and he's giving
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.520]   that one away for free, which is nice.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   See, not a lot of O's.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:48.480]   But the P's, there's tons of P's, including Vynoc spiel zylata, which seems like a W,
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   but okay.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.040]   And Plex is in there.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.560]   And Plex is in there.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   People are very excited.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   Yesterday.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   Yeah, that's a Plex.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.880]   It's a force multiplier for any streaming box that you have.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.280]   Because if that's why the third or fourth or fifth thing I look for was Plex, because
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.960]   if you have the Plex app on that now all of my photos on my network, all of my music
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.320]   on my network, all of my saved videos on my network are going to be available through
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   this thing.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.600]   And that in itself will be responsible for at least $23 worth of the usefulness of the
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   price of this thing.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640]   Hey, Apple, I bet that it's sweet.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   We're making fun, but this is the first weekend and it's a really new device that developers
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.200]   are going to have to learn how to support.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.880]   I bet that Apple's crunch, excuse me, I would assume that Apple's crunch is to make sure
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.160]   that by the time people are opening these boxes on Christmas Day or whatever holiday
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.520]   in December, they choose to celebrate that there is a really rich and robust app library
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.760]   waiting for people when they do the setup.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   It's pretty good now.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   There's certainly plenty.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.960]   And you know, you could play the big hits across Eros.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.720]   But all of the networks you want, except of course Amazon streaming is not there and Google
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   isn't there.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.800]   Google Play isn't there.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   Those are the two.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   Apple will accept them though.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   I mean, if they want to make their app on there.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   Absolutely.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   As Apple said that, yep.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   I think they said that too.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Was it Buzzfeed run?
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Good.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   I believe so.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.680]   I mean, making by the way, Amazon looks stupid for saying, oh, we don't carry the Apple TV
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.840]   because they don't have our app on it.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   Yep.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.920]   The only problem there is that Amazon wants to.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   You have their store and they unfortunately, if they have their store due to Apple's current
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.560]   rules, it means that Apple gets 30% cut of anything they sell on that store and Amazon
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.680]   does not like that for obvious Amazon gets around that though.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.200]   On other platforms on the Xbox one, they just have an app that doesn't you can't buy stuff.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   It's a player.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   It's just a player.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   And I think Amazon should do that.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.960]   And then you have to go the web buy it.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.000]   It's annoying, but there it is.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.400]   Well, you also, you also can't buy music.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.040]   I don't think you can buy music with the Amazon music player app for Roku.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.640]   I'll double check that.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.560]   But I think there's absolutely no downside for them to at least have a player app and
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.700]   given that Google and Amazon, their whole upsell, their whole point of why you should
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.280]   buy from them instead of Apple is that you don't have to play this on something with
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.520]   an Apple logo on it.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.920]   I've never bought movies on iTunes because for me, that's just a very, very bad deal.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.840]   Well, I've only played on the Apple TV or an Apple device.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   So exactly.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.560]   Sure, I'm sure we'll see a player app from these people coming soon.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.040]   Remember that there was a YouTube app at launch.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   The YouTube app is better than the Roku app for a bunch of new YouTube app.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.040]   Yeah, very happy.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.920]   If all it did was give me the option of saying do not auto play the next video.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.320]   That's the one thing I hate about the Roku.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   It really is.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.800]   So I'm watching like a 23 minute show on like the Ben Heck channel or Tessa.com.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.040]   I'm in TV watching mode and put the remote on the counter and now it's counting down
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.840]   because it's going to choose another video for me.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.400]   I have to like put down my drink, leave for the table, grab that remote because I just
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.920]   don't want it to auto play something.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.880]   I didn't choose it to do.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.000]   Not that it hurts me, but it's like you should let me not do that if you don't want
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   me to do that.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.160]   I do have to say YouTube videos look spectacular on the Apple TV.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.280]   The biggest problem for Amazon with the with not putting the prime up there is they finally
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.760]   because they had really good PR.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.160]   We're talking about the vertical lock in of Apple and you have to use Apple devices and
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.960]   very few people pay attention to horizontal lock in and it's just as powerful and they've
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.400]   now shown people what horizontal lock in is it's like we're not going to let you play
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.960]   our videos on anyone who's platform we don't like.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.160]   And because it is a lock in like I can't just take an Amazon video and put it on iTunes
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.480]   or put it on ultraviolet or put it on Google Play.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.920]   I bought it, but I have no ability to transport it.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.000]   I'm at I'm at their mercy as much as I am apples.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.320]   And this is the first time we've really seen how the politics or the power games of that
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   negotiations.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   Well, to be fair.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.520]   To be fair, Renee Apple doesn't let any of its stuff played on the other.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   No, absolutely.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.520]   But they know that Amazon Amazon we had like much better feelings about it because like
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.560]   Andy said, I bought a ton of stuff in Amazon because I figured I could play anywhere.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.720]   And this is the first time we've seen that one maybe not.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.440]   Well, well, we don't we don't know for sure that Amazon is not going to let a player
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.000]   app not going to be actually developing a player app for for that.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.720]   And also I'm less worried about I'm less worried about Amazon deciding that a certain
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.520]   platform might not work for them.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.960]   But I don't think we have a BlackBerry version of their video player.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.360]   That's just not an idea for them.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.240]   It's untenable.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.320]   But it's a much bigger problem where I've spent $500 on movies and TV shows.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   This will never it no matter what kind of a really great phone comes out in the future,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.320]   no matter what kind of laptop I switch to in the future, it will never ever ever ever
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.280]   play on something that doesn't have an Apple logo on it.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.520]   Or excuse me, I can't run I-tunes.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.320]   So for see you more.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.120]   It depends on how but we see in like Google withholding apps from Windows phone with that
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   does to an ecosystem.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   So it's always something.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yeah, and I'm talking out of my hat too because I even rarely buy stuff on Amazon because I
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.640]   feel like I'd much rather buy the Blu-ray or the DVD and rip it.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.480]   So I just have an mp4 file.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.600]   So Web90 in the chatroom says YouTube doesn't look any better on the Apple TV than it does
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.040]   on any other platform.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.800]   I'm not sure that's true actually.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.680]   I thought it looked really good.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.200]   The Netflix feed is ridiculous compared to the old Apple TV.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.680]   It is so fast.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.680]   Oh yeah, so fast.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.600]   So what Apple does of course is it caches the Netflix stuff and places.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   And then you scrubbing stuff.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   The lovely Netflix was fast.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.840]   You scrubbed with the trackpad and then you can say skip ahead a minute skip ahead
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.600]   to miss last night.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.640]   We were watching we decided to watch Dark Knight and I decided you know what for the
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.000]   first time in a long time I'm buying it on iTunes so we can play it on the Apple TV
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.280]   and I use the Siri.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   What did he say?
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.240]   It was awesome.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   It really works.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   I use it.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   It's such an Apple feature.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.160]   Well, Lisa gets up right to do something in the kitchen and I pause it but I don't
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   pause it in time.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160]   So no problem.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.680]   I just wait till she gets back and I skip back 30 seconds.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.520]   It's amazing.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.320]   Love that stuff.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.480]   That to me is the compelling reason to upgrade if you have an old Apple TV is the Siri search
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.840]   the cross platform search and the Siri commands.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   Games.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.080]   I don't think that's a big deal but maybe for some it is.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.960]   I didn't find the steel case.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.360]   By the way that you recommend the steel series that you recommended Renee and it does work.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   The play crossroads.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   The Nipus is very nice.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.240]   I mean I think overall when it comes to Apple TV in games it's not necessarily the people
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.260]   are going to go out of their way to buy an Apple TV just for games the way they might
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:32.360]   for an Xbox or a PlayStation or a Nintendo console but it's a nice additional perk where
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.520]   it's like oh I can download all of the apps that I like to play on iOS here and some new
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.520]   ones too.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520]   And you know what?
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.080]   I love Alta's adventure on my iPhone.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.520]   I played it a ton and I still play it sometimes.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.920]   On the Apple TV it's so much better.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   Is it?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.120]   It's just a part because the you know on a larger screen certain things just make more
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.280]   sense especially I've been playing a bunch of jumping games on the Apple TV in terms of
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   platformers and 2D side-scrollers and just I have so much more fun playing them with
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.960]   a traditional console like some paths and then I would on my iPhone.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.400]   You're going to want to consider the controls on the game before you know whether it'll
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   be good Apple TV.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   Yes.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.240]   You don't want a game that uses mousing or touching of items because mousing is not
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.440]   an easy thing to do.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.000]   No and in fact it's prohibited more or less.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.080]   Well you can move a pointer around and click.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.520]   Well you can but Apple is strongly discouraging Apple TV developers to do that.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   Yeah exactly.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   It's not a great experience.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   But size for us.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   You know jumpers.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Space age does a best job of it.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.920]   Natural you know.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   Which one does.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   Space age.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   Space age.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   Okay.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.160]   We played a game on iOS today.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.120]   It was Megan's pick.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.320]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   Minion or something.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.440]   And it was it required because it would be a perfect interface for the iPad and because
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.000]   you touch something to move over there and stuff and the worst possible interface on
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   an Apple TV.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.480]   So consider that when you look at a game a game like Crossy Road pretty easy because
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.680]   you're just moving up down left right.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.640]   Crossy Road multiplayer is delightful.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.960]   I can't wait to try that.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.360]   Oh my god it's so I was doing it with my boyfriend last night and what's even better is when
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.840]   you realize that even if you're playing in single player if you have both a controller
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.800]   and a remote hooked up you can actually control the same character at once.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.840]   So it's really delightful to set your cooperative crossy.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.840]   Cooperative slash.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   Slash being mean to your partner non-cooperative.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.960]   Slash intentionally throwing them into traffic because it's really hilarious.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.960]   So just just to kind of summarize what's there and what's not there.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.760]   No Bluetooth keyboard support yet.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.640]   No there does not work with the current Apple remote app on iOS but presumably both of those
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   will be solved.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.840]   It's interesting because the keyboard usage is apparently like low single digits and almost
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.040]   all of those were developers so it was not a high priority and I don't know how that
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.120]   argument is going to work itself out and the remote thing like when you start considering
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.800]   what the new remote does it has much better detection than the old remote app and it's
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.080]   got Siri and do you want if you don't have the Siri remote you want the iPhone to transit
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.920]   Siri for you and how do they.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.720]   So I think again that's the result of it just not not having enough time to do it but
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.400]   it'd be really interesting to see how they solve that problem.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.000]   Siri is not the Siri, not the same Siri it's her cousin.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.760]   She does different things.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.560]   She doesn't do all the things Siri does on iOS.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:40.960]   You can't get a Google Play store or Amazon Prime or Amazon streaming or Amazon at all
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.120]   but you can airplay both of those right?
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.880]   Yes you can from your other devices.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   So there's a workaround.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   How does that look?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Oh it's really.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   Pretty well actually.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.560]   I mean I used to airplay on the third generation and the fourth generation's airplay is even
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   better.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   So it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's great for the apps to support it for the apps that don't like some of the Canadian
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.840]   network apps then you have to use mirroring and it's not great.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.600]   As long as they support it I play media it's fantastic.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.720]   Airplay media is lighting fast.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.320]   I didn't want to say something about Siri but I was kind of disappointed that it doesn't
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:19.680]   speak back to you because as I was packing I was as much complaining as I did on Twitter
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.800]   when I was setting it up early in the weekend.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:29.040]   By Sunday night I was in my bedroom folding clothes and just grab the remote and said
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.840]   "I won't do it."
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.680]   It doesn't use a trigger word so I don't have to be worried about that.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.080]   But what's the weather in LA this week?
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.600]   Then I dropped the remote on the bed and kept going back to folding clothes because I was
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.240]   expecting it to work like Alexa does.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.360]   Where you just keep on going it'll tell you what you need.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.960]   I said "Oh that's right now I have to face the screen and put it for the answer."
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.800]   So she doesn't talk.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.280]   She doesn't listen unless you press the button and you must hold it.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   You can't just tap it.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   You have to press it, hold it and then let go when you're done talking.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840]   All of that makes sense.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.080]   It makes sense in a noisy TV context it's exactly what you want.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.400]   Also Apple's the last company that would want to ship something with a hot mic on it until
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.160]   they feel as though they can make a case.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.040]   You mean like the iPhone 6 Plus?
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   6S?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   That one?
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.040]   It's a nice theory.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   That's got a hot mic on it.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.040]   I hate to tell you.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.800]   Well it's not the way that people would expect it to be.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   A ideological disposition.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.920]   She eschews the original hot mic.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   Yes exactly.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.880]   It's something that you personally have opted into choosing your device to be turned on.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.440]   In a TV context it could be a number of different people and if there are multiple different
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.600]   people in the room not all of them have given personal consent.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   Right.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   Well it's worse than that.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   It's worse than the other people.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   It's worse than the other people.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   It's worse than the other people.

[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   It's worse than the other people.

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   It's worse than the other people.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   If you keep watching this video, they go really close to the Empire State Building.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   It's got its--
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   This is something we're going to be pointing to two years from now.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   When the FAA finally has grown regulations, and just enjoy these, this footage, because
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   it's the last time that people are going to be allowed to simply spend $2,000 for something
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   from Amazon and shoot video like this.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   This is what it's like to be super girl when she's not in a hurry.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   Yeah, leisurely super girl.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   Most of the things we're going to get.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   Or maybe senile super girl.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   What else?
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   Come on, tell us more.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   We want more secrets.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   More secrets, more secrets.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   Well, you mentioned the double tap the home button or the menu button to get into the screen saver,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   which I think is really cool.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   What else?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   We are sure that 4K is not happening, right?
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   4K is not happening.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   There's no way.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   To my knowledge, you currently don't have the hardware potential in there to support 4K
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   and also support all of the awesome stuff that the Apple TV already has going for it.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   It might be a little jerky, and you know Apple.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   They don't want to ship anything that doesn't look perfect.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   In terms of cool, cool things to know about, there is home sharing.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   A lot of people were asking about whether home sharing was disappearing with the new fourth
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   generation Apple TV.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   It's still there, so no panicking.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   You can still end.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   In fact, that's the way that you can get podcasts.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   If you sync your podcast library on your computer, you can play podcasts on the Apple TV that
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   way.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   What happens if you double tap the Siri button?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   If you double tap the Siri button, as far as I know nothing happens, because it has
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   to be held down.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   However, there are some cool, there are some cool button tricks.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   Stop touching me.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   Yeah, let's just say anything.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   Yeah, you want to get an intelligent assistant that talks back to you download carrot weather
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   and jab the ocular sensor a few times.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   See how she likes that.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   The coolest tricks I've actually found, honestly, are the keyboard tricks, which involves using
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   various buttons of the remote to access keyboards faster.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   When you're in the keyboard screen, for instance, you can press the play pause button to quickly
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   shift between uppercase and lowercase, rather than having to scroll down to the uppercase
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   and scroll back up, then scroll down, then scroll back up.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   You can also click and hold on a letter to pull up its uppercase or lowercase version,
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   as well as any accented characters.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   So if for any reason you're looking for, you know, Amelie or something that has, you know,
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   that has any kind of accents on ease or ease or use, that's the way that you can type in
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   those characters, which is pretty neat.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   You can also, hmm?
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   No, that was a good, that's a sort of feature where you see in a lot of different apps where
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   you picture the developers of this thing getting so frustrated by something, they put something
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   in just to make their jobs as developers of this hardware easier, and then maybe not
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   knowing if that's going to pass or not for the final certification, and then everybody
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   uses it so much that, yeah, we really want to be able to type letters faster.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   We don't care if it's not obvious to the user.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   We really want this to happen.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   Oh, yeah, there are a lot of cool little tricks like that.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   Actually, the touchpad, if you experiment, some apps are pretty good about hinting that
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.040]   you can do different things by tapping the sides of the touchpad as opposed to the middle
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   of the touchpad.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:36.960]   And in fact, in when you're in a video, if you tap and click the side, like the left side
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.560]   of the touchpad, it'll instantly skip back 10 seconds.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.800]   So if you tap that three times, you can skip back 30 seconds, or if you tap that twice
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.640]   on the right side, you can skip forward 20 seconds, which is pretty cool.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   I didn't know that.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   That's a good one.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   That's good.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.600]   The new scrubber where you just start swiping on the thing and it shows you with a preview
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.960]   windows, because Netflix, it used to play really fast, but if you moved even 10 seconds, it
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.840]   would swirl and swirl and swirl.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.240]   And now it just shows you a little thumbnail and you go there and it's instant.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.480]   And not obviously, but my favorite change is when you want to play a video, it no longer
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.560]   says authorizing, making sure you're not a criminal authorizing.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.240]   It just rolls quietly.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.840]   And I think that's just a way better presentation.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.200]   There's just so much that just trashing the old Apple TV, which was terrible compared
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.920]   to everything else that was out there.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.000]   That's just the big thing.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I love that.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.360]   I love how the swiping is also velocity sensitive, that if you want to go wicked fast or just
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.720]   sensitively fast, it just depends on how fast you're swiping.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.880]   And something I learned actually from you linking that help guide Andy is that I've
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   gotten in that occasionally by picking up the remote while watching something.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.040]   And then all of a sudden I'm accidentally in the swipe forward swipe backward moment.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.760]   And previous to that, I was just clicking and like praying that I could find the original
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.880]   moment turns out if you press the menu button, that will cancel out of that screen.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.360]   So if you accidentally pick up your remote and enter scrubber mode, just press menu and
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.880]   that'll go away and you'll continue watching what you watch.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.320]   I wish I complained about that.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.680]   And then later on, it's all the user guide.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.000]   It's still worth complaining about, but I wish I had read the documentation first.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Right.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Or.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And the series is so great.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.040]   Like I just said, I bet that was another one of those.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.360]   The hardware and software developers inside Apple were screwing up so many times.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.680]   They themselves wanted a way to abort that.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.600]   I can see that so clearly.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   Nope.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.800]   Like this is not okay.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.240]   I just really love how I can say go to episode season one episode two of eyes on me and it
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.320]   will show it to me.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.880]   And Apple is actually really cool about this.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.600]   So the way that it works is if you ask it to find something and it knows that you've
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.960]   bought it on iTunes, it'll show you that first because you've purchased that and it's going
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.560]   to be really high quality and everything.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   And if it doesn't and it knows your Netflix subscriber, it'll show you that first because
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.120]   you've already played for Netflix.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.360]   So even if you have it, even if it's available in iTunes, why make you pay for it?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   It's right there.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.840]   And then they'll start staging options by what it knows that you're logged into and what
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.480]   it knows you've already paid for.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.040]   And then it'll show you services if it can't find them elsewhere that yes, I know you're
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.840]   not a Netflix subscriber HBO subscriber.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.720]   But if you were, you could get that at this and it makes it both sort of empathic but
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.760]   also increases discoverability, which are both great things.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.320]   So you can use the remote as a controller for the game.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:24.200]   You can use the steel case or other Bluetooth gaming controllers that are made for iPhone
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.240]   or made for iOS as a gaming controller.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.400]   Can you use your phone or tablet as a gaming controller?
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   You can, but it requires an app for that specific game.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.720]   So for instance, you can use Crossy Road.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.480]   You can use Crossy Road, the iOS app.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   What?
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   To control Crossy Road on television.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.000]   Yeah, that's how the multiplayer works.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.400]   Do I have to Bluetooth my phone, connect my phone via Bluetooth?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.120]   Yeah, I believe it uses a Bluetooth connection.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.120]   So I pair my phone.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   So you just have to make sure that Bluetooth is on.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120]   You don't even have to pair it.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.480]   You just have to make sure that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are on.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   Nice.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   And then it'll auto find it.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   Wait.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.640]   I will say Crossy Road, there have been some people who are having initial problems with
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   that.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   For squitting Crossy Road on your Apple TV, we'll reset that process and make it work.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   Okay.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.280]   At least that's what that's what seemed to have been having.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.640]   But that's generally the process is that an iOS app to use an iOS device as a controller,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.560]   it needs a companion iOS app.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   Yes.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.200]   Until they come out with remote.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   Until.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   At one point.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.760]   Well, even then it would be hard to have one remote that's properly controlled.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.680]   You kind of like it to be a second screen.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.080]   I think it's the way to do it.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.160]   So, the Smools Sing is actually a really great example of that.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.600]   They have a karaoke app that they've had for a number of years on the iPhone.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.320]   And on the iPhone, I kind of thought it was a little gimmicky.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.560]   On the television, it makes perfect sense where you have these big, you know, you can
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.760]   turn it into a karaoke party, essentially.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   Right.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:54.480]   And you use the iOS app not only as a secondary cheat sheet, but it turns into a microphone.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.800]   So you just hold it like this while you're singing along to the karaoke on the big screen.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.680]   According to Mac rumors, I don't know if this is true.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.760]   I have a 3D TV.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.040]   There will be software that will use the Apple TV to create a 3D.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   I guess it could.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.440]   I mean, it's just a form of video.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.680]   So there may be some 3D gaming on this thing.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.120]   That would be Pangea apparently is one of the.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   Yeah, there were some.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.960]   I think on the first days, some people saw some of that in the download stuff.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.120]   And if you have the glasses and you have the TV that support it.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   I do.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   I have to try it.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.640]   I think it's a big thing in there.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.320]   If you're watching Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, that makes sure that nothing gets too
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320]   loud.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.280]   You can say don't bother.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.160]   It's the don't bother the neighbors setting because I'm like.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   Like Sonos is.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.080]   Well, movies with big dynamic range.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.720]   You can't the talking is very quiet.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.760]   And then something blows up.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.800]   And I actually I got in trouble with my when I lived in an apartment with my with my neighbors
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.320]   because I started to watch Batman Begins and I couldn't do it.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.080]   Parts watching Batman and turn it down quick.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   Oh my God.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.760]   All right.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.680]   I think we I think a good tour now.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.120]   Let me ask the really the $64,000 question or at least the $150 to $200 question.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.000]   Who should buy the Apple TV?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.960]   I would say somebody who is next year.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.480]   I think there's going to be a wider pool of people that will are going to be really
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.640]   happy with Apple TV from day one.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.720]   I think it's a narrower pool right now because of lack of apps and features that clearly
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.920]   are going to come in the near future.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.480]   But we're ready yet for ship date.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.720]   I think that if you have if you're really heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem right
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.960]   now, if you already have an iPhone, if you're having iPad, if you've already been buying
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:43.400]   games and apps and if you are not intimidated at all by setup and by things that don't work
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.960]   100% properly, that I don't mean that you have to be have the courage of a lion.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.480]   I mean, that's as long as you don't run screaming when you see an LED that's supposed to be
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.200]   blue and it's suddenly yellow and you don't know why.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.960]   I think all those people the there's still a 99 for people who absolutely don't care
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:07.000]   about advanced things other than Hulu and Netflix and HBO and the Lifetime channel.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.840]   And I sense of course.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.840]   At $99 Roku box.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   Oh, not iTunes.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.920]   No, that's the promise of very competitive space.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.400]   And I think there are a lot of people who don't care.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.480]   Maybe they would care if they had a friend who they went over to watch TV at their place
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.800]   and they saw all the things their friend was doing.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.960]   Let's say in February of next year when the apps are and the hardware is more mature.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:38.000]   But you can't just like you can't get me convinced to even look at a $35,000 car when
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.360]   a $20,000, $22,000 car has has wheels, a steering wheel and it's a place to plug my phone in.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.520]   I don't care about anything above that.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.400]   But it's good now it's going to be great later and you have to really know that you're not
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.200]   just pick up the remote, make one thing work.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.360]   Also play with the remote for at least a second.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.920]   So if you absolutely despise it, maybe you want to buy the next generation or wait for
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   third party remotes.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.800]   You know, at first it was a little touchy.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.640]   I have come to love it.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.040]   Having a trackpad and the click there is a really nice additional feature.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:20.520]   I like the trackpad but it's I don't know what Apple cut a deal with the devil in the
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.320]   mid 90s to get its life back.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.360]   And the devil said there's going to be a price and you will magically have an utter
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.040]   inability to understand how the human hand works.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.320]   Because anytime you give them a keyboard to design, a mouse to design or remote to design,
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.720]   they will go down the path of design.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.760]   We will make it look nice without realizing that, okay, so you've basically built this
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.880]   thing so that it is symmetrical on both ends.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.440]   We put all the buttons in the middle so you can't simply pick it up in the dark and instinctively
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.640]   know as you would do with a Roku remote, which end is up and what you're actually pointing
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   at.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:04.000]   They put, you do train it to, you do get used to picking it up without scrubbing backward
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and forward and there is that trick.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.160]   But it's also, there's no sense of touch about it.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.320]   It's flat, flat, black on the business side.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.760]   So again, good luck finding it when you've got the whole-
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.040]   >> I hold it upside down half the time.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.680]   >> It's like, I would mention my dream streaming box I think would be the Apple TV with the
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.400]   Roku's remote because it's got this big, you can hold on to it.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.640]   It's got big, thick, clicky buttons that you can find in the dark.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.680]   I'm hoping that there's going to be third party remotes that incorporate the touchpad.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.760]   I don't know that Apple's actually interested in letting that happen yet.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.400]   I have a couple questions and then I haven't gotten answered yet.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.600]   But this plus a new remote, for me, I would spend a hundred bucks on a new remote.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   >> You also don't.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.240]   As I learned, because I used to put the Apple TV remote, it was so easy to lose.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.560]   I'd put it in my pocket.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.240]   Well, almost watching TV.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.960]   You can't do it with this one because the trackpad is still live.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.520]   So they should have a way that trackpad should be to say, it should, maybe it's too
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   much to ask.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.480]   >> I bet someone's going to make, just like we were talking about these nice spec rubberized
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.440]   cases for phones, I bet someone's going to make a case that fits as tight as this.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:18.240]   Only it's basically, well, no, what it is, it would be longer than the remote.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.720]   So that suddenly the buttons are clustered up the top instead of in the middle.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.240]   So you actually feel them going.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.640]   And also if they had a little bit of a bump margin on the side, you could pick it up without
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.560]   touching the trackpad at all, or you have some surface in order to make that happen.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.680]   I mean, just without doing a brand new remote, for me, if you just put like a shoe around
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.480]   it, I complain about that.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.320]   >> I was a long term.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.840]   >> Put a Pokemon sticker on the back of it up the front so that by feel, you can feel,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.800]   you know, your squirtle showtattle.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.840]   Feel the puffy sticker there.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.800]   I know that suddenly I know it's right side up, I know it's pointing towards the right
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   direction.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   >> Here's a little deal.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.080]   If you have an old lightning dock, you just dock the remote right in the light.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.240]   >> That's what I've been doing, yeah.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   >> Have you?
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   >> It doesn't need charging out of the box.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.800]   >> No, I charged my dev kit for overnight when I first got it because it was being a
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.120]   little wonky, but I think that might have just been the software as much as it was the
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   remote.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.680]   I haven't needed to charge it since I got the dev kit and that was, I don't know.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.680]   >> Three months?
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   >> A month and a half, yeah, two months ago.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   >> Are you sure an indicator?
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   Is there somewhere I could maybe on the screen?
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.960]   >> I'll show you now, but I'll show you what's green.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.640]   >> Okay, and how long does it take to charge?
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.960]   >> Also, if you go into settings, look for the remote, it will actually have the battery
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.960]   status.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.320]   >> The battery level, yeah, it takes a nine hours for full charge.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.480]   >> Whoa, dude.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:50.720]   >> But again, that's one of those things where, oh, my remote is low, okay, it flashes 20%,
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.160]   I use it and then I put it on the dock at the end of the night and then I get it in the
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   morning.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.760]   >> I think a game controller that could be used as a remote as well.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.200]   >> Absolutely, yeah.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.480]   And you can set up a universal remote as your remote as well and that does everything except
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.080]   Siri and the home button.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   >> Okay.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.480]   >> I really like the Siri remote because I think they really nailed the interactivity
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.520]   on it because on an iPhone or an iPad, you're used to direct manipulation.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.160]   You see something, you touch it, you move it, an Apple is so good at one-to-one tracking
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.720]   that you forget it's glass and you think you're actually moving stuff around.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   On the Mac, it's different.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.520]   The Force Touch Trackpad does a really good job of sort of intermediating that, but it's
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.400]   still you're touching something down here and you're moving a pointer on the screen.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.720]   With the Apple TV, they have the Focus UI, which is different than a mouse pointer interface
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.040]   and still they've built it so that as you're moving slowly, you feel the icon or whatever.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.560]   It's almost tilt over and move a little bit with you and then you feel it go over the
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.360]   edge and when you go fast, you're sort of goes, almost like it's hitting little edges
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   as a go.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   And I think they made it a really good job.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.840]   I feel connected with it and I didn't think that I would initially because that's such
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.200]   a hard problem to solve, something in your hand, something you're seeing 10 feet away,
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   maybe.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.080]   And I really like the way that there are some problems with it, of course, but I really
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.600]   like the connection that it gives you.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.560]   I got to say that I was a little bit disappointed when I first saw it, because I wasn't at the
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.400]   event when I saw it on video and I thought that, geez, it's too bad that's the exact
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.600]   same basic interface visually as the old Apple TV.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.240]   Now that I'm actually using it, I really love those little touches of, as Renee says,
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   subtle bits of motion in the icon so that it's sort of reacting to your intention that
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.080]   helps your eyes guide your hands to what you actually want to do.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.400]   I hope that continues forward in that direction.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.640]   Still wish that the UI were a little less stark.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.160]   It's as I'm setting up and using it.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   Oh, good.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.360]   It's medium grade text on a light grade background.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.160]   Here we are in East Berlin in 1968.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.000]   Well, and also I don't think it's immediately obvious which icons are selected.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.640]   I know it's attractive to have the drop shadow and a kind of semi 3D look, but it's not
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   a lot of people have.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.440]   Remember that a lot of people have crappy TVs.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   Right.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.240]   I have a good TV and I still can't tell.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   You know what?
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   I would be ugly.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.560]   Put a big red ring around it, please.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   I can't.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.480]   I know it's ugly, but functionality sometimes has to take a fantasy.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.600]   I would like to see what that testing lab looked.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:14.420]   I bet they must have gotten everything from $10,000 to state-of-the-art screens to Black
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.000]   Friday, $62, and then ignored.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   There was a lot of volume.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.120]   I guarantee you, on a Yugoslavian TV, you don't know which button is highlighted.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.200]   Like it's very subtle.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.760]   Four megahertz refresh rate.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.360]   You know, one to 10 contrast ratio and it still has to work.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.680]   Andy and Akka Renee Richie, Serenity Caldwell, that was an hour on the Apple TV, but I think
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.760]   it was worth it because it is the latest product from you and shiny Leo.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.500]   So, and shiny.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.260]   It's very new and shiny because they protect every surface with a piece of plastic.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.260]   You have to unwrap everything.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.260]   Everything.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:58.260]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle G-E-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.020]   Here comes the new iPad Pro.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.740]   We'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.900]   Maybe it's time to trade in your old iPad Pro.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.900]   Actually you don't have to.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.340]   This is the beauty part about Gazelle.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.420]   When you go to Gazelle.com, you can get a quote on your existing iPad that's good for
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   30 days.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.800]   You don't have to decide to sell it for a month.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.960]   So wait till you get your iPad Pro.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.480]   Maybe you don't even know if you're going to buy it.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   Get the quote now.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.760]   It's locked in and that's the main point.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.880]   Of course, as we get closer and closer to ship date, just as time goes by, all of these
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   products lose value over time.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.240]   So get the quote now.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.400]   Lock it in for 30 days.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.160]   That's to your benefit.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.560]   And then if you decide, I don't want it, no big deal.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.280]   And if you decide, I do want to get that upgrade.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.480]   Now you press the trigger.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.820]   And while you're waiting, add your old phones, your old tablets of other manufacturers like
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.740]   Samsung and Microsoft.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.700]   Just find all those old gadgets and pile on.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   Gazelle will send you a box.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:55.160]   They ship it for free on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:01.420]   They turn it around fast and they send you a cash, a check, or a PayPal credit, or an
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.900]   Amazon gift card, they'll bump the value of that 5%.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.620]   Now you may say, well, what happens to all this great stuff that I'm selling?
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:13.820]   Well, the best of the best is in Gazelle's store, yes, Gazelle now sells as well as buy.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:18.360]   If you're looking to buy a certified pre-owned device, they have a variety of iPhones, iPads
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.180]   and Samsung Galaxy phones to choose from.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:27.540]   Each device is fully inspected back by a 30-day return policy sold without a carrier contract.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:35.060]   It's a great way to get a replacement phone or to get a phone for a kid or just, you know,
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.740]   give some money.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.860]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com to buy to sell.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.420]   You've got to go to Gazelle.

[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.780]   Trade in for cash or buy certified pre-owned at Gazelle.com.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.660]   Today, we thank them so much for their support.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.100]   Mac break weekly.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.100]   Now I'm in Hawaii.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.100]   I think this is Hawaii, right?
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.900]   Is it Hana?
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.900]   That's pretty.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.340]   I think the beginning of lost.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.340]   It's the beginning of...
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.620]   No, I think it's the beginning of Jurassic Park.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.620]   Fantasy Island.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:09.620]   They play!
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.620]   They play!
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:15.420]   This is not the one I was talking about where you're flying in a drone.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.660]   This is probably a helicopter shot, but there's drone shots where you're really right there
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.660]   in the trees.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.860]   It's pretty cool.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.660]   Thank you, John Coates, for making that possible.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:25.660]   I appreciate that.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.540]   I hope Apple doesn't get mad at you.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.500]   There's two ways it could go.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.300]   Apple could sue them or they could hire them.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.300]   There's no in between.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.340]   All right, let's move on.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:44.940]   Andy, you took some amazing pictures with your new Nexus phones, the 5X and the 6P.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:52.660]   Andy, by the way, if you're not following Andy on Flickr, Flickr.com/Andyi is a must.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:56.940]   Some great cosplay stuff, but I was looking at the squirrel and I thought when I looked
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.660]   at the squirrel, gosh, that is a beautiful photo.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.060]   Must be an iPhone 6S Plus.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.060]   No.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.420]   It was the Nexus 6P.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:13.540]   It helps that's the optimum way to take a picture of anything.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.660]   It was like late afternoon sun hitting it exactly the right way.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:23.340]   If you look at his paws, his head is in shadow of the pauser and this beautiful golden sunlight.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.860]   Yeah, but the detail and everything on the fur is really crisp.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.540]   I like the bokeh and the back.
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.820]   So the question really is at this point, you could pretty much get an email at the top
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.100]   of the line camera phone and get pretty good results.
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.940]   Is Apple still the leader?
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:47.060]   I've been thinking about this because I've been, I had a wonderful week with the 6S Plus
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.540]   at New York Comic Con and also walking around New York taking test pictures.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:57.260]   I've now had about a week trying to take great pictures with these new Nexus phones.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.940]   And I have had it hard times.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:07.180]   I don't think I can say that as actual JPEGs that the iPhone pictures are better than the
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.980]   Nexus ones or vice versa.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:14.300]   I would say though that the iPhone is still a better camera and it really comes down to
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   the CPU.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:19.340]   It is fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast because not so much.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.540]   You mean the experience is better, not necessarily the experience?
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.260]   Well, the experience is better, but also it works better.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:32.020]   The Nexus, it focuses pretty much as fast as you would want it to focus.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.420]   But with the iPhone 6, it's noticeably faster.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.820]   When you're taking shots in sequence, you're basically with an iPhone shooting a 30 frame
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:46.060]   per second movie at 8 or 12 megapixel resolution.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.140]   With these, it's slower and also it gets choked up faster.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.180]   The other thing is HDR.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:01.140]   You may as well keep HDR mode on all the time with the Apple because not only do those calculations
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.140]   and take the picture almost as fast as it can take a normal picture, but because it saves
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.140]   both the...
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.700]   It also can quickly save the original and also the HDR version side by side.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.020]   You have both copies.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.380]   With this one, it takes beautiful HDR pictures.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.060]   It's not like it...
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.940]   You wind up with a watch cursor for five minutes, but you take an HDR and sometimes you'll
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.100]   have to wait about a half of a second or three quarters of a second for it to finish writing.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:33.100]   Panoramas, they don't end as soon as you tap the stop button as they do with the iPhone.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.420]   And then thirdly, there's the range of camera software that's out there.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.540]   My bag was one of the last ones to get off the carousel yesterday, so I wound up just
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.300]   killing time with all the different...
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   Playing with all the different editing apps that I have on my iPhone.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.300]   So what does this look like as oil painting?
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.420]   What does this look like as a watercolor?
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.540]   What does it look like when they're trying to find squiggly lines to trace in there?
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.340]   There are plenty of really great editing apps for Android, but a lot of the really creative
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.500]   and fun ones are only available for iOS.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:10.060]   So I'm not saying that Android isn't inferior camera, but I'm saying that if I were...
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.460]   Let's say that I were buying a phone strictly for the purpose of being...
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:19.060]   Doing everything you could associate with photography, which once again...
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.620]   It involves so much more than simply getting the JPEG at the end.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.900]   It's the process that gets you to the JPEG.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.180]   I would still say that the iPhone is the best camera you can get.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.820]   DS, DXOMark, which really does this all synthetically.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:35.100]   They do it all with with a Q&A test.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.900]   It's not a subjective...
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.260]   I like this picture.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.540]   It's really based on some...
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.180]   A lot of tests.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180]   Science.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180]   Science.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.140]   And I don't know if they're trustworthy or not.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:55.020]   They rank the iPhone 6S fairly low down.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.380]   It's 11th in the ranking.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.260]   Xperia Z5 is number one.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.780]   But I think these differences, there are a couple of points differences, they're probably
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.220]   fairly minor.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.860]   The S6 Edge is number two, the 6P, number three.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:09.500]   The Droid Turbo II is number four.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.980]   The G4, the Note 4, the Moto X style all tied.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.380]   I'm not sure I'd give the Moto X style a very high mark.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   So I guess...
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   I'm not sure I'd give the Moto X style a very high mark.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380]   So I guess...
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.380]   The Antech published finally published their 15-page review.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.380]   Yeah, it got their gold editors' choice gold award.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.380]   Everything you've only given once before in their history.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   Wow.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.820]   It's worth reading just for them describing what Apple did to the...
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:37.220]   Not just the A9 processor, but also basically have a PCI controller that makes the SSD work
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.300]   like a Mac.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.780]   On a technical level, including the image processing, which Andy was talking about previously,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.300]   they're just starting to lap people now.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.580]   And that's what I find really, really fascinating.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.820]   And they delve a little bit into the chip gate thing, and they basically say that if you have
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.620]   the other chip, it's still the best chip in the world.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.620]   There's no...
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.620]   I have the...
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.940]   As somebody who has the other chip, I'm very happy.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940]   I have the same stuff.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.020]   Yeah, it's the best or the best disk, I guess, chip in the world.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.220]   But just what they put that thing through to test it was remarkable.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.020]   And I like that an Antech does that kind of stuff.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020]   I really do.
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.060]   So it's important to note that DxO provides a really great service.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:17.340]   They have specifically chosen not to be a subjective test suite.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.660]   We are scientists.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.180]   We will tell you here is what the instruments that we have aimed at this thing are telling
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.500]   us and giving you numbers.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.820]   They don't pretend that just because this phone has a higher number than the other,
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.500]   it's a better camera.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:34.620]   So that's why you still go to people like Renee and Serenity and me and you to at least
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.940]   collect here is what these people's...
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.540]   These individual people's priorities aren't.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.340]   Here's what they think.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:47.780]   The other thing is that I did on my photo walk on Friday, it really was one of those six
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:52.420]   phone photo walks where I had iPhones, I had Android phones, because I really wanted to
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.660]   see what it would be doing in different situations.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.900]   And I would say that when you get down to the...
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:03.460]   In terms of the final JPEG, I do think that the Nexus and the iPhones are on the same level
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:07.340]   because shot after shot after shot, we'll be taking these same things, same setup, same
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.660]   position, same time of day.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   It's not...
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:15.500]   Maybe one picture will be better than the other, but it would be based on...
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:20.100]   I wish the sky were a little bit bluer or I'm glad that the Nexus decided to make this
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.340]   image a little bit warmer.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:26.380]   Things that are kind of random to what the software thinks is the best solution for this.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.780]   And you also can't forget that I think the one of the great equalizers in iOS is the photos
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.780]   app.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:38.300]   I don't think any other app for any phone makes it so easy to simply say, "This picture is
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.820]   good, but I wish it were a little bit warmer."
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:45.580]   I wish that there was a little bit more detail in the shadows.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.420]   Lots of different apps will let you increase contrast, increase saturation, apply these
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.420]   filters to it.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.460]   I don't think that anyone does it as well as, "I want the light to be more light.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.180]   I want the color to be more color."
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.300]   And it will do all these intelligent things, just like you had handed this photo to a photo
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.380]   finisher who understands that when you say, "I wish this were brighter," what you mean
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.500]   to say is that I wish that there were still really good, deep colors and blacks.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.500]   I wish that there were some more detail in the shadows.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.660]   But I don't want you to make it so bright that suddenly this light in the background is not
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:22.700]   as this big, flashed out triangle of why I want you to have still some color in it.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.700]   So it's an equalizer.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.380]   I think at this point, though, and by the way, we still haven't seen the new Microsoft
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:34.060]   phones, the 950 and 950 XL, just the sample shots I've seen are pretty amazing.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.780]   But I think at this point, it's safe to say you don't now have to pick a phone based on
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.060]   camera.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.940]   You can pick it on other things, maybe how the camera works for you, how it feels in
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.940]   your hand.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.460]   Also, I think Andy said this previously too, but if you just want to take a photo and
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.100]   all you want to do is pull out of your pocket, take a photo quickly and put it back, it's
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.540]   different than if you want access to RAW or all sorts of other features.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.180]   So you can sort of pick the one that is best.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.860]   If you don't care about any details or you just pick a phone that lets you take great
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.780]   photos, if you have very specific needs, you can pick a phone that meets those.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.700]   Andy, how can you take a picture?
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.580]   You didn't promise it would be a good one.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.500]   That's something I didn't mention.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:13.180]   I do wish that Apple gave us some sort of a shortcut to take a dead phone and turn into
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.180]   a live camera.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:20.100]   I love how, like on the Samsung, you just double tap the home button and it will wake
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.460]   up, unlock or at least unlock into camera mode and launch into the camera.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:28.300]   I love how the Motorola phones, as you're taking out of your pocket, all you do is do
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:33.820]   this as you're putting up your face and that motion wakes it up with an odd man.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.340]   With this, it's still, I have to, it's not complicated, especially since they put the
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:42.020]   camera icon on the lock screen, but you have to get into doing this.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.460]   You can double tap the home button.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.260]   I double tap the on/off button.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.260]   Do it?
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.260]   I don't know, hang on.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:52.060]   Well, it's a little weird because the first step turns the screen on.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.060]   It's a little weird.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.220]   Quickly double tap the on/off button on the 6-bit.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.780]   A little bit of rain.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.780]   Sposed to.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.780]   Maybe the, I don't know.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.220]   The iPhone turns it on and off.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.380]   That's the iPhone 6.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.620]   I think it's a poor choice.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.060]   I think it's a poor choice.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:12.420]   You know, the note 5 double tap the home button, that's a little bit better choice.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.580]   I think it's a little weird choice to, oh, I didn't know that, double tapping the home
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.020]   button turns on Apple Wallet on the iPhone.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.900]   That's a Vio-stein.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   That's nice.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.580]   I'm sorry, do you realize, is that supposed to work?
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.500]   It's not working on the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.300]   Yeah, it's supposed to.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.100]   It's a setting that you have to turn on.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.260]   Maybe it's not turned on by this way.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.260]   It's enabled by default.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.260]   I thought it was.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.620]   On the 6S and the 6S Plus, but if you're on a previous version of iPhone, it's the same.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.060]   Sereneze is talking about the Apple Wallet and we're back on the 6P.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:44.060]   Oh, sorry.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.060]   Double tap.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.540]   I'm sorry, double tap to launch the camera.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.460]   To launch the camera, yeah.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.460]   OK, I will.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.580]   Doesn't work on mine, but I'll have to ask Jason Howell, who's our Android expert.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.580]   Chris, my 6P is--
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.460]   No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.180]   I said that that does work on the Samsung.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.340]   I thought that you said that it also works on the iPhone 6.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.780]   Suppose double tapping the on/off button on the Nexus 6P is supposed to turn on the camera.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.780]   Yes.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   I thought you were talking about the iPhone 6.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.260]   Oh, and the iPhone 6, I don't know what the hell.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.260]   We're all talking about the iPhone 6.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.740]   Now we're all confused.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.420]   You can say, yo, Siri, take a picture and it'll do it all.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.420]   For you.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.420]   It's Siri.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.420]   I would love that.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.420]   Thank you.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.420]   Now, like 200,000 readers just got pictures.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.420]   I said, yo, I said yo.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.420]   That's what we should say.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.920]   We'll say yo, Siri, from now on, and that does not--
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   Siri.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920]   A boy telephone.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   A boy Siri.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.080]   You can say yo, Siri, take a selfie and it'll turn on the camera, but not switch it around,
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.080]   which is my personal heartbreak.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.840]   Oh, gosh, it should do that.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   All right.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.860]   By the way, Apple's results came in minutes after we went home last week.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:49.380]   Nothing really surprising.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:57.080]   Maybe more surprising was Tim Cook's unwillingness to kind of say bullish things about next quarter,
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.880]   but I guess they always do that.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   It's the currency.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880]   They'll currency headwinds.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   They're hedging and there's headwinds.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   Yeah, they're hedging.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.240]   But the good news is sales were very strong in China.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:14.180]   Just as Cook said they would be, iPhone sales grew 22%, 48 million iPhones sold in
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.480]   Apple's Q4, which is the quarter just then.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   Ridiculous.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.820]   Sales declined 19.5%.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   Not surprised.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.660]   No, everybody has what they want now.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.940]   Well, I think they also changed.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.020]   Did they not change the accounting?
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.180]   So instead of doing the subscription based accounting over two years, it's three years
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.140]   now to sort of recognize the longer updates cycle.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.140]   That's interesting.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.060]   They've changed that and also there's major anticipation for the iPad Pro.
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.460]   So people who might have considered an iPad Air 2 are probably not considering one because
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   they're waiting.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:51.360]   And remember that we've all believed that the iPad Pro was a fit a company as of a year
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   ago.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.040]   So that's probably that's probably a good point.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.960]   So this is the quarter ending September 30th.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.840]   That's their fourth quarter, which means they ends their fiscal year.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:06.920]   That means the annual report is going to come out and venture beat has a little analysis
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.720]   of the annual report that I thought was interesting.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   R&B, R&B.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.360]   I wish I had R&B budget, but they don't.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   The R&D.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.940]   It's Dr. Dre in the R&B.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.260]   Maybe he is.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:23.220]   The R&D expense was $8.1 billion.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:27.420]   That's a significant $2 billion increase since last year.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.420]   Cars ain't cheap.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:29.420]   L cars ain't cheap.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:33.540]   Well, and that's good because for a long time, the Apple R&D budget was kind of below
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.980]   what would be traditional for a company of their size and wealth.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.740]   Did you see that when the stock went down, Apple bought, I forget, it was like $14 billion
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.740]   for the move.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.300]   That's what you do.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.300]   Prop it up.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.700]   Get a deal on your own stock.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.980]   They do have over $200 billion in cash.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:55.020]   They now have 110 full-time and 110,000.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:59.000]   I wish they had 110 in full-time employees, but no.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Really, really stressed and overworked weapons.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   Worked and awfully hard.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.720]   And three of those are Phil Schiller.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.740]   About half of those employees are probably at the Apple store.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.160]   That's a really big number.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:17.240]   But the most interesting thing to me if we scroll down a little bit is that they sold,
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:23.480]   we think they sold at around $1.7 billion worth of Apple watches.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.480]   That's by doing a little math.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:31.040]   You got to get out your calculator because Apple watches is in other products and other
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.080]   products grew from $8 billion to $10 billion in 2015.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.560]   So you use peakalk on the Apple TV to figure that out.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560]   I'm wondering, what is 8.1.6?
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   That's a lot of money.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.640]   I mean, it's a big business.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.760]   I wonder, we don't know how many of those were the gold edition and how many of them
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   were the sport and...
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.200]   Speaking of it, the Dubai store opened this weekend and people kept tweeting, "Srenity
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.760]   and I" saying that the gold watches were thrifty sellers.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.560]   Oh, I'm sure they were...
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560]   You wouldn't be surprised.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.160]   Flying out the doors in Dubai.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.560]   Apple Watch is doing...
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.240]   I would say that means it's doing okay, right?
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.800]   I think it was Neil Cybert or...
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.000]   I don't remember if it was Neil Cybert or maybe it was Ben Thompson was saying that
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.440]   it was roughly analogous to Fitbit, which is currently the most public leader in that
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440]   space.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.960]   Actually, Ben's going to be on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.520]   So we'll query him.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.520]   He's always...
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.680]   Mark, I love his analysis.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.720]   Always interesting.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:36.520]   So what else from the annual report, Office Space, from 19.7 million square feet to 25
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.760]   million square feet?
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.440]   And that's not including the campus, the spaceship campus.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.440]   Or the one they're leasing.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.440]   They got a new one.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.720]   Yeah, they got a second one they're building.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]   And they had...
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.720]   I think they said 30% Android...
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.640]   Was a 30% increase or just 30% Android switcher rate in that...
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.760]   Tim Cook said that 30% of the new iPhone sales were two Android switchers.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.680]   Which is a good number for Apple.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   It's a great number.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.640]   Well, it's also good because it's given us an analyst call.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.280]   A lot of the complaints that Apple is getting from the market is saying, "Yeah, but you're
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.760]   all of your money's being made off of this one product.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.000]   What happens when you've sold an iPhone to everybody?"
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   It's not so much...
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.880]   A lot of us might hear it as...
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.560]   See, a lot of people would much rather switch from Android to the iPhone if they got a
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560]   chance.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.280]   It's really Apple saying there are so many people out there we have not sold an iPhone
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280]   to yet.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   They're so...
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.600]   The China still buys more iPhones than the United States of America.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:40.000]   So I think it's mostly pointing to we have gone through and we have taken the gold nuggets
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.440]   that were lying at the top of the soil and now we're starting to dig to get more of the
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   nuggets that were immediately visible.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:55.360]   Do you want to comment on the Bloomberg piece saying that Apple by focusing on privacy is
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.720]   hurting its development of its AI software?
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.600]   We've kind of been saying that really in some ways.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.960]   There's two ways to look at this.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:09.120]   One is that right now we understand AI mostly from a Google point of view and that is even
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.080]   an Amazon point of view and that is a massive cloud implementation where Apple...
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.440]   Oh, Montreal, nice.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.560]   Where Apple is looking at it and saying that there's actually following their near line
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.160]   strategy with they've been doing with a lot of things.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.340]   There's actually an online component but there's a local component and there's things
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.120]   that we can do on the cloud but we don't have to do them on the cloud.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.920]   Yeah, certain things have to be done there and we'll disclose those and say we're not
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.560]   sharing them and whatnot.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.840]   But the devices in your pockets are getting so powerful that we can do a lot of this work
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   on the local device.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.760]   We don't have to snoop on you in order to do this.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.760]   And that's a choice.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.920]   And we saw recently that Google, which was resisting doing Facebook style advertising
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.400]   for a long time is now starting to get into that because Facebook is getting an advantage
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.160]   and that's one thing you can do.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.260]   But I just don't think Apple's model is fully understood yet and I think the entire model,
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.660]   if you go five or ten years out, the state of what a device is, what an app is and what
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.740]   a service is is going to change so fundamentally.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.740]   And when you see Apple's acquisitions, which is doing local A, like they bought a company
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:10.140]   that specializes in local AI and they have all features like Genius which does not very
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.580]   good yet but could one day do very good local predictions.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.780]   I think it's very early to start worrying about this kind of stuff.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:20.260]   This article though also said that part of AI's improvement comes from being in a collegial
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:27.420]   environment where you give papers, you go to conferences and Apple's kind of secrecy
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.660]   is partly as kind of traditional but partly I think they don't want people to know how
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.300]   much they're doing on AI.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:38.700]   For instance, according to this article, new hires on the AI teams are told, don't put
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:42.580]   your title in your LinkedIn or Twitter bio.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:44.580]   We don't want anybody to know what you're working on.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.460]   They've been told to lock their office doors whenever they leave.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.780]   That's probably a standing order to all Apple employees.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.700]   Well, yeah, that's a lot of that isn't so unusual for any Apple employee.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:59.500]   But I do think AI is a complicated field right now.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:05.740]   There's a lot of concern and I think rightfully so over just how potentially dangerous meddling
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.340]   in AI could get down the road.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.540]   I'm saying don't meddle in AI.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.340]   People are meddling with my stuff way too often.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.340]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.740]   So Andy Anaco is not AI.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:20.700]   We're talking artificial intelligence AI.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.340]   Don't meddle in the name of the stuff.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:24.340]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.940]   I drop a CPU cycle every time those initials are said this conversation.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.540]   I never thought of that Andy.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.540]   Sorry.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540]   We'll call it all your official intelligence.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:36.820]   What's ironic serenity is that this was a category that was deemed dead a few years
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.820]   ago.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.500]   I mean, a failed category.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.580]   People assumed that it would never it would never work out.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:48.540]   And now in the last six, seven years, there's been a huge, I mean, I would say it's actually
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.980]   been the last 20 years, but we've really only been hearing about it in the last six,
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.540]   seven years because of the individual breakthroughs that have been able to occur both with hardware
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.340]   processing and with systematic language.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:05.380]   But you look at all of the AI startups that are popping up like Viv.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:10.980]   And you really have to wonder, you know, is Apple's secrecy because they want to try,
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.940]   they want to try and get one over the rest of the AI community because they want, they
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.980]   want it to be better than Cortana or better than, than Google, Google now.
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:23.100]   And unfortunately, with their commitment to privacy, which I do think is critical and
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:30.940]   a key component of, of their AI platform, but with, with that, with that stroke, they
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:35.140]   have sort of limited themselves in the amount of data that they can collect versus their
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.220]   opponents.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.740]   And as a result, they, I think they have to try and find different and new ways of doing
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.100]   things uniquely.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.700]   And they may not want to share that information, which is, I do think that's a little frustrating,
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:53.820]   especially considering, again, considering the potential hazards of artificial intelligence,
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:57.660]   that's one of those things where maybe it might be good to collaborate a little bit,
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.260]   not give away the farm.
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.780]   But you know, I mean, Apple always sent, Apple always sent people to ebook conferences,
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.460]   for example, when they were working on the EPUB standard.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.820]   They've worked on the WebKit standard.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.100]   And in, so, like, Apple has a history of sending researchers and sending their engineers to
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:17.420]   conferences when you're talking about working on standards and working on things that potentially
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.380]   could affect a wide swath of people.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:23.860]   But because AI is so proprietary right now, I think it really has been siloed into these
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:29.940]   little, little different cylinders and that Apple really can't, I don't, I don't know
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.860]   if they feel like they can contribute without worrying that someone's going to not necessarily
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.820]   steal their research, but reincorporate their research and potentially put them even further
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.860]   behind in some ways than Google now.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:48.100]   I think a lot of the complaining is coming from academicians who say, you know, Apple's
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.780]   not presenting papers, Apple's not sharing their results because that's the tradition
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.780]   in academia.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.820]   But of course, the tradition in Silicon Valley is exactly the opposite.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:02.900]   And the question is, can you make progress without collaborating with others working in
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.900]   your field?
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.620]   Well, Apple, knowing Apple figures it can.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.540]   And I think it's, I think you make it an excellent point, Renee, that they're taking a different
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.540]   path.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:16.620]   So maybe this kind of going off on a different road might be a, might be great.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:21.340]   You know, researchers may say, you know, big data doesn't help as much as the little data
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.340]   in your phone.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.340]   You know, who knows?
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.340]   We'll see.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.340]   Well, yeah.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.460]   And it's something that I would like, because it's the same thing with everything.
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   I don't want this to be done yet.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:31.620]   I want people trying and experimenting with new things because you can come up with great
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.620]   new answers.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620]   Everyone was doing the same thing.
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.620]   We'd all get the same.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.940]   We'd have a choice of exactly the same problem now.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.940]   If you, for some reason, you believe it is not your business to know my data and I'm
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:44.620]   willing to live with less functionality, different functionality with the idea that
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.420]   I'm preserving my own data, that's fine for me.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:48.860]   And I'm glad that we have a well-funded company doing that.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:53.460]   Even Apple, and I noticed this with the Apple TV, but even Apple is always asking when you
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:57.260]   set up a new phone, would you like to share diagnostic information with Apple?
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:58.260]   Yes or no?
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.460]   Would you like to share information about app use with app developers?
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.220]   Yes or no?
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.140]   I mean, so it's pretty clear that that information is of use.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.900]   And I don't know about you, but I almost always say, "Yes, when Microsoft Windows 10
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.900]   asked, do you want to just turn everything on?"
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.180]   I said, "Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:19.340]   I want Cortana to know where I am, what I'm doing, what movies I like."
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   That's good.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.340]   I don't like that they have the choice of.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   Microsoft knows that.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.340]   But I love the habit of the choice.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:29.820]   I think everybody should have the choice, but I get so much benefit out of aggregating
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.460]   all as much data about me as possible.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.620]   I'm willing to take that chance.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.060]   I find it hard to find what the moral harm is.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.140]   Well, I'm with my name.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:46.140]   Some people are going to be, I choose to see it as a transaction, just like my transaction
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.700]   paying a dollar in a night's sense for this yesterday.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.700]   I'd love to really go.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.940]   I was happy for that.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.740]   But other people are going to be a little bit more concerned about that.
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:01.460]   The other component about this though is that it's not just Cortana learning a lot about
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.460]   you.
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:09.820]   When Google servers are able to observe hundreds of millions of people and you personally visit
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:14.820]   Disney World, it's going to give you information and recommendations, not based on your habits,
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.180]   but based on what is every human being who goes to Disney World, what do they want to
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.740]   go to and do first?
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:24.420]   So that's again, available to some people who want to make a transaction.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:30.180]   So it's bad to simply slam the door and saying that Apple is stupid for being so closed up.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.020]   It's also bad to say that Google are jerks for trying to get every piece of information
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.220]   that you possibly can.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:39.620]   Again, read the outside of the box before you open it up.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.900]   There's a third side where people, and it's increasingly common, there were some hilarious
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.020]   interviews with McCaffee about this kind of stuff where the value of the data that we're
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:52.500]   providing Facebook and Twitter and Google might be so great that they should be paying
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.500]   us for.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.660]   It's not just that they're giving us a subsidized phone or they're giving us a great free service,
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.260]   but it could be valuable enough where they should be putting $100 in our pockets every
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.020]   month for getting access to all this data.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   That's fine.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020]   Go ahead and negotiate that deal.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:07.180]   Yeah, no, but it's just like what it's difficult for humans.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.940]   It's really simple to understand, here's my wallet.
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.180]   I'm giving you this money.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.780]   Thank you for this shiny box.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.260]   Or I'm getting this Linux distro and I can see the clock ticking away as I install it.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.820]   We're understanding that transaction.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:21.020]   When data is just flying back and forth, we don't always know what the value is.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.980]   You don't see your email and your pictures and all of us have going up into Google's
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.660]   cloud and being chonked.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.580]   It's nice that if you can understand that you're not doing anything for free, you're
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.300]   still giving them something in exchange for all these services and you decide on how much
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.540]   value that has to you.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.180]   To be fair, that does go in every direction too.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:45.780]   We can't assign a dollar value to how much money, let's say, how much of Apple's profits
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:50.820]   is based on the fact that they make it so hard for people to maintain an ecosystem that
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:53.780]   includes more non-Apple products.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:59.060]   It pays to remember that no matter what you think positively or negatively about a company,
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.940]   you can't use the software inside your head.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:04.980]   You use it to evaluate human behavior and try to make it work with corporations because
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.900]   again, no matter how good the commercials are, no matter how great their products are, no
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:12.140]   matter what your relationship is with that company, that company does not love you.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.940]   They just want your money.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:18.500]   Sometimes getting your money is also mutually supportive because they can give you something
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.580]   that you will value even more than the money that you give them.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.820]   But there's always going to be at some point a conversation inside the office saying, how
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:31.260]   does this help us get more money from Andy Anaco or Renee Ritchie or Serenity Caldwell?
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.900]   Or Star Wars, more money.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.100]   Well, they're going to get it anyway.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.220]   I'm not even pretending any of that.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.220]   Let's take a break.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.700]   I'm going to try to get more money out of you right now.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:48.100]   Andy Anaco here from the Chicago Sun Times with Serenity Caldwell from iMore.com.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.980]   And of course, Renee Ritchie also from iMore.com.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:57.060]   And there is a lot more to talk about including the iPad Pro.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.300]   Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.940]   Everybody I think who watches our shows loves to learn, right?
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:05.940]   You're curious.
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:09.380]   You want to know more about the outside world.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.460]   Maybe because it helps you at your work.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.820]   Maybe because it helps you be better at the things you love, like photography or using
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.820]   a Mac.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.500]   Lynda.com is right up your alley.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.500]   It's for problem solvers.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.500]   It's for the curious.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:26.060]   It's for people who want to make things happen, who want to get a better job or get a raise.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:30.260]   If you love photography, if you want to learn how to develop an iOS app, if you want to get
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.060]   better at Excel or master Photoshop, everything's there.
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:40.820]   Their latest courses is getting started with After Effects 2015, up and running with Premier
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:46.500]   Elements 14, up and running with Foto Magico.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:52.380]   I never heard of Foto Magico and then I found out that's an app, right?
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.140]   That's pretty impressive that they're doing stuff for apps as well.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:00.140]   Music, production, secrets, up and running with Fruity Loops with FL Studio 12.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:04.780]   Of course, there's always that great Bert Monroix Pixel Playground series.
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:05.780]   Love that.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:10.740]   If you're learning Photoshop from Bert Monroix, you're learning from the best.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.140]   It's all in one show of self-contained Photoshop or Illustrator project.
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:20.020]   The Foto Tools Weekly Show with Jan Kabili, where you can learn new image editing techniques
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.940]   in just a few minutes.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.980]   It's great because Linda.com has given you full-length courses where you can become an
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:31.260]   expert at something, but they're giving you short little sips that you can take to become
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.460]   better at one little skill.
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.460]   It's a great variety.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.660]   We're going to give you 10 days free so you can do both.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.220]   You can take a whole course beginning to end or you can try a little bit at a time.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:44.140]   Even the big courses you can do that because they have transcripts you can search and jump
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.500]   right to the part you want to learn.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.740]   I'm not a professional coder, but I love programming.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.980]   It's my hobby.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.820]   So I love taking courses on coding.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.140]   I'm learning Swift at Linda.com.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.220]   You can too.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.420]   It's just fabulous.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.060]   Linda, L-Y-N-D-A.com.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:07.300]   If you go to Linda.com/MacBreak, 10 days free, the run of the place, you get a sense
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.420]   of what you can do, how you could use it.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.900]   And I love Linda because they don't make you declare a major.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.420]   Your monthly fee gives you access to every single course.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:22.700]   So you can dip into the courses, try stuff there it is, creating a simple iOS app.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.700]   Anybody could do this.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.860]   They have one for Apple Watch too.

[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.580]   You know what?
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:34.740]   You could do this whole course easily in 10 days and come out at the other end with an
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.020]   iOS app that you wrote your very own self.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.020]   Isn't that fantastic?
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:45.460]   Linda.com/MacBreak, we thank them for their support of MacBreak.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.460]   Weekly.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.260]   So, the rumor mill says 11/11 for iPad Pro.
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.900]   Is that what you're hearing Renee?
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.140]   Sounds good.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:58.700]   I mean, at this point, if it's starting to, if it gets this close, then retail has it
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.580]   and it's hard to change at that point.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.980]   They're getting trained is what some are saying, right?
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:05.540]   Yeah, Mark Herman, I think, had the 11th as his date.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.380]   He's really good with retail services.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:12.620]   And by the way, that means not merely that we'll be able to pre-order, but we could actually
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.380]   pick one up on November 11th.
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:18.540]   I mean, everyone who pre-ordered the Apple TV might have been better off just walking
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.540]   in on Friday.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.100]   Yeah, that's what I did.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:30.540]   On like 12.01 AM on Friday, it switched over from come back later to find out if the in-store
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.260]   pickup is available to...
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.260]   Yeah, we got it.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.860]   See it, see it, see it, nine.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.860]   Is that the difference with this?
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:36.860]   Is this more of a niche product?
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.380]   So I don't know what the availability, like the Apple TV, they had cartons full of that.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.940]   I don't know how many iPad Pros.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:45.060]   I wouldn't dissuade anybody if you really, really, really want one.
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:48.100]   Go and get it on pre-order and then if it happened at the store, go pick it up and cancel
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.100]   the pre-order.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.660]   It is the price of an open computer, so it's not a...
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.660]   It's expensive, yeah.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.660]   We're talking...
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.540]   I mean, I think that the 32 gig version is really one of those just, you know, starts
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:28:59.540]   at.
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.860]   That what you're going to want is the 128 gig version plus a pencil.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:07.340]   The 32 is meant for companies like Pixar who are just going to put them on every desk
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.660]   and don't need LTE and things like that.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:10.660]   Right, yeah.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.940]   But that does mean that it's a good point.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.180]   It's not so much they're not going to have them, but they're not going to have 128 gig
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.580]   ones of them.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:19.580]   So unless you're...
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:25.500]   I'm wondering if the ones that are going to sell out first are the ones without GPS
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.460]   and LTE or whether it's the LTE ones that are going to sell out first, either way I'm
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.460]   probably...
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   The most expensive will go really fast.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.460]   Well, there's...
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.180]   At some point, if you...
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.900]   I'm planning on getting one early.
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:41.380]   I'm just going to go and buy one because it just makes so much sense for me, whether
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:44.020]   I get a loaner on day one or not.
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.820]   But it's...
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:51.580]   I might be interested enough in it to say if the only one that I can get is the LTE
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.580]   model.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:55.020]   Okay, let's spend the X-No.
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020]   I will...
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.740]   I keep telling people it's okay to wait to get something.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:01.420]   So I'll have to remind myself of that and not get it.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:02.420]   What is it about the...
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.100]   Why is it this fits your needs so well, Andy?
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:13.140]   It's because it's a very, very specific set of reasons because I already have a 13-inch
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.380]   MacBook.
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.260]   So when I want to, as this week I've got a lot of real work to do and I need to grind
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.100]   through it, I've got something that I can easily toss into a bag and carry through two
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.540]   airports on a Monday afternoon.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.100]   I already have an iPad mini.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:35.820]   So when I really want iOS, tablet and productivity apps super portable, I've got that.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:41.820]   I think the iPad Pro, I think, will let me do a bunch of things that I can't do already.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:47.860]   One of which is to have that super light, super long-lasting device and still be productive
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.980]   on a big, comfortable screen.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:57.740]   Not only that, but I don't have a Mac, an Apple device that has a pen input like that.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:59.860]   I like to draw, I like to do it all.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   I'm not good at it, but I would do more of it if I had that device with me.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.700]   And the last thing is situations exactly like this one.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700]   Here I am.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.820]   As my friend I tweeted out a picture of my setup here.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:17.740]   Not only would I be able to enjoy the iPad on the flight over, but even when I travel
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:25.060]   with this MacBook, I will have that 13-inch screen using one of any different pieces of
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:30.500]   software on the side of this computer as a second display for my Mac.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:36.700]   So I really think that even just as an air display, even as a big iOS thing.
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.820]   And the last thing, Comixology.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.340]   I read comic books.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.740]   I buy and read comic books every single week.
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.940]   It was the one thing.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:48.060]   Even Windows 8.0 as bad as it was.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:55.620]   I have a Samsung touch tablet and I'm like, I don't like Windows 8 very much, but I like
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:32:01.300]   being able to read Comixology, Comix at exactly publication size or greater.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:07.500]   So it's not as though there's $900 worth of value in any one feature, but sometimes
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.260]   you really do the math thing.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:13.540]   It's worth it for me to have $200 for a portable second display for my PC.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.900]   It's worth it to get, spend $180 for a big comic book reader.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.940]   It's worth it to spend $300 for an art tablet.
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:24.620]   And you do all the math and that adds up to, for me, at least $80 more than the purchase
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.300]   price of 128 gig Wi-Fi.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:32.860]   I'll say one last thing.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:37.660]   Part of it is an investment in putting my money where my mouth is.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:42.780]   I really think that computers like the iPad Pro are absolutely the next generation.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:49.820]   It's the idea of we're going to have a CPU that is not as screaming fast on the bench
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.340]   as other CPUs, but we're going to manage it and operate it so efficiently that it will
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:57.860]   run as fast as a liquid cooled desktop machine.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:03.220]   We're going to have apps that are really purposeful and built to take advantage of its location,
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:07.220]   excuse me, of its context and how you're actually using things.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:12.940]   And I feel as though, just like a lot of us, not me because I was too young to have a $3,000
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:17.580]   computer, a lot of people bought the first Mac not because it was really ready for prime
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:22.060]   time, but because it obviously was pointing the direction of what all computing should
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:25.300]   be like in the next two, three, four, five or 10 years.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.500]   I think the iPad Pro, and this is, I'm not, obviously this isn't based on actual hands-on
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.500]   review.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:37.180]   It feels as though if I want us to move past this idea of there is a screen, there is
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.620]   a keyboard and we will type on the keyboard while we watch the screen.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.420]   If you want that to move forward, we're going to have to encourage people to make devices
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.420]   like that.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.380]   Maybe it's more like the first Tesla than the first Mac, but that's the source of what
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.380]   I'm talking about.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.660]   No, that's an interesting point.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:55.380]   So it's almost as if you're willing for it not to be perfect, not to have all the software
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:59.540]   you want, but I want to support this platform.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.700]   If not for the, I wouldn't make that a factor.
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:07.660]   I'm not, I don't make nearly enough money to just, it's not a donation.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:13.940]   Trying to support a company that has $200 billion in cash, but if not for the fact that like
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:16.500]   I said, there are all kinds of specific things.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:21.340]   I always say that if you're considering a new piece of hardware, a new piece of tech,
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.700]   it needs to do one or both of these things.
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:27.340]   It needs to either solve a problem or create an opportunity.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:32.060]   And for me, the iPad Pro, I think will both create, solve a problem for me and create an
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.060]   opportunity.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:37.900]   So tempted to buy a Surface Pro 4 because it really is fantastic, but it really did come
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:44.620]   down to I don't necessarily, for my personal uses, I don't want a desktop operating system
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:50.500]   inside my ultra light big tablet for my personal uses.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:56.460]   Given that my other, my desktop OS is a Mac, I would rather have an iOS device.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:59.580]   If I were a window shop, then I think it would be the opposite.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.180]   I think there's nothing that could stop me from buying a Surface Pro.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.980]   And I mentioned it before that the Surface Book has really convinced me of the value of
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:11.660]   a Touch OS, even with Windows not being the ideal Touch OS.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:17.940]   Do you think this is the beginning of a transition to iOS for Apple?
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.660]   Well, look at the flight time, OS.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.020]   Well, look at the pie chart.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:27.180]   Apple has already transitioned into being at least monetarily an iOS company.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.900]   I think that we're still far, far away from a world in which people can get all the stuff
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.500]   done that they need to get done with the computer solely through a tablet.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.580]   I think that we're very, very close to the point where we can do it solely through a
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:46.700]   phone, but I'm not sure that we're just going to see a elimination of keyboards anytime
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:47.700]   soon.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:52.020]   There are just too many things that if you want to interact with this for more than 43
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:55.780]   minutes, at some point you've got to get a keyboard and hook it up to that thing, which
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.380]   is why the magic keyboard is so desperately disappointing.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   Okay.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:05.860]   Renee and Serenity are either of you not going to buy it and why is it not for you if that's
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.860]   the case?
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.260]   Well, I'm definitely going to buy it.
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.260]   Oh, crap.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.260]   I'm not you, Renee.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.820]   Are you not going to buy it?
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820]   They had me at pencil.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   Oh, crap.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.100]   I have never used a stylus input device that worked as well as the pencil did on the
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   eye.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:25.220]   And what flabbergasted me is that I've used Waccom for a decade and their stuff has
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.220]   gotten better.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:29.140]   But what Apple did first time out of the gate and granted they've been working on it behind
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.580]   the scenes for a couple of years, but first time out of the gate is incredibly impressive.
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:34.580]   Go ahead, Serenity.
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.660]   No, no, I mean to cut you off just because you're going to buy one.
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.060]   I'm going to buy one.
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.420]   Therefore, my opinion is irrelevant.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:46.140]   No, I was going to, you know, speculating on what this device may not be, you know,
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.780]   who this device may not be for.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:53.060]   For one thing, if you just bought an iPad Air 2 and you don't necessarily need like
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:57.780]   if you still like carrying an iPad and a laptop, which some people do.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:03.220]   Some people really enjoy the iPad mini form factor with a Macbook Pro or a Macbook.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:08.660]   And I really do feel like the iPad Pro is much more of a laptop replacement than a laptop
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.860]   augmented.
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:13.820]   It seems like the type of device that would work really, really well with an iMac.
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:19.700]   And especially if you use a software like Astropad, which allows you to turn your iPad
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:25.020]   display into a multi-touch and pressure sensitive display for your Mac, you essentially have
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.860]   a Cintiq tablet there.
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:32.140]   But to me, it makes less sense if you want to get it as a laptop augmented.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:36.940]   You wouldn't want to carry around an iPad Pro and a 13-inch Macbook Pro.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.020]   And I'm not an artist.
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:44.020]   So I, you know, while I love the, but I love the idea of being able to draw and all that
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.020]   stuff.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.020]   It's not.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.940]   I mean, I think I don't want to get one.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:53.580]   I probably will, but I don't want to get one because I'm afraid I'm going to be mightily
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.580]   disappointed.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:57.620]   I think the range of apps that take advantage of it will be small.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:04.540]   And as a fan of technology start and maybe, well, one doesn't know how many apps will
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:05.540]   come out later.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:06.740]   It's just not, it's unpredictable.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.860]   So there's a fan of technology.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:13.020]   Like I just want to get my hands on that A9X and I want to get my hands on that pencil.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:18.260]   I think Apple is, Apple is $1,000 arguably, arguably the leader in Silicon.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:21.060]   Like I would not have said that last year because I think Intel was still doing interesting
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.060]   things.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.620]   But what Apple has managed to do in the span of just a few years is incredible.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.820]   And I want to, and this is the craziest chip they've ever shipped.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.820]   And I want to try it out.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   I want to see what it can do.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.740]   I want to see, they've never done a stylus before.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.820]   I was incredibly impressed by the tilt sensitivity and by the accuracy.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.980]   And I want to see what they can do.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:41.620]   So this to me is, it's like Andy, it's optimistic, it's an investment in the future, but it's
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:47.780]   also an incredible nerd curiosity over how close Apple can get to this sort of multi-purpose,
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.060]   multi-functional productivity, creativity.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.340]   And just for, like my mom is going to get one because she uses her iPad as her primary
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.540]   computer and she still doesn't use her Mac very often and she's an artist.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.540]   So she's, this is going to be the best computer she's ever owned.
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:03.020]   For creatives, I have no doubt, you know?
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:05.180]   And I am an aspiring photographer.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:08.220]   It does look like it'll be a really interesting kind of Lightroom machine.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.220]   It'll be a really interesting.
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:10.740]   Three streams of 4K Leo?
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:11.740]   Yeah, video.
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.340]   I mean, it would be really fun to edit video on this.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.860]   Is this, do you know this app that they're showing on the page?
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.380]   That's not an iMovie, is it?
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   I think that is.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   That looks like iMovie.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.380]   Wow.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.380]   Wow.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.180]   Yeah, see that might be kind of fun to edit an entire movie with your finger.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.180]   I love it.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:31.100]   I did it with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.100]   I do it all the time for iMore.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:37.780]   And I do it occasionally on the iPhone or on the iPad.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:43.660]   The 6S Plus is actually really easy to edit with, but with the iPad Pro, what's really
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:47.060]   nice is you're going to have triple stream video editing.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:52.460]   You're basically going to have techniques that are close to high level iMovie low level
[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:55.940]   final cut Pro on a touchscreen device.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:01.140]   And I actually much prefer editing with a touchscreen than editing with a mouse or with
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.140]   a trackpad.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.660]   It feels much more natural and much quicker to do so.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:08.900]   So I'm really looking forward to the potential that's there.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.660]   I think I'm with Andy there.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.100]   I don't think that you're right, Leo.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:16.540]   There's not going to be a lot of must have apps on day one.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.740]   It's going to be a device that evolves.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.020]   And that's actually what intrigues me because it's going to be released essentially as a
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:28.100]   blank slate as, all right, let's see what we can do with this.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:33.860]   That allows both developers and users to figure out what the best use case is and petition
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860]   Apple.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.420]   I think iOS 9 and split screen and slide over.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:42.580]   This is all stuff that came from users and developers petitioning Apple and basically
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:49.420]   being saying, you know, I really love the iPad, but it needs some kind of multitasking.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.460]   It needs to be better, to be faster.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.980]   If you buy this, you have to buy the pencil, right?
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.220]   I mean, obviously you don't, but you should.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.820]   You don't, but you should.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.700]   I mean, how about the keyboard?
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.700]   No.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.700]   No.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:02.700]   This is going to be so much harder.
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:03.700]   It's going to be so much harder.
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:04.700]   It's exactly.
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.940]   There are going to be so much better third party cases than that.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:09.260]   I haven't, I've never touched that keyboard.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.260]   I have used a couple of different keyboards that use that kind of design and they are
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:16.340]   fine for 41 minutes, 42 minutes.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:21.180]   You're going to wish you got to Kensington, got to Logitech bought a lovely Camch, a
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.180]   clamshell case.
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.140]   The day that the iPad Pro was announced, I was getting press releases from a lot of
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:30.940]   major players that were not able to show me, of course, the pictures of this wonderful
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:34.060]   keyboard case they were designing because they just heard about this the day before
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:35.220]   themselves.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.820]   But they were certainly eager to do it.
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:43.020]   There is another thing that is kind of interesting about all this.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.180]   There's a battle that really has to be fought.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:51.300]   Here we have a device that is cost, the cost like a laptop.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.940]   And certainly I think most of the people who buy it, even if they're buying it as a creative
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:42:00.060]   device, are going to be anticipating desktop style apps to come out for it in terms of
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:03.860]   what you can do with it, not just, you know, crossy road, although it's going to be awesome
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:06.260]   12.9 inch screen.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:09.580]   But they're going to expect to get to make money and get value out of it.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.460]   How many different sized screens can we play?
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460]   Crossy road on.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.460]   Let's find out.
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.460]   Let's find out.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:15.460]   Let's find out.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:22.940]   But, and so in the desktop realm, people are used to spending 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, $100,
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:26.300]   $200, 20 bucks a month for productivity apps.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:28.140]   But it is an iPad and runs iOS.
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:32.700]   And that's a world where people have just a stupid amount of friction against paying
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:35.140]   more than $4.99 for something.
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:39.100]   So I'm hoping that it's not going to be the case where developers aren't going to be
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:44.660]   interested in writing software that takes full advantage of the iPad on the same scale
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.860]   that there's such a huge library of apps for the iPad because the iPhone, because they
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.420]   are going to worry that we have to try to pay all the people that, and for all the time
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.540]   we're going to be putting into this, we're going to have to charge $50 for this ARDAAP
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:03.140]   and we can't, and we don't think that we can sell something that's an iOS app for $50.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:06.500]   I guess I have to buy one now.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:12.420]   I think it's amazing that, what a great testimony Apple's doing.
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:14.580]   Leo's a CEO, so he doesn't really count.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.180]   But the three of us, we're journalists, we make no money, we're cheapskates.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:22.700]   And the three of us are saying, we want to buy the version, and not only that, we're
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:26.340]   tech journalists, we know that the version one of anything you should stay away from.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.980]   And we're going to be on the pavement like with blankets wrapped around us in Boston,
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.220]   you know, trying to make sure that if there's four iPad pros for sale, we're one of the
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.900]   first three in line.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.620]   Yep.
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:43.340]   It's not just a big iPad is what you're saying.
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:44.540]   No, iPad on my Mac.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.460]   I think it's the start of something different.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.460]   It's the start of something different.
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:54.220]   I don't, yeah, and it's going to take some time to have it, truly figure out where it
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:44:00.140]   falls in the ecosystem, but I think it is a really great first reinvention by Apple now
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:05.940]   to figure out where the iOS, you know, specifically the tablet revolution is going.
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:09.940]   I guess I'll be at an Apple store on November 11th.
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:11.700]   Say how it was.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.940]   Sorry, not sorry.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:15.940]   You talked me into it.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:16.940]   I was really trying to resist.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:19.700]   I know, I mean, I'm buying, we have to buy it for review.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:22.620]   So I'm going to buy one for Megan for iOS today.
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.700]   And I have the new mini.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:28.740]   I thought, well, I just use my new mini, but then my wife says she has to have one.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.540]   Now you guys are talking about just you just talking to a $3,000 purchase.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.540]   Horrible people.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:34.540]   You horrible horror.
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:41.220]   What you're running up to five and buy one for me and I should get one for Christmas
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:45.060]   present for all of the people that really make such a difference in this network.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.780]   Actually, maybe I will.
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:47.780]   I'll take a look at this.
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:48.780]   We already bought a few.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:50.620]   I bought you funny hats.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.780]   What more do you want?
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.660]   I know.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.340]   I want a Twitter hard button.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.100]   Leo, how about that?
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.500]   I can do that.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.220]   Yet the Twitter now doesn't have stars.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.220]   It has arts.
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.220]   Yep.
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.220]   How dare they?
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:09.460]   The fact that that's a major news story tells you when we should be talking about one
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.340]   drives new price hike and we're all we're talking to talk.
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:15.620]   Holy cow, one drive screw you Microsoft.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.700]   I think so many of us because Microsoft said if you get the Office 365 subscription, you
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.900]   will have infinite storage on one drive.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:29.860]   Many of us, Paul Therat ended up putting everything on there, all his music and everything.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.220]   Now, you're still going to get it terabyte, but they backed off.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.380]   They said, no, we changed our mind.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:37.620]   Too many of you were misusing it, which I find hard to believe.
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:42.340]   I really don't think that that's a small number.
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:45.260]   They quoted people putting hundreds of terabytes.
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:48.900]   Remember, you still have to upload it.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:52.340]   It takes time.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.540]   Terabyte is a lot of storage.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:46:00.340]   Maybe Amazon decided, hey, we can use this for AWS and do the markup.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.340]   Maybe that's what's going on.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.340]   I don't know.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:05.340]   Anyway, Microsoft backed up on that.
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:06.700]   And I heart it.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:09.300]   Yes, I did not heart the Microsoft backup.
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:12.340]   No, I don't heart it, but see, we don't have any choice.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.420]   I could favorite it.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:15.180]   I like favorite.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.580]   Heart implies a judge.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:17.580]   You like it.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.340]   I don't want to heart it, by the way.
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.460]   Should be a bookmark button.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:24.700]   I know so many women who are good at this, and I am just.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.740]   So use your thumb or your palms.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.340]   Oh, oh.
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.900]   That's the other trick.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:35.100]   Oh, yes, see, I can't do it like Renee does it.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.180]   I got to go back to this one.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.540]   I don't know.
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:38.500]   Error error error.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.500]   This one's hard.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:40.980]   I'm like this one at all.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:42.900]   Yeah, I can't do it either.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.940]   I'm going to prefer the hearts.
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:45.780]   OK.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.580]   Keep something out.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.220]   Go to orange.
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.820]   Most of the people who are listening to the show
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.700]   don't know what's going on at all now.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:51.700]   What is that?
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:54.580]   So she's saying put your palm, touch your palms,
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.220]   and do a heart that is a lot easier to do it.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.220]   And then you can bring it.
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:00.220]   And then you do.
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.420]   Oh, you broke it.
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.780]   Yeah, Microsoft, you broke my heart.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:05.820]   That's it.
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.660]   I wouldn't go that far.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.580]   The Microsoft.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.980]   Before one, I don't know if Microsoft ever had my heart
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:11.140]   in the first place.
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:12.220]   I was using one drive.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:14.100]   I was taking it because I have Office 365,
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.540]   and I was taking the edge of all this storage.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.740]   But I didn't even when I'm uploading everything.
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.500]   I can't get to more than a terabyte.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.740]   So they're still giving you a terabyte.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.100]   I tried.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:23.700]   I tried.
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:26.540]   Just couldn't do it.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:29.860]   Our show today brought to you by ITPro.TV, a good ITPro,
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.540]   is always working on getting their skills up.
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:38.660]   Things are changing in the IT world so rapidly that if you
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.060]   went out and you got an A+ cert five years ago,
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.060]   I doubt you could get an A+ cert today.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:45.900]   I mean, that is how fast this stuff is changing.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.540]   Fortunately, it's easy to keep up with ITPro.TV.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.860]   And by the way, it's going to look awesome on your iPad Pro.
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:53.780]   They have a Roku app.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.060]   Looks good on my big screen TV as well.
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:00.660]   ITPro is kind of like Twit except they have two studios.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:03.100]   They do 50 hours of programming every week.
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:06.220]   Stream live and on demand to your Chromecast,
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.060]   to your computer, to your mobile device on your Roku.
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:11.900]   It's their second anniversary, and big things
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:13.940]   are happening at ITPro.TV.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:17.260]   30,000 members.
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:18.820]   And I'm guessing probably half of those
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.780]   heard about it first on that Twit.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:25.620]   75 countries, over 1,000 hours of content,
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.180]   two studios, 50 hours a week.
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:30.340]   And look at the course library to get an idea.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:33.140]   That's the Certified Ethical Hacker cert.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:34.820]   That's an awesome cert.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:38.380]   There's so much great stuff.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.460]   The iOS apps have been updated along with the Roku apps
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.340]   so that you can resume playback between devices.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:47.460]   The new website, which you're looking at right now,
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:49.700]   and the new interface with features
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.420]   like speeding up video and audio while watching courses
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:56.580]   so you can get more cram more into your brain faster.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:57.780]   Now they've upgraded.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.380]   They have the Transcender Practice exams included
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.500]   with your subscription.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.460]   That's a $135 value.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.220]   You also get over 100 step-by-step virtual machine
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:11.980]   labs, all new, all included with your membership.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:15.380]   This is the way to learn about IT,
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.300]   whether you're trying to get a job in the business
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.940]   or trying to keep your job.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.020]   Corporate group pricing available, of course.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:25.340]   Clients include Harvard, MIT, UCSD, Stanford.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.620]   Upgrow, grade your brain.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:29.660]   Go to ITPro.TV/Macbreak.
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:33.980]   Subscriptions are normally very affordable, $57 a month,
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:36.460]   or get two months free when you get an entire year,
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.020]   $570 bucks.
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.740]   But if you go to ITPro.TV/Macbreak
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.340]   and use the offer code MACBreak30,

[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.540]   your subscription forever.

[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.580]   Lamly live on ITPro TV recording his new course
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:01.900]   on Cisco Firepower, an advanced firesite administration.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.780]   Todd really should be in the Cisco Hall of Fame.
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.780]   He's a rock star when it comes to Cisco networking.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:08.460]   He's written over 25 books.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:12.140]   He'll be discussing his new book, SourceFire, SS-FIPs,
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:14.820]   Firepower with over a million copies in print.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:17.220]   That's a great class.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.660]   And you can watch that free, by the way.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.380]   November 9th through the 11th, if you have a free basic account,

[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.860]   But this is a great opportunity to see and chat.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:38.820]   They have a chat room, too, with Todd Lamly live.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:41.420]   And get his amazing advice on Cisco.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.940]   That by itself is worth some.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.540]   Visit ITPro.tv/MacBreak.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.540]   Don't forget that offer code MACBreak30.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:49.620]   It'll save you 30% on the cost of your subscription

[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.100]   ITPro.tv/MacBreak.
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:03.980]   It is time for our picks of the week.
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:06.380]   Let me start with Serenity Caldwell.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:07.020]   Serenity?
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.180]   All right.
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:12.380]   Well, I think I have to go with the Apple TV game
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:17.380]   that has been monopolizing my time for the past year.
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.460]   No, this is--
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:22.020]   No, honestly, oh, so this is not a new Apple TV game,
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.260]   or not a new game, rather.
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.740]   I believe it was on iOS first.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:26.260]   But Raymond Adventures has been playing--
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.380]   Oh, I've been playing, too.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:27.900]   It's so good.
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:28.620]   It's so much fun.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.020]   Yay!
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:34.060]   It reminds me entirely of the Sonic days of yours.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.420]   Yes.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.100]   You probably pull up a trailer from the iOS version.
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.180]   But on iOS, I've tried playing it on iOS,
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.700]   and I wasn't really into it with a game controller.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.540]   I need a controller.
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:44.100]   Like with the Nimbus.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.380]   Oh, it just feels so good.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:48.060]   And the levels are so darn hard.
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:51.820]   I've gotten to World 3 or World 4,
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.180]   and there's one that's a time trial that involves lava.
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:56.300]   And it's just--
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:59.100]   I'm a huge Rayman fan, and I played all of these games
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:03.220]   on the Xbox with a controller, or a real controller.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.460]   And they're so much fun.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:07.180]   And I was so glad to see it on the Apple TV.
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:08.220]   And I'm immediately bored.
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:09.700]   Yeah, must buy purchase.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.900]   If you like old side-scroller style games,
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.060]   Sonic or any of those kinds of puzzle racers, the clock,
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:20.220]   collect items, you'll love it.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.180]   You'll absolutely love it.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.340]   Great game.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:23.380]   Ubisoft.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.300]   It's French.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:29.060]   And it has a certain French genocet quo.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:31.620]   And how much is it, do you know?
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.100]   I think it's--
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.140]   You and I got it free, because we already
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:35.980]   bought it for iOS.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.940]   Rayman Adventures, we're going to find out right now.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.700]   I believe it's 4.99.
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.100]   Yeah, worth it.
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.500]   But I should check.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:45.060]   Or no, you know what?
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:45.660]   It's free.
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:46.500]   It is free.
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.300]   Oh, in-app purchases, yes.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.780]   In-app purchases, but you don't need in-app purchases
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.740]   to play it, which is delightful.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.220]   Yep.
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:58.940]   So now you know why you have to buy the 64-gig on Apple TV.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:52:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.220]   Renee, your pick of the week.
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.020]   I have to-- the first one sort of goes
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.660]   with what we were talking about a couple weeks ago
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:06.340]   when it comes to password managers
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.300]   and why you like LastPass so much,
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.980]   because it provided sort of a group environment.
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.380]   So one password, just a couple hours ago,
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.220]   announced one password for Teams.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.860]   So if you are a one password fan,
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:18.860]   but you've always wished that you could deploy that
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.260]   across your business, your company,
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:23.100]   or whatever sort of group you work with,
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.300]   they now have a solution for that.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:27.260]   I believe it's going into beta now.
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:28.780]   And it's going to roll out.
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:30.940]   I didn't have it-- I don't recall the date off hand.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.500]   I apologize.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.620]   But it'll let you do all the sorts of things
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:35.620]   that you want to do for password management in a group
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.940]   and a company in a team situation.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:40.900]   I was-- I tried all of the alternate password managers,
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.540]   because I'm worried about LastPass,
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:45.300]   and this was easily my favorite.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.660]   Yeah, if you were on the Apple ecosystem early on,
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.500]   it was just what you did, because it was available.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.220]   And they quickly rolled it out to every platform.
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:54.860]   Like they were on the watch day one.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:56.180]   It's just a terrific team.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.740]   They're always-- they're working really hard
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:59.060]   for the Apple community.
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.580]   I have not had a chance to try this yet,
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.100]   because they kept it utterly secret,
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.340]   like a good security company should, until noon today.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:06.380]   So that's just been announced.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.060]   So check that out if you're interested.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.300]   The other thing I wanted to bring up
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.220]   is what you and Serenity were talking about earlier,
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.580]   and that is the game controllers.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.860]   This is the SteelSeries Nimbus.
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:16.900]   And if you're a fan of console controllers,
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:17.380]   this is great.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.780]   It charges by lightning.
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.180]   So it already uses the same thing your Apple remote does.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:23.020]   And if you've got the new Magic Keyboard and trackpad,
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.300]   it charges the same way.
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.580]   It's got the dual analog sticks, and it's positioned
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.380]   in a way that humans should, not all strangely positioned.
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.460]   Like other game pads.
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.780]   It's got the four way.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:33.500]   It's got the buttons.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.660]   It's got the shoulder.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:36.340]   I'm holding this up for people listening on audio.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:36.980]   I apologize.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:38.260]   But it's got the triggers.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.020]   It's got the shoulder buttons.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.980]   It's got almost everything you could possibly want.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:45.180]   Short of Nintendo switching over and making hardware
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:47.220]   controllers for Apple TV, which I would love.
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:48.740]   It probably won't happen.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.220]   If you're looking for a controller,
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:53.460]   you can pair up to two of them, or if you have Bluetooth
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:54.580]   headphones up to one of them.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.260]   But you can pair them with your Apple TV,
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:57.540]   and you can play multiplayer games.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.060]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.740]   Yeah, I got the other steel case that uses regular batteries.
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.780]   Maybe the next one I'll get.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.380]   It'll be the rechargeable.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.180]   Rechargeable, isn't it?
[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:08.460]   I mean, there is something to be said for swapping batteries
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.100]   quickly if you forget about it.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.540]   But when you don't have batteries, it's even worse.
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:13.940]   So the ability to recharge it is super nice.
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.580]   They claim really good battery life.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.540]   So I'm waiting to see, you know, like months.
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:20.500]   And then the problem is it has an on/off switch.
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.700]   And of course, I know I'm going to forget to turn it off.
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.500]   So yeah.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.700]   I mean, I've had PlayStation controllers for so long
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.660]   that we're rechargeable that I think I'm just sort of used to it.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:33.060]   Also, it has an automatic off after 15 minutes.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.500]   Oh, it does.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:33.700]   OK.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.380]   There are no fun.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.740]   I don't even bother with the other stuff.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:37.780]   That's a reason to get it.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:38.140]   OK.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.340]   So it doesn't matter, even if it hasn't on/off switch,
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.300]   it doesn't matter.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.620]   I've only ever charged it once.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.260]   I mean, granted, I've only gotten over the weekend.
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:46.340]   But it's still at like 89%.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:46.820]   Well--
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:48.100]   And I've been playing with it a lot.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.500]   I've been playing a lot of Rayman, I could tell.
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.180]   Yeah, yes I have.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:52.620]   You're in the third world already.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.180]   Wow.
[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:56.740]   Andy and I, co, your pick of the week.
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.700]   Sometimes I like to re-recommend a pick
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.420]   that I picked a while ago because it has either renewed
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:07.740]   my faith in it or I stopped using it for reasons that may not
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:11.060]   have had anything to do with the app and have rediscovered it.
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.140]   And that's the case this week with Mars edit by Red Sweater
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.740]   software.
[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:20.700]   This is the offline Mac-based blog editor
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:23.860]   that works with WordPress and a couple other different blog
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:25.260]   formats.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:30.260]   When WordPress finally did a heroic level of upgrades
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.380]   to its built-in web editor, I kind of stopped using it.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:37.060]   Again, I never disliked Mars edit.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:41.260]   I just didn't decide that it was necessary.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:44.020]   I tried it again over the weekend.
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:47.260]   And it has been a real revelation.
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:48.500]   They've made a bunch of improvements
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.820]   since three or four years ago since the last time that I used it.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:53.860]   But also, it really reminded me of the difference
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:57.260]   between having a bespoke app for web posts
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:01.060]   and having to open up a web page in order to post things
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:04.020]   to the blog.
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:07.380]   There are so many hooks into Mac OS between this app
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.460]   that it makes it really, really easy
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:13.060]   to do short snappy little posts every time
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.300]   that I want to post just a simple link, for instance,
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:19.780]   and a comment about that link to my blog through the WordPress
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:20.660]   web app.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:23.460]   There were so many button clicks to make that happen
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.740]   that it's not as though it was tortuously in elegant.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.300]   It's just that it was a lot of steps
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:35.460]   and it kind of disabled my enthusiasm for,
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.500]   hey, that's a really great article I just read.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:38.980]   I think I'll share it on my blog.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.740]   Now it's like a 15-minute process to make it happen.
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:43.220]   And it's like, oh, that's not worth my--
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:44.700]   it's not a good enough article for me
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:47.380]   to spend 15 minutes doing a blog post about it.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:51.020]   With the bars that it takes all of 30 seconds
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.780]   and now I've been posting all kinds of stuff.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:55.060]   The other thing, which I didn't really figure on,
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.180]   is that sometimes you play a mind game with yourself
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:57:59.820]   when you're a writer.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:03.740]   I find that it was so hard for me to write short pieces
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:07.660]   in WordPress because for whatever reason,
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:09.380]   that sort of engages the--
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:13.180]   I'm a professional tech turtle.
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:14.860]   It has to be in-depth.
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:17.460]   It has to be very considered.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:23.020]   And so I would intend to just write a quick blurb about,
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.740]   here's why I recommended this article.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.660]   But it turned into, no, this has now inspired me
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.740]   to write 1,200 to 2,000 words on this topic.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:32.340]   That's why we love Twitter because you can't.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.180]   Exactly.
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:34.860]   As a matter of fact, that was the inspiration.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:37.420]   I was asking myself the question over the weekend.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:40.380]   Why is it that I can really crystallize a thought
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:43.060]   in 140 characters and I'm just giving thoughts, ideas,
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:45.460]   boom, boom, boom, posting to Twitter several times a day?
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:48.020]   Why do I not ever be able to do that on this thing?
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:50.420]   I figured that it was because there was too much friction.
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:52.460]   But to complete that earlier thought though,
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:55.780]   the cool thing about Mars edit is that for whatever reason,
[01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:57.660]   I'm just composing a quick blog post.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.500]   I know that people don't think of this as a column
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:01.860]   or as a big article that I'm writing.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.820]   So it's OK for me to just be two or three paragraphs long
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:07.220]   or to have a thought that just simply states something
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:09.980]   and moves away without really exploring in-depth.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:15.060]   So I said about technology, creating opportunities,
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:16.500]   or solving problems.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.820]   Again, this seemed to have been doing both for me,
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:21.500]   particularly on the creating opportunities
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:24.620]   because my blog has kind of laid in fallow
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:27.140]   because again, it's just too much of a--
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:30.060]   when I'm spending all day doing this anyway for the Sun
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:32.420]   Times or the places, it's hard for me to say, OK,
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.900]   and I'm going to write tech stuff and blog stuff for fun.
[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:37.780]   And this seems to help me with that.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:40.260]   I've got a super top secret project
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.940]   that I've been working on for a little while
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:45.820]   that this app is also going to really help me out with.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.620]   And the last thing about this, I like the fact
[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:52.660]   that he's charging $40 for a decent amount of money
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:54.540]   for a really, really good piece of software.
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:57.300]   It's getting now so that I'm actually
[01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:59.940]   happy when I see a developer, even for iOS,
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:02.300]   charging a decent amount of money for an app
[02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:04.820]   because I know that there is that much greater chance
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.020]   that this app is going to continue to be supported
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.940]   and continue to evolve and be improved as Mac OS
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.780]   and iOS continues to improve.
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:12.500]   I use it too.
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.180]   In fact, the only thing that really grapes me
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:16.180]   about switching from WordPress to Squarespace
[02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:17.860]   is it doesn't work with Squarespace.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:18.940]   It makes me--
[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:19.620]   I miss it.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:20.660]   I'll get better good on that.
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.140]   Yeah, JAL-C.
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:23.580]   I don't know.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.420]   The API, they took the API out of a Play Squarespace.
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.540]   And I guess because they have their own app, which is fine.
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:32.980]   But I really loved Mars edit.
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:35.420]   I used it all the time.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:36.540]   A lot of convenient features.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:38.820]   That plus Acorn was blogging heaven.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.940]   Have I?
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:42.660]   I can't remember.
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:45.380]   Did I pick the Ricoh Theta camera,
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:47.860]   or did I just talk about it?
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.180]   Because this is definitely a pick.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:49.380]   I have now--
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:50.540]   I don't pick.
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:51.620]   Have I picked it?
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.620]   I don't think you have it.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:53.140]   I don't remember.
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:54.100]   $350.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:59.020]   This is a camera with dual, fish-eye lenses on both sides.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.260]   It could take stills or video.
[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:04.260]   Finally is very high resolution.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:07.460]   Although, you'd have to use the stitching program
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.340]   that they offer.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.180]   And although there is an API, I expect
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.380]   we'll see other stitching programs.
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:15.940]   The one I'm really hoping for, it has live HDMI video out.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:18.940]   So if there were a live real-time stitching program,
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:23.780]   we could actually put out live 360 degree immersive videos.
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:24.340]   Let me show you.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.300]   This is an example we took right before.
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:27.980]   This is what you see on the show.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.020]   But if I zoom out, you'll get a little bit
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.740]   of a better idea of what it looks like to be in the studio.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:39.060]   And I can even rotate around and show you everybody.
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.180]   This is one shot.
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.340]   There's our studio audience.
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.580]   Hello, you're famous.
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.580]   This is one blip like that.
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:47.780]   And it stitches it together automatically.
[02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:49.220]   The software does a really good job.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.220]   You don't even see the camera.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:52.980]   It stitches the camera out.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.820]   The camera was sitting on that platform,
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:56.540]   but you don't see it because it's been stitched out.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.860]   What was it like in the Alien Globlio?
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:58.700]   Yeah.
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.780]   This is cool.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:03.140]   And if you have cardboard or you have an Android device
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.980]   and you view this on the Android or cardboard,
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:07.940]   moving your head around or moving the phone around
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.660]   will allow you to easily scroll.
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:12.220]   With a 360 degree video, you could
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:14.540]   post it on YouTube and Facebook.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.340]   After you stitch it, and then they'll
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:20.140]   have controls that let you scroll around.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:22.380]   It's especially, but it's really fun
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:26.340]   to be able to give you this kind of view.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:29.180]   And somebody's asking me how much resolution will tell you
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:29.380]   what?
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:33.820]   Let's zoom in on the chat room here,
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:36.580]   see if we can read.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:39.140]   It's not super high resolution, but look at that.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.220]   I can still read the chat room.
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.140]   Amazing.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:43.380]   So that's pretty good.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:45.940]   That's fairly heavily zoomed in.
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:49.980]   You can see the grain, but it's kind of a dark studio.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:51.580]   So I really like this.
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:52.580]   It's very compact.
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:55.740]   It has a 1/4/20 thread on the bottom
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:56.820]   so you can put it on a tripod.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.900]   I got a special tripod so I can put it there
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:02.580]   because you use the iPhone to control it.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:03.980]   Or I guess you could use an iPad.
[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:05.580]   You could use an Android device.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:07.460]   If you don't, you'll always be taking pictures
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:11.820]   and your hand and your arm will be in every shot.
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:13.300]   But I just put it on stuff.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:14.740]   And that's how I did this.
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:15.460]   I used the remote.
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.980]   In fact, you could see me kind of
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:18.860]   wincing at the-- looking at the remote,
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:19.860]   trying to shoot it.
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:24.340]   But I'm all my way over here shooting the shot.
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:27.140]   If you use your iPhone to take the picture,
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:28.420]   you can really get amazing pictures.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.700]   And as I said, it does video as well.
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:34.500]   There's some examples of that on my blog, leoville.com.
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:37.540]   I shot last week the first 15 minutes of the radio show
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:39.980]   so you can kind of be in there and look around
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:42.460]   as I'm doing the radio show.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:46.140]   It's $350 for a very specialized camera.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:46.900]   It's a lot.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:51.180]   If you're a realtor, if you have some excuse to do this,
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:52.020]   it's worth it.
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:52.740]   It does a good job.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:54.420]   This is the new version of this.
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:58.340]   This is the third, the Ricoh Theta S.
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:03:59.540]   And it's definitely a pic.
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:00.980]   And here's the actual pic.
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:04.340]   And Burke handed this to me before the show began.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.180]   And this is so wild.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.740]   You could buy this on Amazon for about a buck.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:11.060]   It's called the Smart Key Version 2.0.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:13.380]   Let me open it up and I'll show you what it does.
[02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:17.180]   It's kind of a strange item.
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:19.460]   But if you don't use your headphones--
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:22.700]   by the way, somebody's telling me $2.79 on B&H.
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:25.260]   If that's accurate, that becomes a good deal.
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:29.820]   So what it is, is it's a little headphone jack
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:31.700]   that you put in your headphone.
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:33.180]   And it turns it into a button.
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:36.980]   This duplicates the button on the Apple headphones.
[02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:39.540]   So if you don't use a headphone jack a lot,
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:41.460]   but you want a quick stop button,
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:44.740]   as you're listening to, let's say, an audio book,
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:49.300]   you just click that button on the bottom of your phone.
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:53.780]   It adds a stop button to the bottom of your phone.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:56.180]   OK, crazy, but it's only a buck.
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:57.020]   Brilliant.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:59.340]   I think it's kind of a cool idea.
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:01.340]   I'll show you it's pretty easy to take out too.
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:02.340]   It doesn't stick up.
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:04.180]   Let me take the case off so you can see it.
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:05.180]   It doesn't stick up too far.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:08.100]   It has to stick up a little bit or it wouldn't be a button.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.460]   And also, it sticks up just enough so that it's very easy
[02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:12.180]   to just pop it out.
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:12.620]   So that's--
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:14.460]   There's not a Galaxy Note stylus.
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:15.740]   No, it's not a stylus.
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:20.180]   And which camera do you want?
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.700]   You want this camera?
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:24.900]   Oh, could you use it to take a picture?
[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:29.300]   Oh, that would be interesting if it added a camera button.
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:31.060]   But you would just call it volume button.
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:32.820]   You would already have the volume button for that.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:34.620]   Oh, yeah, but this is a dedicated--
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:37.100]   no, it doesn't do it.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:38.540]   Or does it?
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:41.100]   Maybe it just breaks the app.
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.220]   OK, well, there you go.
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.500]   I don't recommend it anymore.
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:46.380]   Does I recommend it in some event team?
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.660]   No, it's kind of cool.
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:49.580]   It did freeze the app.
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:52.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:55.500]   That's great, because usually freezing that up, there's so many--
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.900]   I always wish there was a dedicated button for that.
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.740]   Yeah, if you need a button, it just goes right in there
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:02.340]   and it freezes the app for you.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.060]   Just in case your phone--
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:07.180]   your camera phone app is bothering you.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:09.340]   Everybody get a button.
[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:11.780]   The hell happened?
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:13.500]   It really didn't like whatever that was.
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:16.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.420]   I don't know if I can blame the button for that.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:19.420]   Hold down, let's think.
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:21.220]   What did you do?
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:22.300]   I guess I can get out of it.
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:26.860]   But let's see if that'll relaunch it.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:27.660]   Yeah, good.
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.500]   It's back.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:34.540]   That concludes this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:36.380]   Serenity, it's great to see you.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:41.940]   I saw that you have won the Roller Derby Championship
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:43.220]   and then gave it up.
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:45.420]   You're retiring on a high note.
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.660]   Not retiring.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:50.460]   So we won our local championship, the Boston Championships,
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:50.940]   this year.
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.340]   We've gone 13 and 2 in the last three years.
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.020]   Wow.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.140]   And the last two champs we lost by one point,
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.820]   which this is a game which winning scores
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:03.340]   can be up to 150 to 300 points in the positive.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:06.660]   So losing by 1.2 years in a row, we really wanted it this year
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:07.260]   and we got it.
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.900]   Congratulations.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.660]   But I'm leaving the bus to us and team the skate
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:14.900]   closer to where I look now.
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:15.820]   Oh, OK.
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.860]   So you're going to continue to skate.
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:19.380]   But keep on skating.
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:20.300]   Keep on skating.
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:21.260]   You're going to continue to skate.
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.540]   What's your new team going to be?
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.820]   Do you know or can you say?
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:25.860]   I think he--
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:30.220]   What's going on with her?
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:32.420]   You're breaking up in an unusual way I've never seen
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:33.740]   happen before.
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:34.780]   I don't know.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.660]   I am going to blame--
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:37.420]   Your video is fine.
[02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:38.860]   I'm going to buy a button.
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:39.740]   That's the button.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:41.020]   Did you get one?
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.820]   You got one too.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.140]   Also, she's just getting over cold.
[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.140]   I mean, she's a manager.
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.660]   She was able to hold that in for two hours.
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:48.900]   It may just be my voice.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:49.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.180]   Whatever hotel Andy and I go staying at,
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:53.540]   use their Wi-Fi.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.500]   Rock solid.
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.740]   You look great, my friend.
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:56.980]   Yep.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:59.420]   A window with palm trees also helps.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:00.060]   Yeah.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.660]   That's nice.
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.660]   Thank you for being here.
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:03.820]   Chicago Sun Times.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.460]   Of course, you can read his writing there.
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:12.460]   And the new revived C-W-O-B dot com with lots of short posts.
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:13.940]   Yes.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:16.860]   Well, you no longer need to eat an energy bar
[02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:19.340]   before every single thing that I post there.
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:20.180]   You'll be able to read it.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:21.380]   I'm trying to do the same thing.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:26.100]   I really want to keep more stuff of my own.
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:29.540]   Well, it's part of a nutritious breakfast.
[02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:32.540]   I hope to continue to write for the Sun Times for the next 20
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:35.580]   years because I love doing that.
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:40.380]   It's just that I can't give my editor 200 words in a link.
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:41.380]   And he has to edit it.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.380]   He has to post it.
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:45.260]   And also, I know that there are people
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:48.500]   that are like to consume lots of shorter things.
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:49.620]   So I'm just adding that to the mix.
[02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:52.220]   And also, Jason Snell does it so well.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.780]   Jim Dallerma does it so well.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.460]   John Herbert does it so well.
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:09:01.100]   It's inspired me to do more than what I'm doing right now.
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.060]   Yes, and I am too at LeoVille.com.
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:05.980]   In fact, if you want to read more about the theta,
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:08.580]   the Ricoh Theta S, I posted a little bit longer
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:11.900]   post there with some other video as well.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:15.980]   It's fun to have a little place all your own.
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:16.900]   You know what I mean?
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:19.220]   Well, I've had a blog since like '97, '98.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.180]   No, me too.
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.500]   Since 2000 for me.
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.300]   And you know, it's funny because over the years,
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.500]   I've moved from platform to platform.
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.820]   And each time I move, pieces of it get shredded off.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:33.220]   I mean, I always export and try to bring it with me.
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:36.980]   All the text survives, but most of the images and stuff
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:37.420]   are gone.
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:39.020]   So really, I've learned my lesson
[02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:40.260]   and I've got to kind of-- you know what?
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:42.180]   I don't have a Mac Break Weekly picture in there.
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:44.740]   I've got to work on that.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:47.900]   And thank you, Mr. Renee Ritchie, from iMore.com
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:49.460]   for joining us, as always.
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:52.300]   It's a wonderful thing to have you here.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:52.820]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:56.540]   Everybody must go and read all of the stuff on iMore,
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:59.500]   especially getting a new apple of any kind of thing
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.860]   of any kind because they work so well as a team.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:07.060]   As you heard, no, Serenity's used the tap.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:09.420]   You got to use the manual.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:10.300]   Yep.
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:13.140]   They work so well to create great how-to articles
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:14.100]   at iMore.com.
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:15.260]   Also great podcasts.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:16.820]   Your network is growing.
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:19.500]   Did you see the podcast map?
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:19.980]   I think you did.
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:22.500]   I think you tweeted about it as well.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:25.820]   Did you see the Google podcast terms of conditions, Leo?
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:27.020]   Ah, who cares?
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:27.220]   Why?
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:28.500]   What are they?
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.500]   That they have the right to add post-roll to your video.
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:31.780]   Post-roll, I couldn't care less.
[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:35.740]   I don't think anybody makes it to the end of our shows anyway.
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:37.220]   If they want to put an ad at the end,
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:38.580]   they're, God bless them more power.
[02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:39.820]   Is that true?
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:43.300]   Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.660]   We're testing that theory right now.
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:47.260]   You can say anything you want.
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:49.020]   This is the-- yeah, I saw that.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.980]   But they do say they won't put pre-roll on it,
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:54.020]   and they won't put interstitial stuff.
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.620]   So I don't care if they want to put post-roll.
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:58.780]   So this is the map of the universe.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.540]   Andy is here, too, as you see.
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:03.020]   And then Renee, you've got-- you're
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:04.660]   starting to-- the podcast universe
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:07.140]   starting to expand a lot in here.
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:07.740]   And there's Serenity--
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:10.380]   I like that my name there is Serenity Gladwell.
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:12.980]   Oh, rats.
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:13.980]   Who is that?
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:15.700]   And I'm going to be in comparable network, which is funny.
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:16.900]   Will you get a percentage from Malcolm?
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:17.780]   That's the only question I would add.
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.100]   We'll fix that one.
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:19.900]   That's it.
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:22.300]   And of course, this is wildly incomplete.
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.140]   But I'm just glad that I'm in the center.
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.380]   That's all I need to--
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:28.980]   You would need 300 satellites, Leo.
[02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:30.380]   Hey, thanks, everybody, for being here.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:32.980]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday morning, 11 AM
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:36.500]   Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time, 1900 UTC.
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:37.700]   Yes, that's a new time.
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.180]   Not that UTC's changed.
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:43.100]   We move around because of this silly daylight saving time
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:44.180]   thing.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:45.300]   1900 UTC.
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:46.820]   If you want to be in studio, please do.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:47.500]   We love having you.
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.660]   Tickets at twit.tv.
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:50.900]   Just email us so we can put a chair out for you.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:54.340]   If you can't be in studio, if you can't watch live,
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:56.980]   you can watch whenever you want or listen, whatever you want.
[02:11:56.980 --> 02:12:00.140]   Because we make, of course, on demand, audio and video
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:04.380]   available, not only at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:06.620]   But wherever podcasts are aggregated, including,
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:09.900]   I'm hoping, soon on the Apple TV.
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:10.700]   Thanks for being here.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.460]   We'll see you next time.
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:14.420]   Now get back to work because break time is OMA!
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:17.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:20.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:23.480]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:26.060]   (upbeat music)
