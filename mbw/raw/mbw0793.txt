[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We're going to talk about the Apple lawsuit against the NSO group for state sponsored spyware.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Yeah, you go get them, Apple. It happened the day after Mac Break Weekly last week.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Apple's pointless self-repair program. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And we'll talk about the Apple Project Titan, the self-driving cars.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Lots more details out now, thanks to Mark Griman. All that and a whole lot more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Renee Ritchie is here, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie of eponymous YouTuberReneeRitchie.com fame.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Hello.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Like one of those annoying Hollywood types who writes direct, stars and acts edits,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and just their name over and over and over again in the credits.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I apologize for the...
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   At least you don't refer to yourself in the third person.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   What would the Renee Ritchie think?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's BowDas, Baseball BowDas, Basketball BowDas, Football.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We were watching the 20th anniversary of the Xbox and on Twitter we were watching the famous
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Xbox launch with Bill Gates, The Rock comes out and The Rock refers to himself entirely
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   in the third person.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's always of course.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Now he's King Brahma.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah, right exactly.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Those were all prototyped on Mac computers, on Mac power...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The Xbox.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   They didn't want to talk about it, but if you pulled back the curtain behind the first
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Xbox prototype, you'd see these Macintosh workstations.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And Bungie was a Mac developer.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Andy and Akos also hear I-H-N-A-T-K-O-WGBH Boston.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Hello Andrew.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Renee, you're the Tyler Perry of YouTube.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Renee Ritchie's, Renee Ritchie's presents a Renee Ritchie production of a Renee Ritchie
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   channel.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Renee Ritchie's news on Apple.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So true.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Reminds Renee Ritchie.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Tyler Perry built a block-sized studio in his hometown.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So it could be the Renee Ritchie studios any day now.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   There you go.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   In Montreal's Renee Ritchie Studios.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   In fact, that's what I'm going to call it for now.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   See, this is the problem with YouTube creators.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's like you're trying to one up each other.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Like Linus is getting his own Anoeco Chamber.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Renee is like saying, "I have to have a neutrino positive sealed chamber in which we can do
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   light refraction off of LCD or OLED."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And the man with the robot arm, Alex Lindsey, is also here.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   From onino.media and office hours.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And global.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Good morning, Alex.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.600]   Good morning.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.000]   If we were to open up the studio at some point, would you ever come up here again?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Because you're not far away.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I come at some point.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I definitely go coming up every week would be a lot, but I would definitely come up.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.560]   See, this is the funny thing.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.760]   Now that the pandemic has reached almost two years, it isn't now, "Oh, I can't wait to
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.640]   get back to the way it was."
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.440]   We don't even remember that anymore.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   This is it.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   This is the new normal.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.440]   Well, I think I need to just --
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   Well, he's not office hours, Leo.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   I mean, he can't just pick up and leave, exactly.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.600]   So, we're barely housebroken anymore, because you don't want to sit in your offices.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.080]   This is the new normal.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   Welcome.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.200]   You know, I keep on thinking of going to San Rafael, which is like 20 minutes away, and
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.560]   that's been like two weeks of me going, "Oh, I'm actually going down."
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.440]   You know, I think I need to get down there to look at something, and I just -- it's a
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.960]   little -- it feels like so long away.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   Well, safely away.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.440]   I went all the way to the supermarket like a couple of days ago, and it was like, "Ooh,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.760]   no need to leave the house anymore."
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.120]   You're almost losing down again.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   So, I mean, like, we're all on the verge of like, "Can we actually go out?"
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   Or is this a --
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.760]   I think we're going to hit the two -- I think we're going to fairly hit the two-year mark,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.520]   which is March of next year.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.760]   I have a feeling.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.720]   And I think the other thing, though, is that I've had a couple meetings that I've been
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.960]   brought into in San Francisco, and I've only been to San Francisco like four times in the
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.000]   last two or three years.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.640]   And I -- when I'm sitting there, I'm just like, "Why did we do this?
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   Like, like, why are we doing this around a conference table?"
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.640]   Like, "I could've done this from Zoom."
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.960]   You know, like -- and I look better over Zoom than I look in real life, and I have way
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.000]   more tools, and I can mute myself so I can -- you know, like, all these things are way
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   better.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.400]   So much for my video to get a tell-estrator.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   I got -- yeah, exactly.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.680]   Is that light over your right shoulder?
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.440]   Is that a prop, or is it in part of the green screen?
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.200]   We're working on something.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   So, I --
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   It adds to it.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   There'll be more of that.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.680]   There was a couple of them, but we've been moving them around.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.440]   It's good to have something in the background.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.000]   Well, I'm about to rebuild the studio, so I was going to do it this week, but it'll be
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   next week.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.840]   Right after Mac break, actually, I will tear the whole place apart.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.440]   And so, what I'm doing is putting a more physical set where I can drop the green screen,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.920]   but I can have a physical set.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.000]   And what I noticed was, literally, we were doing tests with these lights, and I was like,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.560]   "You know, the out-of-focus lights look way better."
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   It's good.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.600]   And so, I'm going to -- so, I'm putting a shelving, and I've got a fireplace already
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.000]   here, so I can just use that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   See?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   See?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.640]   We're all coming back to practical effects, baby.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.160]   Yeah, but the lights are because we're -- in office hours, we've been figuring out how
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.440]   to drive the lights, drive my light from a web page on a -- you know, like so when we're
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.560]   using -- so that you can sit there and change the light color.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   We actually had this light flashing with a sound effect, so when the thunder goes off,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   it makes the light flicker to the frequency of the thunder.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.720]   You know, like it actually goes up and down with it.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.160]   And so, once we did that, we were like, "Oh, we could just push this on a slider, and
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   then people can control it."
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.400]   And then we've been looking at literally having, like, you know, our grid inside of
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.280]   office hours, when one person's talking, they get a little brighter, and everyone else gets
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.280]   a little darker.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   You can't do that with DMX.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   You got to do that with software.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   No, we're doing it with DMX software.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   DMX is software.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   DMX is a Dora.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   Streamweaver.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   Streamweaver.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   All right.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.400]   Can you do that thing from the mythic quest where Alex pushes a ball, and it falls through
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   everybody else's Zoom window?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   I love that.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   That was the only good episode I'm going to request.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.600]   I just thought that was great.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   I loved that.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   Renee, that's a great idea.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.400]   I will send you a video when we get it figured out.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.240]   We'll have it just bounce through the...
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   We do that.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.800]   We're working on our Twit Christmas card as one does the week before Christmas, and we
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.280]   decided to make it look like Facebook's meta.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   So we're all...
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   There you go.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   It's going to be interesting, I think.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.480]   You spent a Saturday in Metahuman doing that where we basically try to match ourselves
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.040]   inside of Metahuman, building a character, and it's a little creepy, but it was fun.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   It's exactly what I want.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.800]   In fact, if it weren't creepy, I wouldn't want to do it.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   You wouldn't want to do it.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   Uncanny.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   Uncanny.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.840]   We want to live in Uncanny Valley.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   Yes.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.800]   It's right next to Semi Valley, a little bit away from the Valley.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.520]   So there is Apple.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   There is Apple News.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.600]   Believe it or not, this is usually the slow time as we get ready for this game.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   They didn't wait until after the show.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.240]   They waited till after the show last week to announce that they were going to allow repairs.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.720]   We've talked about it on every other show, but I obviously want to ask you all what you
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   think about it.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.960]   There's really kind of two schools of thought.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.200]   One is, and I think I've fallen this camp right on.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   That's great.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.640]   The other is, no one's ever going to do that.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.480]   In fact, the information called Apple's pointless self-repair program.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.720]   Andy and I co-kick it off.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Sinicism is interesting.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   There's a third point of view, which is that this is just performative theater.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.920]   What is the most minimal way that we can have a sort of a head fake towards?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.480]   We're supporting right to repair so that when we get sued, when we have to testify, when
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   our backs are against the wall, we can tell the EU and Congress and everybody else, oh
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.080]   no, we support it.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.200]   Look, we just voluntarily on our own just out of the blue decided to have this own personal
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.520]   repair program in place at incredible expense and difficulty for ourselves, might I add.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.880]   But yeah, that said, it's better than nothing.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.320]   There are a lot of people for whom a trip to the Apple store is just not in any way practical,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.920]   either because they just can't get out of the house easily or their nearest Apple store,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.280]   even in the United States is three or four hours away, let alone if you live in Australia.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.480]   So it's not nothing and it's not as though it's not going to help some people.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.280]   But the idea that they're saying that we will allow an individual user who gives us
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.240]   the serial number of the actual device they intend to repair permission to repair a specific
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.960]   kind of repair that we will allow you to do if you get the parts directly from us, in
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.800]   which case, yes, under those extremely limited circumstances, we will allow an individual
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.960]   to fix their own devices.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.320]   That's not what right to repair is.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.520]   The whole movement is all about how when a manufacturer like Apple, like John Deere, like
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.000]   any manufacturer has complete control over how a device that is bought and paid for by
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.960]   a user gets repaired, that means that they control basically they're in a position where
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.480]   they can make incredible profits by shipping things that are going to break because if
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.240]   they're a user then has to take it right back to a dealer showroom to have it done by their
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.800]   own service shop, that's bad.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.080]   Also that if they also have the ability to decide that I know that your phone still works
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.120]   great, I know that you're still perfectly happy with the performance of your phone, but we've
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.440]   decided that we're not going to let you repair this phone anymore because we would very much
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.360]   like for you to buy a brand new phone.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.680]   What we're looking for is the idea that if I have an independent repair shop in my community,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.920]   that person can buy the components that they need and we have the freedom to pursue whatever
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.000]   avenue they think is necessary, appropriate and required in conversation with the user
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.400]   to get this thing back up and running.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.320]   Lastly, Apple did have that kind of an outreach a few years ago by saying, "Oh no, we see
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.680]   we're listening and we're responding, we're letting independent repair shops create their
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.760]   relationships directly with Apple and getting components directly from them."
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.040]   Lewis Rosman, who has been waving the flag on this very, very well for a long, long time
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:14.880]   points out that that program was less than useless because number one, these repair shops
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.160]   were still limited to only the types of repairs that Apple was interested in letting them do.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.600]   You couldn't buy a power controller chip even though that was a component that tended to
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.760]   burn out a whole lot.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.480]   Only screens, only batteries, only simple things.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.960]   The repair shops that did sign up for this program had to sign blistering NDAs and blistering
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.640]   limits that would give Apple the power to audit all of their businesses and say, "Oh,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.960]   well, if you're sourcing your own components, doing repairs that we don't want you to do,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.600]   we can effectively shut you down and make you suffer really high consequences."
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.080]   It's possible to both acknowledge that this new program that Apple is doing will help
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.240]   some people and also acknowledging that this is mostly 99% just theater.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.440]   I hope that everybody kind of sees through that.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.760]   I think it's actually probably a little harder-edged in theater.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.280]   I think that not in a good way.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.800]   So anyway, I think that Apple has done a pretty deft move here in the sense that they have
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.560]   largely diffused the right to repair.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.760]   I know that we can talk about whether it really is right to pair or not, but the question
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.440]   is will an average voter understand the difference and I don't think they will?
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.960]   So I think that the chances of getting any kind of heavy legislation in that direction,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.120]   it just makes the hill a lot steeper and a lot slipperier.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   It doesn't mean that you can't climb it.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.680]   It just makes it a lot harder when they're saying, "Well, we are supplying users with
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   those things."
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.360]   So it's just that I don't think people will be able to make that decision.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.160]   It eases their pressure on that area.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.120]   The second thing it does is that you have authorized repair shops that went through all
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.280]   that trouble and then you have all these unauthorized ones that they have to compete with.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.600]   If you make all those components available to everyone, the average person is not going
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.000]   to fix their phone, but I can guarantee that my son is going to build a big business.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.640]   I mean, as this comes out, my son is going to—he's going into high school next year.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.840]   I guarantee he's going to build a little business of him fixing people's phones.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   You know, because he's very technical, he's very good at doing this kind of stuff and
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.440]   he'll learn how to do it and he'll do it.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   And so these unauthorized repair shops are going to have to compete with tons of precocious
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.200]   high schoolers that are going to do it for their friends.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.080]   They're going to do it for, you know, I think the big business, a big part of the business.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.040]   But then turn it into little businesses.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.640]   And so this is what we would usually think of as flushing the market by just creating
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.440]   so much opportunity that you basically spread out the revenue opportunity so that it's
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.820]   not high enough for people to—so for authorized,
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   it doesn't really change anything.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.640]   If anything, it'll make it better.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.480]   For unauthorized, it's going to be a pretty rough environment because they're going to
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.960]   have to compete with a lot more people that can—that will get the training and the tools and the
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.120]   components to do it.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.840]   And again, it won't be the average person.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.320]   No one—no average person is going to fix their phone, but a lot of other folks are
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.760]   going to be empowered to build little businesses out of their home that don't have to pay
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.560]   rent or probably even taxes.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.580]   So anyway, so I think that those are going to be the things that are going to be much
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.980]   more complicated for a lot of the unauthorized dealers.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.180]   I think that this is a pretty rough check into the boards.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.380]   You don't think that's a good thing?
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.580]   I think that it's—I think that it's good for Apple.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.660]   I think that it's—if I was—you know, I don't have a—
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   How about trying to use troll in—
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.660]   Do you think it's a good thing for users?
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   Yeah, I think it's fine for users.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   I mean, I think it doesn't.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.220]   I don't think it's going to—you know, I think that—I would never let any stranger
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.220]   touch my phone.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.040]   So when I look at it for users, I just go, "That's crazy."
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   And so—
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   And so—
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.760]   But you would not do these kinds of repairs like you wouldn't do your own screen repair.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.880]   No, no, because I've done my own—I've done—I've put my own ram into my own laptops and it
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   was never the same.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.400]   Like, no matter what I did, as I took it apart, I put it back together and it was just never
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   quite fit back together.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.320]   So if I was ever going to have someone fix something, I'd have Apple do it.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.720]   Or your son.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   Or my son.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   My son would probably do it better than me, but I've done it—I've had enough experience
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.520]   that I would never try to fix it myself.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.860]   I'll—hold on, Nanny, you've had it your shot.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.860]   You're right.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   You're right.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.060]   Try to keep this to three minutes each.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.740]   Renee, what do you think?
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.980]   Yeah, so I'm not broadly cynical about this move.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.940]   Apple's been planning it for over a year.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.940]   And the way I look at it is you have a lot of people who are very, very fiercely advocate
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.940]   of right to repair.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.940]   And I think that's great.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.340]   I think it doesn't apply to a very wide spectrum of people.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.240]   And I think that Apple also is incredibly controlling.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.640]   And while we look at things like, "They won't let us do this," and that Apple's just looking
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.400]   at, "Oh, how do we build a device that's super easy to do this, that has this battery
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.560]   life that does this?"
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.880]   They're not looking at it from repairing.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.200]   Not out of malfeasance or out of malice, but they're just looking at what is the most
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.080]   economical way for us to service.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.840]   This many devices, and to put this long battery life into it, to cover little galaities of
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.800]   what happens if somebody does have an incident with a lithium-ion battery, they have all
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.540]   sorts of corporate concerns, which are not typically aligned with right to repair concerns.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.140]   And everything is a trade-off, everything is a balance, everything is a compromise.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.340]   And I think Apple is slowly moving out of there.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.640]   We must control everything, mentality.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.840]   And previously, they were using a model where it was just cheaper and easier for them to
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   swap out the device.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.640]   Like, they didn't even repair them at Apple stores, really.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.980]   There were a few things that they did over time, and it went, it changed.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.540]   But you would bring in a phone, they'd give you another phone, and you'd leave, and then
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.660]   they'd send that phone off to a plant to recycle.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   But they can't scale.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.700]   Apple literally can't scale to repair everything.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.360]   And like Andy said, there are whole countries that don't have Apple stores, and they're
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.120]   a mail-in programs, but you can't always mail everything in, and it's not accessible
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   to everybody.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.800]   So I think this is just a small step.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.040]   The thing that I was more interested about last week was they also said that they're
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.400]   not going to be quite so draconian about the deals with authorized resellers.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.040]   If they want to use third-party parts, they just have to make it abundantly clear that
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.000]   they're not official Apple parts, and then Apple's going to have no involvement with that.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.740]   Previously, they were worried that it would be a cause of confusion, or you'd get a poor
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.580]   quality part, thinking it was an Apple part, but they've moved forward on that.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:21.140]   So I don't want to say this in a bad way, but I think a lot of consumers, we've taken
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.140]   the lazy route.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.860]   We've said we want these really thin, really flashy, really sleek devices, and we don't
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.980]   care that they're not that accessible.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.540]   My father used to repair his cars from the ground up.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.780]   It took a look at a Tesla a year ago, just shut the lid and walked away.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.380]   That's increasingly what we're getting, because that's increasingly what we're telling these
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.040]   companies we want, and that is it's dark odds from the people who are more technically
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.760]   inclined and want to be able to get into the guts of it.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.040]   I think eventually you're going to have to make a choice.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.640]   If Apple is a console market, you're buying a console.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.200]   It's buying an Xbox versus buying a PC, and that's one of the things that is worse about
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.920]   the console market is they, you're not just taking apart your modern Xbox or PlayStation,
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.200]   the way you take apart, you were built from scratch PC, and you can't have everything.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.160]   You've got to make a choice, and part of choosing Apple is knowing that they're way
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.560]   more controlling about this.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.720]   That's my very unpopular lukewarm take on the matter.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.520]   I'm a little more bullish on it.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.120]   I should point out for the cynics, there are a few somewhat cynical points to this.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:26.400]   One is that the Apple shareholders lawsuit deadline was that day.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   The lawsuit over right to repair.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.120]   The timing is not accidental in any way.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.880]   That's something to choose a moment.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:39.960]   Also, it's only for iPhone 12 and 13, which are of course the most recent and least likely
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   to need repair or battery replacement.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.600]   They would go to be more easy to repair too.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.600]   Well, and that's a good thing.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.080]   My positive take on this is I hope that it will take the next step.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.240]   By the way, it's going to extend to M1 Max as well at some point.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.680]   Because they'll take the next step and make these more repairable.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.560]   It means nothing if you need a special machine to do it.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.440]   I suspect that's one of the reasons there's a limit to the number or in the kinds of repairs
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.680]   you can do.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   You do have to buy the part from Apple.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.160]   You never change the RAM in a unified memory world.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.480]   There's nothing to repair in the RAM on a MacBook.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.760]   You have to take the whole chip out, I don't know.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   It's an SOC.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.360]   You have a feeling unless you're really good at removing, it's not soldered in.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   It's surface-mounted.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.680]   You're going to have to really replace the whole motherboard anyway.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.480]   I'll be surprised if in five years we're not.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.400]   Every component there is made by Apple.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   It's not going to be something that is a...
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.360]   You do have to buy the part from Apple.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.120]   You do have to right now buy the part from Apple.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:46.760]   You can return your broken or old part for money.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   That subsidizes it a little bit.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.760]   I think it's...
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   I can't...
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.680]   Andy, you said that they could have gone farther.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   I don't think reasonably they could have gone much farther.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:03.880]   I guess the ability to pick and pull parts from old phones for replacements would have
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.120]   been nice.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.640]   That reaction is based on the limits of what Apple is actually saying...
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.360]   The limits of the program that Apple actually put into the announcement last week, when
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.000]   we talk about right to repair, it really is a lot like pornography.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.480]   How does the person listening to you define this thing?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.880]   There could be a very wide range.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.360]   When we're talking about right to repair, at one scale, it really is the extreme of...
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   No, no, no.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   I think that there should be...
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.200]   A phone should be made with no adhesives whatsoever.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.560]   All the chips should be socketed, so you can just pull it out and put things back in.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.400]   You can mix and mix and mix parts, however you want.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.600]   At the other end is that we suppose, as the manufacturer of a device that you spent $1000
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.200]   for, we will allow you to, I don't know, replace a screen or a battery, but other than that.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:05.320]   It's important not to, as Alex sort of alluded to, make sure that when it comes to making
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.920]   a society, making a decision about what rights the purchaser of a piece of a component should
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.560]   be that we don't fall for that sort of fakery of, no, no, no, Apple completely supports
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.120]   this and everything is repairable.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.840]   No, they're just sort of loosened the handcuffs a little bit.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.720]   We want the key to the handcuffs or no handcuffs whatsoever.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.880]   Just one thing, this sort of parenthetical, it is an absolutely legitimate argument that
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.800]   you really can't design...
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.280]   If you want a modern laptop or a modern phone to be modern, you can't insist on 100% right
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.560]   to repair about this because so much of the performance and the durability of this stuff
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   comes down to making it so that only really a very highly skilled robot can put these
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   things together or take it apart.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.200]   That said, once you put these things, there are a lot of really clever engineers out there
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.960]   and a lot of really clever repair people out there that if you tell them that, no, no,
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.360]   there's this component, this charging chip is just a pick and place thing.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.520]   It's only available in units of like 10,000 for the manufacturer.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.080]   It's just impossible for even a skilled repair person to do.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.720]   And then he comes back saying, "No, actually, I won't tell you where my source is, but I
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.640]   have a source for them and they are absolutely 100% valid."
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.880]   And yes, it took me about 30 tries of buying broken phones to practice, but I've got this
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.880]   on lock.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.640]   As a matter of fact, there's a manufacturer in Shenzhen who will give you the solder ball
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.200]   template that you need.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.880]   That's exactly for this component.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.440]   It's just a bump, I think that what we're hoping to, the middle ground that I hope that we can
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.360]   address is the absolute bummer that when you say, "Oh gosh, look, the connector on my
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.480]   phone is broken, doesn't really work anymore."
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.520]   Or, "Oh gosh, look, the letter K key on my laptop doesn't work anymore."
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.480]   It's such a bummer when you take it to a company for repair and they say, "Oh no, we can't replace
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   just that key."
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   He said, "Oh, damn it.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   I'm going to have to buy a whole keyboard."
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.160]   No, you're going to have to buy a whole lower assembly that includes the trackpad, that includes
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.840]   this power rail, that includes these components too, and it's going to cost you $900.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.880]   I'd just much rather try to write without the letter K in the future because if I take
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.280]   this $2000 laptop and do an $800 repair, so there's movement that needs to happen.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.400]   We don't know exactly what movement is going to be satisfactory.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.480]   That is rational for everybody.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   This is a move forward.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.000]   We're happy about that, but just make sure that Apple can't play that card when they're
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.240]   testifying to Congress saying, "Oh, there's no need for any oversight."
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.760]   I know the FTC came up with this really long and intense report in July saying that all
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.800]   of our arguments against right to repair with total baloney and that also our policies are
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.600]   disproportionately affecting people of color and lower income communities.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:51.000]   Pisha, look, we're letting people order a screen and putting in themselves.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.720]   We trust that this disposes of all of your concerns, FTC.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   No more rules, but-
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   I'm not telling anyone else to do this.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Pop the new one on it.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   Of course, quality control, it's actually a shift key, but still, it's almost-
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   It depends what's wrong.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.120]   It was in Swiss, but it worked fine.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.200]   According, MacRumors quotes a study by consumer intelligence research partners that says the
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.320]   most likely repair would be a long shot, would be battery replacement.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.800]   Obviously, that's not going to be necessary on 12 and 13s for a while.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.520]   If that's fairly easy to do, I could see people doing it.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.720]   It's also probably the one that would be the most dangerous, which is that you end up
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   with loaded batteries.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.960]   The thing is, is that the one that's most likely is going to be the one that causes the most
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.800]   trouble because that's what a lot of the batteries that have gone sideways in planes
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.960]   and everything else have.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.840]   It turns out when you start to run down that path, somebody replaced something.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   Oh, really?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   That's-
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   So that's-
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.760]   They don't come out of the factory usually, and that's just a very small little tiny little
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.480]   thing with tiny little connectors.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.320]   If you don't get it just right, it catches things on fire.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   Am I unforgiving?
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.720]   I guess I'm of the optimistic school that says any movement is good.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.880]   Obviously, it's not a 100% movement, but any movement is good.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   It's better.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   It's good.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   The progress is our most important part.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.160]   I think it's definitely a move they should have made.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.200]   This is a strong move by Apple.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.680]   And regardless of motivation, obviously they were pushed into this.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.560]   And they can't handle the repairs.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.080]   There's just no way for Apple as a company.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   They're not even doing this.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.640]   This is being outsourced to a third party, like for a lot of the fulfillment on this.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   Their scale is unimaginable now.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.000]   And I've said before, if Apple wants to be responsible for repairs, they have to just
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.160]   make sure that parts are available at cost for everything everywhere.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.640]   Like if you want the control, you have then the burden of responsibility and they simply
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   can't do that.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.080]   So this is the only alternative.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.680]   And I think they're realizing this along with everybody else.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.360]   And the one thing I didn't see in any of the coverage is how they're going to manage
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   warranty.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.280]   You know, like it's, I didn't see, they didn't say, I don't think they didn't say anything
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   there.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.800]   Then my cynical side is that as soon as you open it, if you're not an authorized dealer,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   you're going to avoid it.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.520]   No, they said it does not avoid it.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.080]   They said it does not avoid the warranty.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.800]   I think they specifically said that.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   Okay.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.640]   But I didn't want to say it's you can't avoid the warranty for that.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   That's right.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.680]   It might be illegal in many, many areas.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.120]   Speaking of illegal, Apple has decided to allow its employees to talk about wages and
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.640]   conditions, which of course, they have to.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.080]   So you know, Apple's really good.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.760]   It's more memorandum than an instruction.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   Yeah, right.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.320]   Don't all go out and do it at once.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.520]   Of course, we will be putting a note in your personnel fire that file that you are the
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.160]   sort of person who speaks out, but don't let that intimidate you.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.080]   To be fair, Apple did have it in their handbook, their employee handbook.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.480]   They said you can't do it.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.800]   The National Labor Relations Board says it's illegal for a company to stop its employees
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.440]   from discussing wages and conditions.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.640]   And Apple says, "We've never stopped anybody.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.200]   In fact, we explicitly allowed you to."
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.520]   But now there's a memo, according to NBC, that says, "You do have the right to discuss
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.680]   pay," just in case there was an...
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.120]   That's why the NLRB is there.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.000]   Not everyone, not every complaint of actually constitutes, "Wow, they must have done something
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   bad."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.440]   The NLRB then has to research it and decide that, "No, there is a case here.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.560]   We will move forward."
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.760]   But that's why the NLRB is necessary, because it's very easy to put that in the employee
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   handbook.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.000]   It's very easy to put that in the video that people have to watch when they're being on
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.280]   board or on the company.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   It's another thing entirely to create an environment where people can speak out without any fear
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.760]   of retribution.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:40.000]   Or just simply say, "Hey, how much are you getting paid?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.480]   How many pay grades did you jump up in the past five years?"
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.560]   People should feel free to discuss those things openly, because it's an open country.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.800]   Are you allowed to want to allege complaints by Sherr Scarlett and others that the company
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.520]   restricted and shut down a pay equity channel in Slack and restricted their ability to discuss
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.880]   pay and working conditions?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.280]   And actually, that was a complaint to the NLRB.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   I'm sorry, Renee went?
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.240]   I was just wondering, is there anything in place to talk people from just lying outrageously
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   about their salary?
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.480]   Is this messed with each other?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   No, that's the wrong thing.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   It's the wrong thing.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   You have to tell the truth.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.280]   And also, there's what you have the right to and what is...
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.280]   You just have to understand that there's an ecosystem that you're inside of.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.120]   And there's a headwind and a tailwind.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.200]   When you start doing those things in any of these large corporations, you're creating
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.200]   a headwind for yourself.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.320]   You have the right to do that.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.480]   But usually, what happens is people start complaining and then they just end up leaving
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.880]   because there's no upward mobility anymore.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.840]   And it's not something that is something that is retribution that happens immediately.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.720]   It's just something that you just created a headwind.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.560]   And so that's always the challenge for employees that companies will say that you can do whatever
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.880]   you want to do.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.920]   But it's not usually really that you can do.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   There's a sleigh headwind too.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   Yes.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.200]   And I think it's going to be a good thing for companies as well because you don't want
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.960]   to have an LRB investigation.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.840]   No, but there's a thousand ways to solve that without anything that is very clear.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.800]   You don't have to have any conversations about it.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   It's just things slow down.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   Right.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   And there's a thousand...
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.240]   I'm just saying that just because they say that it's okay doesn't mean that they think
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   it's okay.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.280]   And as employees that are trying it up, everyone's trying to get to level seven.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.960]   And the problem is, is your manager, when you do it and your bother is your manager and
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.320]   your manager has to pick the next person that's going to get promoted, it's not going
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   to be you.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   Right.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.880]   And it's not something specific and they're not going to have a conversation with you about
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   it.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   They're just not going to do it.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.360]   And so that's the hard part.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.080]   That's the hard thing to put your finger on so they can put these memos out and put it in
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   their manual.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.920]   But it doesn't usually have a lot of teeth.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   We agree that's not right.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.680]   It's a bad situation.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.240]   But that is something that's why oftentimes people who try to organize, try to discuss
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.840]   things like that, they are very brave because they know that it can be a career limiting
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.080]   opportunity.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.600]   But it is something that maybe the next generation of workers are going to benefit from not you
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   yourself.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   But it has to happen.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.000]   One of the things we're talking a lot about labor in society these days, and I'm glad that
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.520]   a generation of workers is saying, just because for the past 60 years we've been a
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:30.400]   lot of employers to get away with this, to say that, no, you will be working unpaid over
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   time.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.920]   Well, yes, I know, but we're in crunch time on this project and we will be working 90
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.960]   hours this week and you don't want it.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.040]   You have to be a team player about this.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.600]   The fact that the previous generation of coders, for instance, put up with this doesn't mean
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.160]   that it was ever right to begin with.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:51.720]   And it doesn't mean that the current generation is wrong to say, no, go get stuck.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.520]   I don't care about this.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.480]   I'm not going to miss out on the first two years of my child's life on a project that
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.920]   I have absolutely no equity stake in.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.920]   And I'm going to be paying.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.760]   I'm going to be my thank you for all this hard work is going to be, hey, here's a t-shirt
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.920]   and a pizza party.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   No.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.320]   So this work is very necessary.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.080]   And as you say, Alex, some people are going to pay the price, but it's a very brave thing
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   for them to do.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.200]   Let's take a little break.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.320]   We'll have more in just a bit.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.440]   Our show today brought to you by AT&T active armor cooking between meetings.

[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.080]   Yeah, of course.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.520]   Work from home is distracting, right?
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.320]   And when you finally get down to work and focus the phone rings and it's a fraudulent
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   call.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.480]   Don't let fraud calls disrupt your flow.

[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.800]   And we thank you, AT&T for supporting Mac break weekly.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:18.640]   Apple has actually taken the step of suing Israel's NSO group to, according to the Apple
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.880]   Press release, curb the abuse of state sponsored spyware.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.360]   They also announced a $10 million contribution to support cyber surveillance researchers and
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360]   advocates.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:36.840]   NSO group has been selling a single zero day no click exploits against the iPhone to governments
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.720]   who want to spy on dissidents, journalists, terrorists.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.000]   It's interesting that Apple has kind of given up on any US sanction against the NSO group
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.480]   and has decided just to just to sue.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.400]   Craig Federighi said quote, "State sponsored actors like the NSO group spell spend millions
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   That needs to change."
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.280]   I think the danger for NSO is of course the discovery.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   So that's what Apple wants.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.720]   So discovery could get really, really ugly for them as they go through subpoenaing information
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.000]   from NSO.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.120]   So the lawsuit I think is probably looking for that because it'll destroy them.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:27.280]   If they actually get what they're asking for in discovery, they don't need to win.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.160]   They'll just crush them because it'll cause the people who have access to it.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   It'll be just devastating.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.200]   It's interesting to see it on Apple.com.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.320]   They put the press release right up and they haven't done that since the HTC patent lawsuit
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.680]   like in 2011.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.520]   Every other lawsuit, even against Corellium, which was probably the most similar in terms
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   of Apple trying to make an infringement case, that was announced off of Apple.com.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.040]   That was picked up by a lot of the wire publications.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.840]   So it's not just like a, they're doing this for a lot of reasons, but one is going to
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.080]   make a lot of noise about they're doing this.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   It signals it.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.360]   I mean, again, a lawsuit with potential discovery signals to everybody touching NSO that we're
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:14.080]   coming after figuring out who you are and we're going to expose it.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.520]   So that's the chilling effect for NSO could be intense.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:24.400]   They specifically in the press release talk about NSO groups forced entry exploit, which
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.320]   did an end around on Apple's blast door, which must have really upset Apple.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:38.840]   It's now patched, but it was used to create a zero click flaw in a subjects iPhone and
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.880]   install the latest version of their Pegasus spyware project.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.480]   This is what Apple says, "The spyware was used to attack a small number of Apple users."
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   It's interesting.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.880]   Apple users, those are our people.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.560]   "Worldwide with dangerous malware and spyware, Apple's lawsuit seeks to ban NSO from further
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.200]   harming individuals by using Apple's products and services.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.000]   It also seeks redress for NSO groups.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.960]   Fragrant, flagrant, might have been fragrant, but I think it's mostly flagrant."
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.440]   Can you smell the exploit?
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.960]   Can you smell the exploit?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   Smell what the Leo is cooking.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.840]   I think when we say fragrant, we mean it in a bad way.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.520]   Flagrant violations of US federal and state law are rising out of its efforts to target
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.720]   and attack Apple and its users.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.480]   In other words, Apple has taken this pretty personally.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   As they should.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:31.360]   Well, it maybe was partly motivated by the fact that the Biden administration put NSO
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.760]   on their government blacklist explicitly saying that this organization is a threat to national
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.720]   security and that no company operating in the United States can have anything to do
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.280]   with this company anymore.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:49.120]   It's a very itchy situation because the company is not like the Israeli government is saying,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.000]   "Well, gosh, it's an Israeli-owned business, and so therefore we have to protect it."
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.320]   It's like, "No, they really do consider it part of its foreign policy.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.520]   They do consider this company's work part of its own national security."
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   And so this instantly escalates into an international diplomacy situation, not just simply company
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.280]   A, trying to deal with company B.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.560]   So, strap in, this could get very, very into it.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.360]   After Biden put them on the list, the Israeli government lobbied hard saying, "NSO group
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.920]   is a big part of our economy.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.520]   We don't, this is a hit on Israel."
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.640]   And of course, that's very politically charged in the US.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   So.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:39.880]   Well, they also have a little bit of control over what the organization does that before
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.240]   they sell their software to another government, there is some interaction with the government.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   It's really a step.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.600]   I don't understand completely, but it's definitely there.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:55.040]   So this is not just, it's not like America getting pressure because Facebook is being
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.200]   a bunch of jerks.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.280]   It's like, "Apple, what do I say, Apple?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   Why do I say Apple?
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   Why do I say America?
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.760]   This is why my brain works when I'm thinking about how many pies I have to cook tomorrow."
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.120]   Anyway, but you know what I'm getting at.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.600]   It's like, it's deeply, deeply entwined with foreign policy, deeply, deeply entwined with,
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.280]   "Okay, well, now who's going to come to defend Israel if we decide as a nation that we're
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.840]   going to try to shut down this organization?"
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.720]   It also makes me wonder if Apple has been at least getting some advice from the Biden
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.920]   administration on how to proceed with this.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.960]   Because if you would think that when the biggest gifts that the industry could give
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.440]   is saying, "We know that the government can't do things to actually try to shut down an
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.800]   independent company that is being sponsored by a government."
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:48.120]   However, a $2 trillion company can sue the hell out of this company, make life really
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.720]   difficult for them in a thousand different ways like Alex suggests.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.800]   Boy, if you ever need like photocopies, well, we got a photocopy you can use, we got a
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.480]   fax machine that we're not using anymore you can have, please, by all means, go for
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.640]   this.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.840]   The fact that they just did this probably reflects the fact that Facebook had done it
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.320]   earlier, it sued NSO Group.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:17.840]   And a trial court had said, "You can't because NSO Group is foreign officials acting in their
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.400]   official capacity."
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:26.880]   That was just overturned on appeal in a three-nothing decision a week ago by the 9th US Circuit Court
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.680]   of Appeals in San Francisco.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.840]   They said Facebook can indeed pursue a lawsuit against NSO Group because they went after
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.560]   WhatsApp too, you may remember.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.600]   So I think that that was a green light for Apple.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.680]   I hope a green light for Google and everybody else to just pile on.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.360]   Let's go get these guys because...
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.080]   Has Google followed suit?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   No pun intended?
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.160]   We shall see.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   We shall see.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.880]   It's been kind of downhill for NSO Group.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.440]   November 3rd, the government blacklists them, November 9th.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.720]   The appeals court says, "Yeah, you can sue them."
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   And now today Apple says, "We're going to do it."
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.040]   It's such a good example of cutting corners that you just don't think are going to come
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   back.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   You get a little loose.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.640]   There's so many places that we can look at like PG&E, not putting power lines under the
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   ground.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   Whatever you thought you were going to save, you end up paying that plus way more because
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.560]   they had something that probably is useful for pushing back on terrorists and crime and
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   everything else.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.080]   What got them in trouble was giving it out to everyone and not having any controls over
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.880]   it and not having any of the other bits and pieces there by being lazy about it and going
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   for more profit.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   Greedy.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.000]   They basically set themselves up for what will probably end up killing the company.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.480]   Let's hope so.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.240]   Not that somebody else won't spring up in its place and do exactly the same thing.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.840]   It's just a lot of money.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   It's just a lot of stuff.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   Different office.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.600]   Andy, what kind of pies are you cooking for Thanksgiving?
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.480]   One is going to be Apple and Strawberry.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:03.840]   The other is, I've probably pumpkin but I have the stuff to make like a scratch chocolate
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   pie.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.200]   So I'm trying to figure out what to do.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.880]   Where are you bringing these fine pies?
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   I'm cooking the entire thing myself.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.000]   I've got a couple of friends coming over.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   It's a friend's giving.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Aww.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.800]   It's a friend's giving.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   It's like a...
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.240]   I'm glad that I had a couple of choices this year.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   Especially after last year.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.320]   But I decided that I would very much like...
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   I would much rather...
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.480]   There's a finite amount of stress that you know you're going to have to deal with if
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.360]   you're going to celebrate Thanksgiving in any way.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.760]   I've decided to spend all of my stress credits on making the meal as opposed to getting
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.680]   dressed, leaving the house on time, making sure that gets a high blood time, making
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   this...
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.520]   Actually, I'm making a turkey.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   I prefer to make the meal.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   Suvi.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.240]   I'm Suvi the turkey too.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.440]   Absolutely the best way to do it.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.200]   How big does your pot have to be to Suvi to turkey?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   I cut it in just a minute.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.360]   I just order a breast as opposed to the whole third.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   So no.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.640]   And you can't get a crispy skin because Suvi doesn't do crispy skin.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.720]   But what I do is I just simply remove the skin and pan fry it.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.960]   So every plate gets like these beautifully just crisp fried skin chips.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   That's the...
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   Anyway, that's actually...
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.360]   We've been to Thanksgiving for you last month and it was fine.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.280]   So you don't have to worry at all.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.440]   That's kenji-alt Lopez's Suvi's solution to turkey.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.080]   I didn't think that...
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.480]   We did it last year because I forgot what I was going to do for the turkey.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.880]   And I was like, "Well, I have all these Suvi's.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   Let's Suvi do..."
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.840]   And then we'll do go here.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.400]   My family liked it so much when my parents are coming up.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   They have been up for two years.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.480]   My parents are long.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   My wife's parents.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   Wonderful.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:44.000]   And so I figured my wife's mother is from Louisiana and just makes incredible Thanksgiving.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.880]   So I thought I was no longer making the turkey.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.240]   My wife was like, "No, you're making the Suvi turkey like it is.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.880]   It's really good."
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.040]   And so I was like, "Okay."
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.440]   So I felt like I had...
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.840]   Me getting chosen over her mom making it is...
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   Wow.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   But she's making everything else.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   But she's making everything else.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.840]   She's making all the sides which...
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   The Lucy and I thought the eating...
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   I thought the eating really want.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.600]   Like literally today I'm starting the beginning of the fast.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.400]   Tomorrow they'll be full fast.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.600]   And then because I got to set up all this room because it's good as leftovers but it's
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.720]   incredible, you know, the day of the event.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.840]   So I will be starving by the end of Thursday.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.800]   So for our international listeners Thursday is the day we call Thanksgiving.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   The turkey day.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   The United States or turkey day.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.760]   And we have always avoided the turkey.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.720]   We're doing a ham again.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   We do both.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   That's works.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   So it's not a fish.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   Honeybait.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   I'm doing a fish.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   No fish.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.280]   I'm doing a Traeger smoked ham.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.080]   Low and slow.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.200]   And we got a nice kurabata ham from Snake River Farms.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.360]   I'm going to take it a lorry kill again.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.440]   She's the one who got me into the Traeger world.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.600]   She sold a million Traeger's.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   I bet.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   Yeah, she has.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.960]   Did you do anything for Canadian Thanksgiving or anything?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   We had the moose.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   We had the maple syrup.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   We had a family thing.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   We had a last year obviously.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.520]   We covered from the giant maple syrup theft.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.200]   I just think that's the hilarious.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   No, but I don't know if I told a story before but the seven million dollars of maple.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.480]   The two top stories were the maple syrup theft and a guy getting drunk and riding a
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.520]   moose and I thought it had to be staged.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.720]   There's just no way that.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.760]   They stole seven million dollars.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   That was years ago.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.280]   I just keep thinking about it.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.480]   I just keep thinking about the fact that this stole seven million dollars.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   The four million dollars.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   The above.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   So much stickiness.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.080]   One other cultural question though, Renee.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.600]   What about that story from last year where there was a hurricane, NHL hurricane's game
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.360]   and the emergency goalie had to play like a whole period and a half in a playoff like
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.640]   a consequential game.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.600]   I understand that that also was like one of the top stories of the entire year.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.040]   He was a guy off the street.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   Right.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   He was appointed.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.320]   I love this NHL rule.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.000]   The team has a regular goalie.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.160]   They have a backup goalie.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.560]   But the facility I understand is also required by the NHL to have a back.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.120]   A emergency goalie on call.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.960]   That is just basically you're just sitting in the press box and just enjoying your time.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.920]   The primary goalie got taken out by injury.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.280]   The backup goalie got taken.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.120]   And at that point the announcement to comes to the press by saying, yeah, George, I'm
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   sued up.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.760]   And then he actually has to be here.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.440]   He's actually put in the game as a neutral goalie, but still playing for that team and
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   was not like just.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.440]   Oh, yeah, Tony.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   One of the gold.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.280]   Yeah, as I say, does it with the Zimoni driver, please report to the goal is the Zimoni driver.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.280]   Incredible thing.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.440]   Of course, he's got his own helmet from home.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   This poor guy.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   He was so bad for him.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.560]   He played minor league hockey like 15 years ago.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.160]   But he made it all to one level and that was about it.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.560]   And then that shot, they had to like sew his name on the back of it.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.400]   The team travels with an emergency jersey.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.000]   So they had to quickly get his name on the back of that jersey.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.080]   And my god, he had like sort of like eight was an eight shots on goal and like six saves
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.080]   on the base.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.480]   And he did he did and the story of like all the other members of this team who don't know
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.320]   this person are like, this is great.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.200]   You're going to have a good time and joy every moment of this will take good care of you.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.440]   And man, he absolutely delivered.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.680]   And so anyway, I just I just came across the story.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.640]   Sam's the old.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   He didn't even have a gun.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.280]   He just stood there and told me only only in Canada.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.000]   Yeah, it was that masked man.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.160]   But David, there's a bag of goalie.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.000]   His moment in this in the sun.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   That's great.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   That's really great.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I just love that role where it's like, what are we going to do?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.760]   Well, we will provide you with a goalie.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.080]   I can't believe that every every arena has somebody who can do that.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   Let's use another right to him.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   It's like a doctor on fuel.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   Look at that.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Look at that.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   It's like a race.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.520]   Saving it, getting it out of there.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.120]   Every game, every game, there's somebody who has like some sort of semi pro or high amateur
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.560]   experience who gets a free ticket to the game.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:09.040]   He brings his mask and his pads without any idea that it's any like any other sport that
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   does that.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   You know, I like have a backup field goal.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.040]   Well, you don't have goalies in a lot.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.520]   Like the American American sports.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.680]   Well, we do see so many people go to soccer with their own gloves just in case.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   Hey, we need an outfielder.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.440]   Yeah, just in case I can run in.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.960]   Can we borrow some kids' glove?
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   Right.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   Crazy.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   Tim Hortons.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   Look at the save.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   Look at the save.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   They're all, you know what they're doing?
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   They're backing them up.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:41.080]   They all got in the, they got in the crease there to save them.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.800]   He's got the upstairs for Charlotte backup.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.760]   And what a story he has just for eternity.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.200]   It's like, did I ever tell you about when I played professional hockey?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   We're not kids.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   Come here.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   And it's a good story.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.080]   It's like you're just you're visiting the sky.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.280]   You know from work that, you know, you work at the lumber yard or whatever.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.000]   And then like, oh, we'll want to come home over play Xbox, whatever.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.520]   It's like, Hey, wow, is that a game game old journeys to Jersey that you bought?
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   Wow, good piece of merit.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.760]   Oh, yeah, that was from the time that I, that one game that I played in professional hockey
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   and NHL, right?
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.960]   And I just say that, right.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.680]   Can I just say that like, I love that Andy is on NPR, but really we deserve way more.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.600]   In Canada, we have these people who just sit and talk on the radio for like Sunday mornings
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.760]   and they share stories from throughout the country.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.920]   Andy should be that for America.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.520]   You should be the Canadian radio host for America that just shares the best stories every week
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.320]   for a good two, three hours.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.760]   What's, what's the American version of Canadian tire?
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.280]   Because we need to get that sponsorship.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.560]   American tire used to be radio check.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:45.600]   Apple is paying a big fine along with Amazon for colluding in Italy.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:52.280]   Italian antitrust authorities have fined them a total of 200 million euros.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.480]   Amazon will pay 68.7 million euros.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:05.600]   Apple, 135 point, 134.5 million euros because of a 2018 agreement between the companies that
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:11.960]   met only selected resellers were allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon.it
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.000]   that violation of EU's competition rules.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Okay.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.040]   Also in the news, also, also in the news, Apple and Amazon dug through the mats in their car,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   found loose change.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.240]   And sent it to them like a huge amount of money.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   Here's some dirty quarters.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   I can't mix a billion a day.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.000]   So actually, I think it is the case in the US as well.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.520]   I mean, there are not a lot of people selling Apple stuff on Amazon.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   They seem to feel great.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.120]   So they had a problem with fake parts.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.200]   Like there was a huge problem with people selling fake parts as genuine Apple parts,
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   really scamming people.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   Excuse me.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.880]   And there was a ton of protests and a ton of consumer complaints.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   And the way that Apple and Amazon solved it was to say that you have to be able to prove
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.680]   that you have Amazon, you have genuine Apple parts.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.720]   But unfortunately, that requires a certain volume of sales to be able to get genuine
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.560]   Apple parts. And I'm not saying people should be able to like self-fake Apple parts by any
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.520]   stretch of the imagination, but just that everything has repercussions.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.360]   It's one of those trade-offs that we talked about earlier, where them trying to stop people
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.160]   selling fraudulent parts, now upset people who were selling very low volume, genuine
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.640]   parts but couldn't prove that they were genuine because they didn't have maybe all the receipts.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:26.480]   So now it's actually a weakness in Amazon's setup that we found, we were experimenting
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:31.120]   in office hours, that we all jumped on this thing where it said a stream deck was going
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.960]   to be really, really inexpensive, half the price it normally should be.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.640]   And we had a sense that it might be fraudulent, but we ordered it anyway, just to see what
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   would happen.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.560]   And so the bunch of us ordered it.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.160]   And of course, what you get into is this never, never land in Amazon.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.320]   They say they created a shipping label, but they never sent it out.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   And I'm still waiting for it.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   I've had the experience.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.640]   And now you can't, Amazon doesn't have a tool that lets you dig into that.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.600]   And if you file a complaint, if you get too rough about it, Amazon says you can't order
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   anything from Amazon anymore.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.840]   They just cut it out as a consumer.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.640]   And so the thing is, is that you just kind of track it, but the result is A, them trying
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.800]   to control some of this.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.680]   And people like me now, I won't order from a small business anymore.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   If I don't see it sent, I want to see it sold by Amazon coming from an Amazon warehouse,
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.080]   and I never looked at that before.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.760]   But now I look at it all the time, like small person, I won't, I won't order it because
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   I got the truth.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.200]   I have stuff on Amazon as third party sellers.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   And it's all sorts of issues with that.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   This is where you look.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.880]   So I'm here's a 2021 Apple MacBook Pro.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.960]   And this is not sold by Apple, but it's sold from ships from Amazon sold by Amazon.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   But I also clicked on one that looked this like kind of the same listing, but it was sold
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.960]   by a refurbisher.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.280]   It's mostly like power cables and things.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   So that are much harder.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   And parts are more tricky.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.600]   Like a $3 power plug on cable or something.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.760]   The other thing that's tricky is that you'll click right under it.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.600]   If you click on that, go ahead and click on one of those.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.160]   It'll say visit the Apple store.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.000]   So you have some sense like, no, right under the maintenance.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.800]   Oh, that looks like the Apple doing it.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.680]   Well, then you think, oh, this is the Apple store.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:11.360]   But what you have to look at is underneath the order area, selling that to you.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.280]   And this one's at a Rama.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.600]   And by the way, if I refresh this, it might be somebody else.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.960]   That's the funny thing is different people.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.440]   What if I have the listing?
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:27.480]   But I have to admit that after that stream deck experience, if I don't see a real vendor
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.800]   there that I know that I've heard of before, I don't buy it anymore.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   Right.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.680]   No, I'm the same way for everything, for everything.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   Because there's just so many.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.440]   And the problem is that's unfortunate for the third party resellers.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:45.760]   And it's because Amazon's mechanisms for managing fraud are very rough.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.360]   They just don't work very well.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.800]   And so the only way you can manage it is not take any chances.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.760]   Yeah, by the way, Adorama, no problem with that.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   No problem with Adorama.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.240]   But you have to know that you have to kind of...
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   Exactly.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.000]   Like we know that Adorama is a reasonable company.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.320]   We'll be in H or not be in H, but Adorama.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   Not being H?
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   You don't like being H?
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.320]   No, no, no.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.320]   I order tons of stuff.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   Yeah, I too.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:13.120]   You know, I basically, for me, if I'm ordering AV equipment, I order it from DVE store first,
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.360]   if I can do it because the service is really, really good.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.960]   And so I'll order all my AV equipment from DVE store.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.360]   And then I, if I can't find it there, I usually wander over to...
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   Being H or Sweetwater.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.360]   Being H or Sweetwater.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.960]   I order audio gear from Sweetwater because Robert Williams is my representative when I...
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.680]   And then I get emails from them all the time.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.360]   I know exactly what's happening all the time.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.760]   They put a little candy in the box.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   The candy is really good.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   The Tootsie Roll.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   You get the Tootsie Roll.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   The Tootsie Roll.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.920]   And then there's a...
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.600]   How often do you get a honey...
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.160]   The one of the little honey...
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.160]   The honey fingers?
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.160]   Yeah, a bit of honey.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.160]   Yeah, a little bit of honey.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.560]   The only time I get a bit of honey.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.560]   Sweetwater, baby.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   Sweetwater.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   But here's what an Apple MacBook Pro sees.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.360]   It says "Renude" from somebody called "Mote Warehouse."
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.240]   See, they may be fine.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.680]   And I guess you can look at their ratings and everything.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.560]   But you don't know about the ratings either.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.560]   I mean, it's...
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.960]   And the ratings aren't like 99.9.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.360]   Like I know that in eBay, if I don't see 99.999, like I'm not...
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   Not gonna order anything.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.560]   Florida that was kind of a mistake.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.360]   But that's another story for another day.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.360]   Florida toilet is like Florida man.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   I know it's...
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   You know what?
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.360]   You have something Alex though.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.360]   I have to say that my...
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:29.720]   What really gets my attention, I think there's actually an XKCD cartoon about this, that
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:35.440]   if I see a product with a huge amount of reviews and the rating is like 4 out of 5 stars,
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.360]   I think, "Okay, these are genuine reviews."
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.640]   If I take the time to read them, I will see what people actually think about this.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:50.360]   When you see the 5 star review and 300 reviews, I'm like, "Okay, who paid what phone bank?"
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   Well, here's the...
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.560]   I can try not to do this.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   Here's the crazy one.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.920]   I bought a bike and I put a bad review up.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.640]   I said the seat isn't very comfortable.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.040]   You know, I like it as a stationary bike.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.360]   And I said, "See, they ping me."
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.240]   And they said that they would pay me to take that review down.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.640]   I said, "I'm not gonna take it down."
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.440]   Like, that's what it was.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.240]   Like, I said, "You can send me a new bike and maybe I'll think about it."
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.960]   But outside of that, I'm not gonna take it down for some money.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.760]   I'm not gonna do that.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.720]   But then after that, I stopped paying attention to that.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:24.480]   I mean, I really have to see good reviews and detailed reviews or I don't believe them.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:31.000]   The speaking of reviews, Costa Eleftherio, who is of course the slighted developer of
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   Flick type and now is like, "I got it in for you, Apple."
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   So he's become the...
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   The Dark Knight App Store detective.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   He's the App Store detective.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   From Apple's heart, I stop asking the question.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.000]   "You know, you could probably write a whole new app and make more money than sitting here
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.160]   like just deciding to dig it on the phone."
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   How much time does he have to put it on his phone?
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.840]   And you know, he's doing us a favor.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:54.440]   How did Apple Podcasts, he asks in this tweet from a couple of days ago, suddenly go from
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.480]   1.8 to 5.6 stars.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:06.000]   Well, it turns out Apple interrupts your podcast and says, "Leave us a review."
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:13.600]   And so they've been very actively campaigning to get the reviews up without, in fact, fixing
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   any problems.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.240]   I think it's worse than that, though.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   People are assuming that they're being asked to rate the podcast, which they're enjoying.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   But it's actually...
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   And it's not Apple's not lying about it.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.680]   It's just the thing pops up.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.640]   Like a lot of apps do is like, "We have a rating."
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.360]   And I think people are mistakenly thinking it's a rating for the podcast.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.520]   I mean, all apps like Caris Wisher right now.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.200]   All apps make decisions about when to do it.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.080]   And if you watch when they actually do it, almost all apps are asking you to rate.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.560]   Like you win a game and the game will say, "How's the game going?"
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.720]   Like literally it'll say, like, after you won, like, and you did well, it will immediately
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.680]   ask you, "How do you like this app?"
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.760]   And so they're making all...
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:56.080]   Anybody who's smart who's doing development is going to find the best possible time to
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.360]   ask you whether you like it or not.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:06.920]   Well, and cost of provides as proof of this, the actual reviews of these improved ratings.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:11.960]   And they are to a great degree for shows, not for the app.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   These are great shows.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.840]   Great to have you in the out, like, keep it going.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.480]   Jeff is a great teacher.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   Great podcast.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.640]   Your insight is very positive and informative.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.120]   So folks, if you get a pop-up while you're listening to our show, I know you love it.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.080]   And I know you love the five stars, but don't do it then.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.440]   It's reviewing the podcast app.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.480]   It's also hard to know that you're a podcast too, which makes it worse because it was
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.200]   all obvious how to review a podcast.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.440]   But you have to tell people, like, scroll all the way to the bottom, press this thing,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.280]   dance around in a circle, do the makarena, and then it'll pop up, it's magical.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   It's always...
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.680]   Actually, I will add that it weirds me out when, like, outlook.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:54.040]   Microsoft, the number two, and oftentimes the number one most valuable tech company,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:59.720]   the entire company, the entire planet, like, you don't need me to give your app a positive
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   review.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.840]   No, very few people are using outlook voluntarily because they're shopping for the best of an
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.840]   male client.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   I mean, it works great.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   I love it.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.360]   But it's not as though, like, why are you bothering me at all by asking me, "Hey, are you
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.360]   enjoying outlook?
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.920]   Please give us a positive review."
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.520]   You like to see that kind of hustle with somebody who's just like two or three people,
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.160]   like, working out of their kitchen, working on an app that they really believe in.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.000]   And you're really motivated to help those people out so other people can find out.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.360]   Exactly how good this thing is.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:30.480]   But I'm like, "I'm giving you money every month for access to your email outlook.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.240]   Don't put this on me.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.320]   This is starting to become a weird relationship, dude.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   I mean, I'm not...
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   I'm gonna have to back up a little bit."
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.120]   It's funny because a bunch of corporate apps, like, it's the same thing like if anyone
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.560]   who works at YouTube puts up a video, it gets just bombed.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.440]   And if anybody in a big company puts up an app, people use it to air their grievances
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:50.000]   against the company, not always specifically the app, but they'll go into the review thing
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.600]   and say, like, the head of YouTube put up a video the other day on a charitable clause
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.400]   and people are like, "Why did you get rid of our like button?
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.400]   I hate this.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.120]   I just want to dislike it, but you got rid of it."
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.280]   Or Apple is up and up.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.440]   Why did you change the way this button works?
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.440]   Or Microsoft puts up a thing and says, "You destroyed this..."
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.800]   There's just so many things that people complain about.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.920]   And I figure they look over and they go, "Hey, it's working for these other apps.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.040]   If we ask people to smash the like button on our app, maybe it'll work for us too.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.760]   Hey, can you leave a review lemureating?"
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.560]   I'm not going to get rid of some of the negative.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:24.080]   Does Apple crack down a little bit on what apps could do, though, to ask reviews?
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.840]   You can turn it off and they have to honor your turn off.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.160]   Because previously, at any time, there's a few different tensions here.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.080]   When you put up a new update for an app, it overwrites the ratings.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.040]   So if you had a bug fix, you had a bunch of really good ratings, you had a bug fix,
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.720]   all that looks like it's gone and then people tried to incentivize you to leave a new rate.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.760]   It was just a bunch of unfortunate circumstances led people.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.680]   And then, of course, there's always people who abuse the system.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.240]   And to Alex's previous point, some of them were saying, "Do you like the app?
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.600]   Yes, you go to the rating.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   No."
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.800]   "Okay, well, here's how we can help you."
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.600]   You wouldn't even be prompted to rate it at that.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.440]   There was a whole bunch of mind games going on.
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:02.200]   So they put in a bunch of levers to get people to say, "Please leave me alone at this point."
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.080]   To me, it's a dark pattern.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:12.600]   And it's unfortunate because it always seems to pop up these things at the worst possible
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.720]   time.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:21.080]   And also, they start by saying, "Do you like this app?"
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.600]   And if you say, "I like it," then you have to do all this other crap.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.320]   But I don't want to say, "I don't like the app."
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.080]   It's just really, it's a dark pattern.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   Stop it.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   Just stop it.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   I was having that problem with it.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.200]   It's one of the reasons why I kind of stopped using my tile tracker because there was a
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.760]   point at which I think I uninstalled it because it got so annoying and never got around to
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.520]   reinstalling it because it was doing this stupid thing where it was, whenever it would
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.960]   give me alerts and you seem to have left your bag behind.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.640]   And it was like, "Well, actually, no, I didn't.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   I just...
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   This is not relevant.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   I'm just going across the street to pick something up."
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.040]   And was this relevant to you?
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.200]   And I'm saying, "Well, maybe if I say no, it wasn't, it will say, "Okay, I'll try to
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   do better."
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.360]   But then it just...
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.360]   It turns my phone into something that is not a phone and starts turning into a feedback
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.280]   mechanism specifically for a no...
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   Great.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   Drop whatever you're doing.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.680]   And here's the survey that now I can't back out...
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.800]   I can back out of, but I have to stop my walk, hopefully not in the middle of the street,
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.000]   but I have to disengage my mind from wherever it was and engage it into getting this app
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.080]   to stop doing things.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   It's all these...
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.640]   But it's part of that class of interruptions that we're talking about where I don't...
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.000]   It's not in my interests to start giving your app good reviews.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.440]   So stop asking me.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   This is rude.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.040]   This is not a real relationship, I think.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   There's another bad one that happened where Apple allows developers to ask for email addresses
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.160]   now, so a bunch of apps updated to that.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.680]   And I noticed when I was restoring my iPhone that I couldn't restore my purchases.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   Like you're supposed to be able to opt out, I kept pressing cancel, the app would crash,
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.920]   I would press cancel, it would work, but then the restore features didn't work anymore.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.080]   The minute I gave it a fake email address, everything restored beautifully.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   And it's just...
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080]   It's like...
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   Maybe...
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.480]   It's like there's these apps that I love, like a bunch of people make great plugins for
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.080]   Final Cut Pro, but now every single app wants to run their own little menu tray thing that
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.440]   has a download assistant and installer, but that also conveniently shows ads all the time.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.840]   And you can't dismiss it while it's installing things.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.920]   And now my menu bar is littered with all these little installer apps and I blame Adobe for
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.360]   starting that, but it's just...
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.000]   I just want to pay you money and use your product and you keep getting in the way of that.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   100%.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Perfect.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.280]   This is our relationship.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.640]   You have something I want.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.200]   I will give you money for that thing.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   And then you will...
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.760]   I will have the thing I want and you will have money.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.080]   Our relationship is now concluded to hopefully the happiness of both people.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.080]   Don't try to be grabbing.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.360]   I want to try to get more out of me than what...
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.200]   That's exactly what happened to Tile.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.880]   Along comes Life360.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.720]   They say here, have...
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   What was it?
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720]   $20 million?
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.160]   No, I'm sorry, $205 million.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160]   And thank you very much.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.680]   And now Tile is owned by Life360.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.440]   Italian Fine Worth of Money.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.040]   And now they have all of the tracking info that you've been giving Tile for all of you.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   Lovely.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]   Life360.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.320]   And I think we've talked about this before on the show is a family safety platform.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:19.520]   There were the ones that were using Apple, among others, that were using Apple's MDM
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520]   and Apple...
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.520]   Didn't Apple...
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520]   Renee, do you remember this?
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   Didn't they kick them off?
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.960]   Yeah, they denied them API access.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.760]   They got all angry saying that Apple had them an optly over parental guidance and Apple
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.640]   decided to make a separate API that they could use that wouldn't give them the complete
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.200]   control and ability to dominate your device as the way that MDM API does.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   Right.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.040]   And I'm kind of not a fan of apps that let family members kind of track their kids.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.040]   Although the GPS tracking part of the kind of location tracking, I don't mind so much
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.560]   because kids sometimes get lost.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:57.200]   But there have been some privacy concerns about Life360.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:06.480]   Tile is going to keep its CEO, CJ Prober, the woman who testified against Apple in Congress,
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.440]   just in case you're keeping score.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.640]   When the acquisition is completed, it will be able to leverage Life360's 33 million, 33
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.480]   million smartphone users, which will grow Tile's finding network by 10x Tile, of course,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   facing a lot of competition from air tags.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.320]   In fact, Christina Warren said we should stop calling it "surelocking."
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   We should call it "air tagging."
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   It is though.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.080]   I will say that I have a bunch of tiles and a bunch of air tags, and I actually like the
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.080]   tiles better.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.080]   Like the air tags are really, they're really chatty.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.080]   You know, like the-
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080]   It's very chatty.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.000]   They say things like, you just, you know, you just left your keys at home.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Is that okay?
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.640]   Well, left your car in the parking lot.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.000]   I don't want to say that you left your friend's AirPod Pro maxes at his house.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   I was like, yeah, that's-
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   Yeah, that's-
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Because they're his.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   They're the one I knew of to the phone.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.560]   It was very upset that I had walked away from those headphones.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   And the-
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   That's a little weird.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   I have to say.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560]   Those are great.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560]   Those phones are great.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560]   You know?
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.800]   But the thing is, is that the air tags, I mean, when they work, you're just like, wow,
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   this is amazing.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   You know, it tells you where to go.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.160]   But half the time in my house, it's like, you're too far away.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.040]   I'm like, okay, I'm in the house.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.240]   How hard is it to tell me?
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.320]   The NWB does it work unless you're approximate.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.960]   And the problem is that it also, the tiles are a lot louder.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:30.040]   So the air tags are so soft that I feel like I have to be almost standing on them to hear
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   it.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.000]   I think maybe are we soured on the whole idea of a Bluetooth tracker in general?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   There's so many problems.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Oh, no.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   No.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   The interesting of tile just implemented apples thing on the iOS side.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   They would have had the best of both worlds.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.200]   They would have had a version that also ran off of apples devices and then also Android
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.280]   support, which Apple was never going to offer.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.920]   And they could have had to fill that one product to roll them all, but they went a different
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   path.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   They were angry.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.480]   They that actually tarnished their judgment.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.480]   I'm of the opinion of Judo.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   They should have jujitsued apple.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.480]   Yes, right.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.680]   I will say as someone who's a forgetful, forgetful professor, I use my air tag or my tile.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680]   That's a lot.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.840]   Probably at least once a week.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.360]   Maybe maybe a couple times a week that I'm looking at because part of it is I don't bother
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.360]   to try.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.360]   I don't even try to look for my keys.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.360]   I'm like, where are my keys?
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.360]   Oh, I'll just turn on.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360]   It's actually the same thing.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   Like I just, I don't, I don't think about it.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.920]   I think by the virtue of having the air tag on my keys, I don't lose them anymore.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   It's like something.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.200]   For me, for me, the thing is the virtue of having them because now it's, it's kind of
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.800]   like, I, I can't remember any calendar events because I have a calendar.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   I have an eye.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   Or you can't drive it over because you have a chain.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   Yes.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.200]   My brain has stopped trying to pay attention to where my keys are.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   Yes.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.800]   Because like I, I have a way to solve that really quickly and you don't need to manage
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   that anymore.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.920]   Clear it out.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.160]   It's excess brain stuff.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:54.760]   I really do think that the, we, we like the idea of trackers, but they're way too vague.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.960]   The way they're implemented right now to work really well.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.320]   I think, I think that what could really change the game though is if the software were more
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.960]   like a machine learning model where it figures out your habits of like, okay, well, I'm not
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.720]   going to warn, I'm not going to warn Andy that he's, that he is no, he's not carrying
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.920]   his laptop bag because I've learned from experience that he doesn't often carry it like on a
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.880]   Tuesday in the afternoon.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.160]   So that I'm just simply going to do a quieter alert or unless he's told me within the app
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.320]   that by the way, don't try to be smart about this.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.680]   Tell me whenever I'm separated from this thing.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.080]   So it's, it's not that it doesn't work.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.160]   It's just that even Apple, uh, implementation, it's a very, it's apparently a very, very
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.360]   difficult thing to make it work the way that a user expects it to.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.600]   Well, especially without invading their privacy or appearing to.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.200]   And I think that's a lot of it.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.400]   And I blame you privacy advocates.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.640]   If you would just relax and let these companies have every bit of information.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   They want just that.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.880]   We would get all these things.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   Determining negative intent is really, really hard for any system.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.680]   It's like, um, in, there's a bunch of different examples, like when does Andy want to leave
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.040]   his luggage at home?
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.880]   Like that's, that's a hard question to answer.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.280]   When does someone want to stop using it?
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.240]   We can, I message we can either add, are you sure you want to leave, you should leave your
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   luggage at home today?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.560]   You sure you want to leave your luggage at home today?
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.480]   That gets super annoying, but then he leaves his luggage at home.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.280]   He's like, ah, why didn't you tell me like, well, you didn't care the last seven times.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   I understand.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.760]   And it may, so I said, I'm, I'm kind of thinking it's just a structural problem with Bluetooth
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   trackers.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.640]   It's just off, but, but, but, but even that could be very, very simple.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.400]   Like if there were just an app setting that says that there was a really, really big difference
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   between I left my house without something and oh, he's been carrying this thing with
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.440]   him all day and now he doesn't have it with him.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.000]   Maybe he left the bag behind like at his, at the library or whatever.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.280]   So it's just, just a little stuff.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.680]   If you were willing to be a little less private, for instance, it could scan, look for airplane
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.440]   tickets and know you need your bags today.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.960]   So in order for this to work well, it needs to know more about you, but we've really decided
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.280]   we don't want that to happen.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.000]   Well, but, but I think Apple is probably ahead of that because we get really weirded out
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.600]   of Google knows that or Amazon knows that, but Apple, because of their privacy, I mean,
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.640]   that's, that's our assumption is that they have a, they're going down, they're definitely
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.400]   going down that path of, of we want to make an assistant that isn't working yet very well
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   right now.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   But, you know, a series becoming a lot less ditzy than she was before.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.600]   I mean, I, I ask her a lot of questions all the time and I'm surprised at how many she
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   answers correctly.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.440]   It is a worthy pursuit to say, how can we do this and preserve privacy?
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.440]   We'll do more stuff on Google.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   On the phone.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   I mean, Google's going on device too.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   Google's got the TPU chip in here for that very reason.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   So that they get asked your Gmail app instead of scanning your Gmail repository.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.440]   People will be freaked out as much.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.440]   Right.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440]   Well, I think it's just asking for missions.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   But, I know.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440]   Go ahead.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   That looks.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.120]   I want to ask a follow up on one of your observations because you said something that really triggered
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.320]   something that I went through.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:51.840]   So, I was having a problem where I made my first like day trip into Boston.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.200]   Somebody used to do every single week to go to the studio for NPR and for first time
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   there.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.640]   And so the first, when the first time that I was taking commuter rail again and so I've
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.920]   got my iPad Pro and suddenly I'm getting this like little, this modern looking dialogue
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.040]   that says, "Hey, brand new AirPods Pro.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   And you took a screenshot of it.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.280]   Explicitly saying, "Hey, here's some AirPods Pro that don't belong to you.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.800]   Would you like to pair them?"
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.800]   And there wasn't like an explicit like X in the square to, "No, please don't bother
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   me about this."
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.720]   And it kept popping up and popping up until it finally gave up, which I thought was extremely
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.000]   weird that it was now obviously someone else's AirPods Pro within the train.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   But wouldn't it?
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   It's weird that--
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.040]   It's a hard part is that they can't quite get it right because the other problem I have
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.800]   is I've got a bunch of phones and iPads and everything else.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   I have a phone call with the phone that I'm using and I can't get my AirPods to talk
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.600]   to that phone.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:55.680]   And I've tried to unshare that my AirPods with the other devices that I have, but it
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.840]   wants it to be all my account or not my account.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.040]   So Apple trying to make it easy has made it impossible.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040]   It's gotten better.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   It's been a long time.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.440]   It was like, "I don't know whether I'm going to actually be able to talk on the phone."
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.080]   It's way too promiscuous.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.800]   And so it's-- and what it was doing, I realized it was constantly jumping to some other phone
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.800]   or iPad that I might have had around.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.280]   Because I've got lots of test phones.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   I'm not new to test phones.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.560]   But if there's a stream of audio, it should never interrupt that.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.760]   We're on the Zoom sometimes and my phone will beep and it'll disconnect my AirPods from
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   an ongoing Zoom just because my phone beep.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   And that's just bad logic.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.320]   So I think it's like, "I'm holding the phone."
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   The accelerometer has to know that I'm moving it.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.080]   In fact, I'm shaking it because I'm trying to get it to just-- like, you've got to know
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.360]   that I'm here trying to have-- there's got to be a behavior.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.840]   That's okay to say, "You're just mad with it.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   You're shaking it.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   That's fine."
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.760]   There's got to be a behavior of, "Oh, he's got a phone call that he's turned on and he's
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.240]   got the AirPod in his ear and he's shaking the phone rigorously."
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.040]   That should probably mean that I should connect these two.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Like, that would be great.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   Isn't that intelligence with you amazing?
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.000]   It's like, "Ince, can I have you an answer today to be announced a behavior based on shaking
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   an anger?
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Now, Instagram does something?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   I forgot what it is."
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.520]   Well, Apple for a while was the bug report thing, right?
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520]   It was just shaking the phone.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.520]   Yes, no, no, no.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520]   I'll tell you.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   When I had an early on with the iPhone where like, "Oh, this is great.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.920]   I'm going to put this in a car mount so I can use the maps."
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.720]   And it was screwing up, screwing up, screwing up.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.160]   I was trying to figure out why.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.400]   And it wasn't until I really thought it through and my calm down at home was like, "Oh, it
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.000]   has the shake to undo feature."
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.960]   So every time I hit a bump, it would think that I was trying to undo this map request.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:35.080]   But it really just really does show how so good it's shake to get help is a new Instagram
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   feature that just launched.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.440]   And it's like shake your phone because you're upset or angry.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.920]   It's not offered to help you.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   Throw it just to be sure.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.160]   Sometimes it doesn't engage.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.000]   Well, let's take a little break.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.760]   There is actually a lot more to talk about.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   And just a bit.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.920]   Renee Richie is here from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.880]   WGBH in Boston's Andy Inako is joining us.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.480]   Free pie and whatever else he's batch-cocking.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.520]   And then Alex Lindsey, who will be making the turkey later from 090 Media and Office Hours
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.520]   dot Global.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.400]   Our show today, we should really have a Thanksgiving episode.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.960]   We never work on Thanksgiving, but it'd be kind of--
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   Thankful for you every day though.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   Just kind of--
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.200]   Maybe we'll see you tomorrow dinner.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.400]   John, you're coming to the dinner, right?
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.400]   Yeah, Burke's coming.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.880]   You know, we do a cooking thing every Saturday.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.480]   So I have a whole rig in a box.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   Like I can literally--
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   Come over.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.840]   Within 20 minutes, I can set up-- I can set up the whole kitchen.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.080]   I can set up my whole kitchen in like 20 minutes.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.840]   I wonder how many Zoom thanksgivings they're going to be this year.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.200]   I mean, everybody's kind of, but a little more equipped to do that.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.120]   We have a couple people that are doing open houses where they're just leaving a Zoom window
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.560]   open at the end of their table so that their friends can stop buying and say hi.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.560]   And, yeah.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.000]   From now on, you won't leave a chair for Elijah at Saters.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   You'll just leave a Zoom open for Elijah.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   Who's--
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   You can chair for H.264.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.120]   I show today brought to you by userway.org.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.240]   I have to say this is as much a public service announcement as it is an advertisement.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.240]   Userway's amazing.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:12.080]   I really completely connect with their vision, which is to make every website in the world
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.240]   accessible.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.920]   And frankly, it's the law.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.480]   The Americans with Disabilities Act requires it.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.480]   But also because it's just the right thing to do.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.200]   They're 60 million Americans with disabilities.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.080]   You don't want to leave them behind on your website.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.560]   That's business you're turning away.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.920]   Userway is an incredible AI-powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.040]   web accessibility guidelines, WCAG guidelines set by the worldwide web consortium.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.320]   With just one line of JavaScript, userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.720]   And I understand because we have websites.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.880]   I'm always, oh, man, I'm going to have to make this accessible.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.720]   That's overwhelming.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.520]   But boy, userway makes it easy, simple, cost effective.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:05.960]   You can see right now if your website's accessible, just go to userway.org/twit and check out their
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.760]   free scanning tool.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.240]   You can see if you're ADA compliant.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.120]   Userway is used by some of the biggest companies in the world over 1 million websites, including
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.320]   Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, many other leading brands.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.400]   They've got the message, you need to be accessible.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.480]   And now I love it because userway is making its best in class enterprise level accessibility
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.600]   tools available to small and medium businesses.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.560]   Millions of people will require userway just to purchase your products.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.120]   And of course, userway will scale.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.560]   I mean, if they can handle Disney and Coca-Cola, they can scale for you.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.880]   You need userway.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.000]   Userway's AI automatically fixes violations at the code level.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.680]   They actually help you build an accessibility layer for every browser visiting you with
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.200]   things like image alts.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.320]   It uses the AI to automatically recognize the photo and generate the alt.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.000]   It writes the image descriptions for you.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.520]   One of the biggest things stumbling blocks for screen readers is complex nav menus.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.640]   It remediates those.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.040]   It ensures all the pop-ups are accessible.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.520]   The forms are accessible.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.360]   Your shopping cart is accessible.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.800]   You want your shopping cart to be accessible, right?
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.920]   It fixes vague link violations, fixes broken links.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.960]   Make sure your website offers accessible colors while remaining true to your brand.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.440]   And you'll get a report with all the violations that were fixed on your website.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.760]   And it makes it very easy for you to work with userway to enhance them if you want to
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.000]   enhance those all tags, for instance.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   Completely platform agnostic.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   It works everywhere.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.600]   WordPress Shopify Wix, easy to add userway.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.560]   Same for AEM, site core, SharePoint, even the hand-coded site.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.680]   It's just a one line of JavaScript.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.520]   Userway integrates seamlessly with every kind of website.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.720]   And it will let your business meet its compliance goals and most importantly improve the experience
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.800]   for your users.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.120]   Just ask Susan Bennett the Voice of Siri.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.280]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original Voice of Siri.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.120]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.360]   I don't understand what you're looking for.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:16.440]   But every day, that's what the internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.

[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.880]   Well, if Apple won't come to Google, maybe Google will come to Apple a little bit, they're
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.920]   going to add emojis for iMessage reactions.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.480]   It used to say, you know, in text, somebody said a thumbs up.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.160]   Now they'll actually put that thumbs up in there.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.920]   It's starting to roll out already.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.480]   Look for a place to update to your Android.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:46.680]   If you use Google's Android messages, instead of liked an image, there'll be a thumbs up,
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   things like that.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.680]   So that's good.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.680]   I really still wish Apple would support RCS.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.760]   And then the world would join together in happy Thanksgiving.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   Oh, God.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.320]   Another topic that we'll be arguing about at Thanksgiving table.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.320]   What?
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.320]   I keep telling you guys.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.320]   Blow bubbles.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.520]   You're a blow bubble.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.280]   We need to switch to signal.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   Who knows what happens when the party.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.280]   Oh, I wish.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.280]   If I could get my family to switch to signal, I would be very...
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   Is there anything?
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.360]   What is your family user, Renee?
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.200]   I message every single person I know with almost no...
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:31.240]   I don't think I've gotten a green bubble text in because you are subconsciously avoiding
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   Android users.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.240]   No, not at all.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.000]   Because of their green bubbles.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.360]   I know you are.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   You're discriminating.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.680]   No, so actually what it is is that most of the people that I know who use Android devices,
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.760]   they ping me on Slack or Discord.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.240]   It's just like that's become...
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   They know.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   Because that's where our community goes.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.240]   They know.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.240]   Right.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.240]   They say, "Okay, all right.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.240]   I know I can't.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.240]   I'm..."
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.240]   Everyone...
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.640]   It's my friends and family who are I message, but anyone I work with or like...
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.680]   Everybody else doesn't use any SMS stuff anymore.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.160]   They only use Discord or Slack.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.200]   Many of my family uses an iPhone except my daughter who's an Android user.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.880]   And it's just not...
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   So I have to...
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   It's just frustrating.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.800]   It's just rebellious.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   It would be really nice.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.440]   You know, it would really be nice if Apple offered iMessages for Android.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.280]   Then I could use this Pixel 6 as my...
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.800]   It's the only reason the Pixel 6 is not my main phone right now.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   But you raised a good point.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:31.000]   I've never heard an explanation for Apple why they are not excited about RCS.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.880]   If you have a carrier-based standard that they don't have to support, it's been defined
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.880]   by somebody else.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.720]   It will allow more accessibility for other people.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.360]   I'm sure there's a possibility that there is some technical reason why it doesn't integrate
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.000]   well with iMessage or if it's just not a project that they can allocate resources to right
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   now.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.040]   But when there seems to be a standard that acts as a better glue between different mobile
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.920]   devices, I think a company like Apple needs to explain why they're not supporting it.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.280]   I think that one of the things is that in general when you start, standards make it easier
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   for everyone to work together.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.840]   There's a lot of them that are useful.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.720]   They also limit what you end up doing.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.880]   So I think that if you see that as an area, almost every company as they look at the world
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.520]   in front of them, look at you either control what makes money and you commoditize what
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.000]   doesn't make money.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.600]   So there's a lot of companies that want to commoditize things because they want to
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.200]   commoditize messages because that's not what they...
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.760]   But Apple wants to innovate inside of iMessages and starting to add other standards is just
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.640]   another cycle that they have to deal with and things that they might not be able to do
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.360]   because it won't work over there or they have to figure out what the error message is when
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.720]   they do the thing that they want to do.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.040]   And I think that messages is definitely an area of innovation for Apple.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.400]   And so I think that their resistance to it has less to do with anything holding on.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.400]   I mean, I think it did at some point.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.280]   But Alex, they support SMS.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.280]   They have to.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.920]   Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to text somebody on an Android device.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.080]   RCs is SMS 2.0.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080]   Think of it that way.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.080]   Why...
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.640]   They could easily support it in the same way they support SMS.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.400]   If you're talking to somebody with an iPhone, you're going to use messages.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   But if you're talking to somebody who's not, I don't know why they wouldn't replace SMS
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.400]   with RCS.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.280]   My guess is that they're just waiting.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.040]   They're going to support it when a critical mass hits.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.000]   Like right now, SMS is still...
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.920]   SMS is like 2G Edge.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.360]   It just hasn't gone away.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.120]   And RCS is like 3G and they'll have to support it and they'll do it eventually.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.000]   Another thing is they're a funny company.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.080]   They didn't support MMS on the original iPhone, not out of Malice, but because they were so
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.520]   proud that they made the Safari browser a real web browser for a phone for the first
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.840]   time, they didn't even think about like WAP technology at all.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.520]   And it turns out that WAP is what was used to render MMS.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:38.160]   So they just technically didn't build anything and they found out like at the last minute
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.560]   all week because they wouldn't tell ATD what they were building either that they just couldn't
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560]   support this stuff.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.160]   And there's like so much technical debt built into all this.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.880]   So my guess is like they've got a skunk works project working on this and that at some point
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.560]   when it's what you have to use on the carriers.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.760]   They'll just announce support for it.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.240]   And we just have to remember that rolling anything out to hundreds of millions of phones cost
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.440]   millions and millions of dollars.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.240]   Like it's not this isn't like, oh, why don't we have a programmer work on this and then
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.760]   it'll just work.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.160]   It's it's going to it's it's it's it's it's allocating large number, you know, a group
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]   of programmers.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.760]   It is all the all the QA and everything else.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.280]   You want me to give Apple a good reason to spend that money?
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.160]   Because you know who it's going to stick it to?
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.760]   What's app and Facebook Messenger?
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.160]   I don't think so.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160]   Absolutely.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.160]   I don't I don't know.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.760]   Those are so I mean, what's app is so big?
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.080]   And I mean, it's it's hard for me to deal with anybody overseas if they're not on WhatsApp.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.480]   I mean, if I'm not on WhatsApp, which I'm constantly breaking for some reason on my
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.480]   phones.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.480]   And so I don't.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:34.480]   Yeah, we chat.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.480]   Yeah, we chat.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.880]   I mean, those are so big that I don't think that they would be affected much at all.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.720]   But you know, not even just what I'm doing.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.600]   No, that's the problem.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600]   That's the whole point.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.560]   The RCS is fully ended and encrypted.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:52.160]   Yeah, it's I just feel if there's I feels though there's enough benefits to users right
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.240]   now that Apple should say, okay, let's let let's get on this.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.560]   Alex raises an excellent point without even mentioning that it's not just it's also the
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.240]   problem of integration with the existing code base.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.320]   There's also the problem of validation.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.800]   It really is a big deal.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.360]   But this is where I hit like command shift eight on my mental macro board, which is to
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.160]   say Apple is a two trillion dollar company.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.480]   They can allocate those resource.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.560]   They have the Alice resource less than they're paying Italy.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.960]   You know, but again, we if we look at if we look at the number of jobs, I mean, right
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.400]   now you can't simultaneously say the Italy fine is meaningless.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.320]   I can't spend on our.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320]   It's not it's not money.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320]   It's people.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.000]   So the thing is is that Italy is just money.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   That's not a big deal.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   Right.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.120]   It is it is the allocation, you know, the people that are required that have the technical
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.400]   knowledge that are already built into this that are doing those things is they don't
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.000]   grow on trees.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.200]   And it really is a reason wording SMS right now, but it's higher.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.200]   Okay.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.880]   But it's it's it's, you know, it is do they do they fit into the entire culture?
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   Do they do?
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.200]   You don't just hire random people into into companies like this.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.120]   And so so the thing is is that it is it is it's naive to think that that someone can
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.600]   just go out and build a team that's now going to integrate with something that's important
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   within the company.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.040]   And they're just going to be able to source that up because it's not that's just not
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   how it works.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.960]   So it's not, you know, these companies, it takes a lot of time to get those resources
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   in place.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.640]   It takes a long it's a it's a big process to put people into a company like this because
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.400]   what they're going to be looking for is do they fit into the overall team?
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.560]   Will they fit into the overall culture?
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   Yeah, but Apple does not all it's.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.440]   And they add new features all the time.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   Exactly.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.960]   And it is one of the importantly, the case that SMS is not a safe and usable protocol.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.120]   And there is a replacement.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.760]   It's supported now by carriers.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   Right.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   You should all I'm saying is it.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.160]   I mean, I just until until someone requires them to do it by law, there's no way they're
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.200]   going to allocate scary scares.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.440]   All I'm saying is not saying that Apple can't do what it needs to do.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.360]   Apple can do whatever it wants to do.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.480]   But what I'm saying is that it is not a trivial problem.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.400]   It is a it is a significant expenditure of time and energy for them to allocate those
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.600]   resources.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.040]   And right now they don't have a critical mass as as Renee said, they don't have a critical
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.000]   mass of people asking for it.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   Like Apple users don't care.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.680]   Like, you know, like like 99% of them 99.99999% don't care about whether they support RCS
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.680]   or not.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.920]   So that's not that that's not usually where a company like Apple puts energy is into an
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.000]   edge case because this is really an edge case.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.160]   Like no one know I've never heard of an Apple other than on this show, I have never heard
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.080]   of RCS like literally never heard of it.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.080]   Privacy is an edge case.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.080]   If you're going to limit what Apple does to what what the users are demanding, that's
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.880]   a really narrow list.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.760]   But they're not going to tell us like internationally very messy still like the adoption rate outside
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.560]   the US and the US was 2019 and mostly Google driven and internationally you've got some
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.560]   carriers on it.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.800]   But the carriers just supporting universal profile.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:55.400]   And I'm guessing that that this is very recent and is going to coagulate a little bit more
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.400]   before they roll out something.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400]   So settle down and unified.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.960]   So only one iOS intern.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.640]   Yeah, it's also only one iOS code based internationally.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.240]   They don't have different versions for different geographies.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.320]   So they probably want to support whatever hits critical carrier mass internationally.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320]   Right.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.200]   59 countries as of the end of last year.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.400]   Less than 88 carriers, which sounds like a lot, but it's not a lot compared to the
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.320]   300 plus that they support.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:23.320]   Yeah, I'll say and I can wind up my thoughts in just one sentence that it's it's absolutely
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.800]   perfectly fine to acknowledge that Apple does things that they want to do.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.520]   They try not to do things that they aren't motivated to do.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.720]   And that when this things like this pop up, it's in conflict with Apple statement that
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.160]   we think that privacy and security are sacrosanct and human rights.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.600]   And then when you say, wow, great.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.400]   So you're going to be supporting this open standard that would make the default messaging
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:50.800]   platform on your for non iPhones on your on your iPhone much more secure and much more
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   stable.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.720]   We don't believe in it that much.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.880]   I mean, it's private ish.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.600]   That's enough, isn't it?
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:08.240]   Anyway, if you're waiting for your driver's license to be stored in your wallet, you're
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.640]   going to wait a little bit longer.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.040]   It was supposed to come out this year and iOS 15 features now to late until early 2022.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.960]   I think by the time we get it in California, we'll never get.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   I won't be driving.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.160]   Yeah, I won't be trying to get it.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.920]   Arizona and Georgia, according to Apple, would be among the first states, Connecticut,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.600]   Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:35.720]   It is apparently in discussions with more US states, according to Mac rumors, including
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.960]   Florida as it works to offer the featured nation nationwide.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.120]   It's a big deal because yes, we could get both.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.000]   You have to do the states have to do a lot to support it.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   You can't you know, you're you have to have a way of verifying it so that I don't just
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.360]   show you a pick to you know, this is so good for the state.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:59.280]   The highway, like this is so good for the states.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.280]   I think it's going to save money.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.360]   Like they're well, not it's not just that they save money.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.400]   Your phone is way more secure than a little piece of plastic in your wallet.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.840]   They would love to get to a point.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.760]   States would love to get to a point where you don't get to use that plastic anymore.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:18.560]   That won't happen anytime soon, but but this is this is a something that they've wanted
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.960]   to do for a long time and I don't necessarily super excited about it myself.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:27.000]   Yeah, because you actually have to give your face ID information to the state.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.320]   This is this is a gold mine like it's just just a gold mine, you know, for for states.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.800]   So so of you know, of being able to lock this down a lot tighter.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.960]   Now I can't think of a lot of legal reasons to worry about it.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.440]   And I'm a pretty boring person.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.640]   So I think it's probably fine for me, but I think that, you know, it starts to really
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.480]   set up a question of how much we're handing as far as digital media back to the government.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   Digital like mail Alex, which means that your your concerns about identity are probably
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   really bad.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   Exactly.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.800]   So, yeah, so so I know that I don't have any, you know, I'm a boring person that doesn't
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.200]   go out very much.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.200]   So I'm probably fine, but I can I can definitely see that this could be utilized in bad ways,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:10.680]   but but I so I think that I'm a little paranoid about it, but but I think that this is definitely
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.680]   in the state.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.480]   I mean, I can see why the states are willing to the states that are doing it are willing
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:21.200]   to jump in is because they're because this would close a pretty big loop for them, especially
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:28.880]   around like, you know, immigration, you know, is piece of this that I do wish that I know
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.560]   that the state ID this is this is done at the state levels, just like elections are regulated
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560]   on the state level.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:40.040]   This isn't something that the federal government can create standards for, but I wish that the
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.880]   federal government would hurry up and create guidelines and recommendations.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.080]   If they did, I think in early this year, I want to say April or May, they responded
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:55.160]   to Department of Homeland Security request that we want to we want to have such a set
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.560]   of guidelines so that we can at least say here are the recommendations we're making for
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.040]   every state if they want to do digital driver's licenses.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   And I think right.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   I don't think it's moved.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   I think they're working on it, but it hasn't been developed yet.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.040]   But I'm not going to think this is going to be a real thing until instead of relying
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.960]   on a company like Apple, thinking that this is something that we want to do and therefore
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:18.120]   we're going to staff up and do it and implementing it.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.280]   However, that they decide is going to work best and be supported by governments, a state
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.240]   government at a level that they think is going to work.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:30.280]   We do need some sort of a federal guideline that says that here is the minimum requirements
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.960]   to make sure this is secure.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:38.840]   This is protecting people from outside people and also from our own governments, hopefully,
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.560]   but also making a working thing that will be available to everybody, not just people who
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.280]   have a really super expensive phone.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:50.360]   And that's when the real ID extension is really going to make this happen.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.840]   I think that's when we're going to see Google really come on board with us when we're going
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:56.240]   to see Samsung and everybody else really come on board.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.800]   We do need that kind of guidance at this point.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.960]   It's interesting that Apple is pushing this, but they don't like this is turning me around
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:07.480]   on the previous conversation because you know, if Apple drives technology sometimes, they
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.080]   come out with things that the industry isn't ready for, that there's no standards around
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.080]   and they're just through sheer force of will, push them through.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.200]   And I think Google's kind of hoping that Apple does that with RCS as well.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.360]   Like if they can do it with ID cards, you know, because it's a better, more private,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.480]   more secure solution, they can do that with RCS.
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.720]   They can do that with a bunch of standards.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.720]   They just got to pick their, pick the ones that have the highest likelihood of improving.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.640]   I don't think it's, I think it's also that they, that they, that Apple has a specific
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:37.440]   use for it, like Google wants to have Waymo because every, every minute that you're sitting
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.560]   behind a car, you're not searching Google.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.720]   You know, so there's a reason for a Google to want car, you know, driverless cars.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:48.000]   Apple on the other hand, you know, as an Apple user, I think that it's a common thing that
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.520]   I keep on looking at my phone going, why doesn't it open my door?
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.000]   Why do I have to have anything in a wallet other than my phone?
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.180]   Like that is, I think where Apple's trying to get to is that I have a phone and that
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:32:59.720]   phone has all the things I want.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.960]   It opens the door to my car.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:01.960]   It opens the door to my house.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   It opens the door.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.680]   You know, it has my IDs and my credit cards and, you know, all the things that I need
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.560]   are all in this one little thing.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:13.080]   And so Apple, of course, is going to raise heaven and earth to make it easier for a user
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.160]   to, to have that experience.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:19.120]   RCS just doesn't, doesn't, well, fit into that model.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.720]   This is, I think, I think, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll make sure you have my direct number
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.240]   because I think, I think you have it because we met up a few times before, but, but yeah,
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.840]   but this is, this is also really every time we, we have a discussion of any company on
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.520]   something that would be good for the users.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.760]   It's so, so much of the calculus is always about, yes, and how does this pay off for
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:37.760]   the company?
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.800]   With Apple, yes, it would make it very much easier for a lot of people, but it would also
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:46.880]   be yet another, you're adding the bar, you're adding another six inches to the limbo, to
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.240]   the, to the bar.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.000]   People have to clear and say, yeah, but, you know, if I switch from Apple to an, to, to
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.360]   an Android phone, I'm going to have to like redo all of my, all of my IDs, my portfolio
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.680]   whereas if I just walk into the Apple store, I'll walk out with a new phone with a better
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.360]   camera, more memory and a, and a pink, and a pink plastic case, I won't have to do anything.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:08.920]   So it always, with Apple, it always comes into hardware lock and how can we make sure
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.640]   that whatever the next phone, our iPhone, iPhone, it turns out it's going to be another
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.800]   iPhone.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.200]   It turns out the insanely great experience is really addicting.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.160]   You know, so like, I mean, it all does work is really, really hard to give up, you know,
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.040]   and it's, and so I, I, I agree with you.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040]   You know what?
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.240]   Actually, the, the number one thing that keeps me in the Apple ecosystem now is the, is
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:32.600]   the M1 silicon because it just really isn't anything.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.680]   I think the Pixel 6 competes very well against the iPhone.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.880]   The Samsung watch that I've paired to my Pixel 6 competes very well with the Apple watch,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.400]   but there's nothing like the M1.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.400]   It turns out.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.400]   It turns out.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   Are you going with this?
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.400]   Are you going to the Microsoft story?
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.400]   I think we're going to the Microsoft story.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.400]   Yes.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400]   I think we are.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.120]   Turns out windows on arm has been crap.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.920]   Microsoft develops it, but it turns out now that that's because Microsoft has had a secret
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.520]   exclusivity deal with Qualcomm, a deal which may be expiring.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:13.280]   This comes from XDA developers, so I'm going to give them the credit.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.400]   And this is why, by the way, you couldn't run windows on your M1 Mac because you couldn't
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.400]   be wouldn't license it.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.480]   They wouldn't license it.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:23.760]   You know, you can get windows on arm, but it's in beta because it was their deal with
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   Qualcomm.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.360]   So they would make it bad?
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.280]   No, the that has to be on a Qualcomm processor windows.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.000]   Is it weird because Qualcomm was the only other as like the Qualcomm was the only SOC nobody
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   foresaw app.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.680]   I mean, people foresaw it, but there was no nothing in the market.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.760]   So why would you have an exclusivity deal with the only person making the chip?
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.000]   They just have a deal with them.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.200]   The exclusivity part you don't need to.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.800]   Well, I think they want a Qualcomm to put some money and work into it probably.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.600]   It was a part of the deal.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.000]   Now, I'll be curious.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.200]   One thing that this is Rich was writing on XDA developers.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.640]   One thing I wasn't able to learn is when the deal will expire only that it's the thing
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.160]   holding back other chip vendors from competing in the space.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:09.400]   Samsung's just announced they're going to build a $17 billion chip plant in the US.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:15.240]   I have a feeling, you know, Samsung, which makes arm chips, Apple and many others would
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:17.400]   probably be very interested.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.640]   Those on arm should be better, but it's been running on laggardly poorly designed Qualcomm
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:23.640]   chips.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.600]   They claim that next year they're going to have a desktop quality chip.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.600]   We'll see.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.920]   They say we're going actually wasn't next year.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.640]   What was it Renee that they're going to go after M1 three years off to your top?
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.160]   Because of course, M1 isn't going to change at all.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.720]   I'm sure they'll get to M1 speeds and efficiency in three years.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   And that'll be fine.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.760]   I'm telling you that's how Apple's hooked me because I can't.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.880]   I just there's no competition for what they're doing.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.920]   Now we don't normally do a lot of rumors, but there's there's more and more rumors about
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.800]   an M2 for next year.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.680]   And I think we're definitely going to see.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.280]   I think a Mac, I'm a pro, which should be a pretty amazing machine.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.040]   Really a really isn't too much of a rumor though, because M1 even M1 Max and M1 pro
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.680]   are based off of the A14 and it's already in A15 out there.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.960]   And so we know what the cores are.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:13.840]   We know what Avalanche and Blizzard and G14 are.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.760]   There's a lot of known things about M2 to be really excited about.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.680]   I just love the idea.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:27.080]   Now the latest rumors that next generation iMac Pro will have two chips in it.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.360]   So we'll have what is 40 cores with two guys.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.840]   You know, I mean, of course, that makes sense.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.760]   That's how you double the you get to 64 gigs of RAM or 128 gigs of RAM and you know, on
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.200]   all of that.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.760]   These things are monsters.
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.680]   It's unbelievable what we're getting.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.840]   I'm so I'm so excited about the desktop Mac that I'm definitely going to be buying next
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]   year.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.840]   I am so excited about it.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.920]   And and no one as Apple continues to ramp up and get better and better, it's just leaving
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920]   everybody in the dust.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.960]   Well, and the thing is from a performance perspective, go ahead, go ahead.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.760]   Alex versus then Renee.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.960]   All I was going to say is they're hockey sticking when they should be leveling.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   They're hockey stick.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.520]   Like from the from the from the company size, you would expect a leveling off and what they're
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.880]   doing right now is suddenly arcing and that that is terrifying, you know, for everyone
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:17.520]   around them because they have the scale to make all the deals that they want to do that
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.880]   you don't usually when you're doing that kind of growth, you usually don't have scale.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.880]   Right.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.480]   Renee, what were you going to say?
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.480]   Well, I was going to add well, two things.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.680]   One is that it was really interesting watching the Qualcomm summit because they also were forced
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.120]   to kind of admit that Apple modems will be a real thing within two years and they still
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.880]   have a licensing deal with Apple, but that's going to be built into the SOCs for like the
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.960]   VM for the a 17 or something.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:43.080]   But the interesting thing is that Apple Apple managed to avoid the two biggest drawbacks
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.160]   of becoming a silicon maker.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.280]   And most of those were because the silicon makers were separate.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   They weren't integrated.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   They were modular.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.640]   They were merchant silicon brokers.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.000]   And that incentivizes you to keep a chip on the shelf for a long time because you recoup
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.800]   way more development costs.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.640]   The longer that chip is viable, but now they have to update every year the way Apple
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.640]   is updating.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.880]   But also they have all these different clients like a Qualcomm SOC that runs Windows is going
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.880]   to be different.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.680]   The one that runs Chrome OS is going to be different than one that runs Android OS and
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.200]   they can't specifically target for any device.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.080]   So they're forced to have extra baggage.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.480]   Just not being like, one of the things about Apple chips is every transistor is being used
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:22.960]   by every device that's using it to different levels, but they're all in there.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.760]   And that's not true for a lot of other silicon vendors.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:31.240]   So Apple's managed to do the scalable architecture where you have an A13 core in the Apple Watch,
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.880]   and you have these A14 cores and M1 and M1 Max.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:37.000]   And then you have multiple versions of those cores.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.800]   And now we're going to get multiple dies of the multiple cores in those versions, but
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.400]   it's all the same bionic architecture.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.160]   And that is just so much more efficient, like not even processor efficient, but just
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.600]   company resource allocation and development efficient that it's really not anything that
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.520]   Intel or Qualcomm or anybody has ever done before.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.520]   It's remarkable.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   And I think the other other issues I think that we are going to continue to see this
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:07.120]   kind of merger between the M1 iOS worlds where any Apple run on the iPhone, the iPad and
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.240]   the M1, now you still have Mac OS that people are still writing some apps for.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.720]   But there's this huge group like the idea, we had this iPad app, you know, Mix Effect
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.640]   Pro, which we use for our switching.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.680]   And what's crazy is that we were like, well, it's on an iPad and they were like, you know,
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.280]   we could screen share if we put this on an M1 and I was like, oh, yeah, we'll just take
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.760]   the iPad app and put it on an M1.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.680]   Now we can run it over, you know, over, over Apple remote desktop or whatever else we want
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.680]   to do.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.600]   The fact that we could just do that, when I did that, I was just like, oh, this is pretty
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:36.600]   cool.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.240]   Like, you know, this is a pretty good setup.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.920]   And I think that you're just going to see this integration between all of those.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.080]   And then of course, then they'll still be, you know, the Mac OS that supports the apps
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.720]   that don't fit into that.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.280]   I do see a line of demarcation that is hard to erase.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.480]   I'm supposed to have been doing a really good job of not just making certain user interface
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:01.000]   elements crossover between these two things, which makes for a very nice consistent experience,
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.320]   but also now erasing some of the barriers between the hardware about, well, just just
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.640]   plop your iPad on a stand next to the next computer and admin.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.120]   Today, you can use it as an external screen tomorrow.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.280]   You can actually just interact with it directly.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.480]   Those are wonderful things.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.560]   At the same time, I was really, really pleased at the when Apple introduced, oh, if you want
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.200]   to be able to install iPad apps on your M1 Mac and between developers deciding, no, I
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.360]   don't want you running my iPad app on a Mac.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.080]   What kind of a gutter-smack do you think I am?
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:40.680]   And also the fact that most of these apps that I rely on on my Mac are, if they're internet
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.560]   based, they probably have a really good web interface that for me works at least as well
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.600]   as the iPad experience will.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.320]   I'm not using it that much.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:56.040]   So it's got me rethinking about my idea that my thoughts of how much interaction can there
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:01.960]   be between these two machines and how important it is to make sure that the Mac blurs those
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960]   lines a little bit.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.160]   I want to make sure that I still get as much of a desktop experience as I possibly can.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.440]   I don't want to lose any of that.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.440]   I don't want to give up any power or I have over this device over what I can do with it.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:21.680]   But if it will make things more easier to use and if I will recognize that an alert of
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.800]   the same severity will be delivered exactly the same way with exactly the same sort of
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.360]   severe iconography on both devices while we'll definitely recognize them, I'm hit with
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:32.360]   that absolutely.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.520]   It was a great Steven Sinoski thread on all that about how there's a lot of short-term
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.440]   pain around Apple having so many different platforms on the Mac, like essentially having
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:47.060]   AppKit and then UIKit for Mac, which is catalyst, then having iOS apps and having one of those
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:51.080]   the Chromium apps that I keep forgetting what they're called.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.960]   Electron apps at the same time, there's all these different platforms and it's confusing
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.680]   for us.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:58.360]   We don't really notice it too much and developers have a lot of options.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.960]   But over the mid to short to longer term, a lot of that's going to just coalesce and
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.880]   people will just have the apps that they want.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.280]   I think Sinoski is really smart.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.120]   He's one of the few people that ships software really enormous scale.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.640]   He thinks a lot of this is just short-term turbulence.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.040]   Big story in Bloomberg, a surprising story about Apple car.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.280]   My german writing for the past several years, Apple's car team had explored two simultaneous
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:30.080]   paths, creating a model with limited self-driving capabilities focused on steering and acceleration
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.560]   similar to what we get today.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.480]   Or a version with full self-driving ability that doesn't require human intervention.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.920]   So the new leader, Apple watch software executive Kevin Lynch, engineers who now started concentrating
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.560]   on full self-driving, the second option.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:52.720]   Lynch is pushing for a car with a full self-driving system in the first version.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.400]   And according to german, is pushing for a debut as early as 2025.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.800]   Mark looks at that.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   I bet that that's a number that they've got scribbled down somewhere as boy wouldn't be
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.600]   great if we could ship by 2025.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.120]   I would be very, very surprised if inside Apple they see that as an actual shipping target.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.440]   Because we're still so far away from a really good level four car, let alone a level five
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.440]   car.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.280]   It seems harder to do than anybody.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.960]   Especially Elon Musk realizes.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.720]   Elon Musk is nowhere near level four.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.760]   Waymo cars are generally accepted to be doing level four pretty well.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.680]   But the leap to level five, fully autonomy is still a big deal.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.560]   Apple also, I would love to see, here in reports about how you just can't, you can't throw
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.880]   a stick without hitting an autonomous Apple car being tested somewhere.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:56.240]   Because simulations can do, if you could put a billion miles in simulation and that's a
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.480]   really great training method, that's where almost statistically speaking, nearly all
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.840]   of Google's Waymo's miles are.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.760]   And so Apple could be doing that on the down low.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.400]   However, at some point, you have to start dropping these things on real United States
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:15.240]   streets, not just San Francisco and not just a very, very boxed in suburb of Arizona.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.240]   Exactly.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:22.080]   You need to, the hell week, hell week is no, you drop it in Boston.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.520]   Every street is like Boston.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.520]   One way left turn only.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.800]   And there's like every, go to the, here's a circle.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.320]   And then it comes to a point which can have to turn around 170 degrees.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.800]   Little bit blizzard.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.800]   And by the way, there are people who are double parked because you're in a neighborhood where
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.400]   it's accepted that it's okay to double park so long as you're in that building.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:49.560]   And if you, even if you are like an Apple car, you're going to, you're going to get key.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.120]   The next time that car appears, if you, if it decide, Hey, look, a parking space.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.200]   Well, there's a, there seems to be like a, there seems to be a white plastic chair in the way,
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.200]   but that's okay.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:45:59.200]   I can nudge it out of the way.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]   Oh boy.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.000]   All these, but, but mostly, mostly things that cause people to die is something they need
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]   to be heard about.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000]   That's not going to happen.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.120]   But hey, for 2020, like moving somebody's chair out of their parking spot.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   That is something that good.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120]   Excellent example.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.120]   Exactly.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.680]   The thing that I like most about this is that Kevin Lynch, I had a chance to interview
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.840]   him earlier this year.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:25.040]   And if you haven't seen it, he's just such a great person to talk to because he is like
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.200]   that hardcore inner geek who looks at like the, what is next in technology.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.640]   He wanted to do the Apple Watch because he thought that was a logical place for computing
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   to go next after it was in the hand.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.720]   It's going to move to the wrist.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.160]   But he also thinks really deeply about what the user experience is like what are the, what
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.560]   are the expectations?
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.880]   What do you have to deliver?
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.480]   How do you make something that takes like health data, but makes it accessible to people?
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.320]   He really thinks about a lot of the human side of the electronics.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.560]   And that's why I was really excited when he moved into the position.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:59.520]   I think that Doug Field left previously because he's going to look at this in terms of not
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.800]   just like whiz bang, AI, you know, computational car thing.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.640]   And yes, John Jean-Andrea, I think is still the senior vice president in charge of this
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   project.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.560]   But with, with Kevin Lynch, I think you're really going to see him focus on what makes
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.680]   us a human experience in a car.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:18.280]   I also don't think full set like the rumor was going to be a steering wheel in this.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.880]   And I don't see that happening for a couple of decades.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.600]   Like there's nothing I can grab if that chair is being moved by Alex and Andy is coming
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.600]   up with a shotgun.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600]   I need a steering wheel.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   I can grab on to get out of there as fast as possible.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   No steering wheel.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.600]   I think there's a lot of this down.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.600]   No pedals.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.880]   It's interior designed around hands off driving kind of like a living room.
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:40.280]   According to German, one option discussed inside the company features an interior similar
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.840]   to the one you're seeing if you're watching the video from the canoe, which basically
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.560]   is like a stretch limo.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.800]   You're all the way around the perimeter of the car.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.280]   I still think the cap got caught up.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.080]   I think the license and apple fleet you won't like have an individual car.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.080]   The service.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.080]   I just want a box.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.600]   I just want a box that has that is my little apartment that is that I have a.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:47:59.600]   Goes anywhere.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   I can sleep.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.600]   I can work out.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.600]   I can watch a movie.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   I can do it on one of yours.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   And it just goes.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   That's a great idea.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   It's just a thing.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   No, that's all I wanted.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:09.760]   It would have to be like Mercedes spritter size, right?
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.640]   But a box and you just a box and it and it's got a bad feeling.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   I don't know if I need to live in it.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.040]   It just means that if I want to go to the LA, I'm not I just get in the thing and go
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:21.120]   to sleep and you wait and I go to sleep and I wake up and I'm in LA.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.120]   Who you just call it when you wanted it.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.280]   Ultimately, I think I probably want to keep it because I don't think I want to share this.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   It's your box.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   Surfaces.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.720]   You don't want to sleep on a sleep on a pullout couch that's been.
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.720]   That's been there.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:36.480]   There's like there's like 20 minutes.
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.480]   Yeah, no.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.200]   The thing that I always see missing inside all of these conceptual compartments isn't
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.200]   the steering wheel.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.200]   It's how are you?
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.040]   What are you doing for passenger restraint systems?
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.920]   Because I assume that you're not going to be floating along at a stately two and a half
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:49.920]   miles an hour.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.880]   I always want to see who gets to who gets to be the person who again, you have to make
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.000]   sure that if you're going to be a fun on the highway, yes, I do want to like lay down and
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.640]   have a nap or something, but I also want to be able to survive a rollover.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.920]   If you could have a rotating round bed in the playboy jet, we could figure out a way
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.200]   to get Alex's box on the road.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.200]   We spent a lot.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.440]   I spent a whole childhoods like we built.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:18.000]   We used to build forts in the back of the station wagon.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000]   You know that you dig into.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   Yeah, you sleep in there.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]   Apple.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]   There's again for the work.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]   The word you keep out laws back then.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.400]   Yeah, and we were happy, right?
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400]   As goes of us survived.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:34.600]   Can I just say before before we continue with this?
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.160]   My passenger restraint system coming back from family vacations and the way way back of the
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.920]   station wagon was all the laundry from the entire week.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.680]   Yeah, I was the safest person inside that car.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.680]   Yeah, you were swaddled.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.840]   Yeah, for me, for me was that in the Hermit crabs that we had collected at the beach.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.840]   Oh, God.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.880]   I remember driving around France when I was 11 with a giant wheel of Parmesan cheese,
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.080]   would not have provided much protection in the case of a good conversationalist at least
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.080]   that I would have died.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.080]   But you know what?
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.960]   Had the gas tank ruptured, there'd been a fire.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:10.040]   You have been one of those delicious corpses in the entire world.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.000]   Like, God, we have fun.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.880]   Do everybody.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.000]   All the doctors would have been like, we're not going to do this.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.360]   We're not supposed to do this.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.880]   But let's just take a moment to acknowledge that we want to do this.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.520]   We've gone dark.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.920]   Back to german, Apple has also explored designs with the cars in the infotainment system.
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.920]   Likely a large iPad like touchscreen would be in the middle of the vehicle, letting users
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.400]   interact with it throughout a ride.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.560]   The car would also be heavily integrated with Apple's existing services, of course,
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:40.880]   and devices.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.920]   Although the company is pushing to not have a standard steering wheel, they have discussed
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.920]   equipping the car with the emergency takeover mode.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.920]   It's a party bus, though.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.920]   It's a party bus.
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.520]   Recently, the company, now this is the most interesting bit in here.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.000]   Of course, as usual with markets like at the bottom.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.960]   Recently, the company reached a key milestone in developing the car's underlying self-driving
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.480]   system.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.360]   People were familiar with the situation said.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:10.560]   I think probably the Bloomberg editor has a key combination with that in there.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.400]   Apple believes it has completed much of the core work on the processor.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:18.000]   It attends to eventually ship in the first generation of the car.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.080]   But it has an M in the name, or maybe C, or T for Titan.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.080]   T for Titan.
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.080]   T for Titan.
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:29.880]   By Apple's Silicon engineering group, rather than within the car team itself, the work
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:34.600]   has included honing the underlying software that runs on the chip to power the self-driving
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.600]   capabilities.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.440]   This is the benefit of owning your own silicon.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:44.960]   You wouldn't want the car team to make the chip, not when you have that silicon.
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.760]   Who would make the car?
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:49.920]   There were rumors a while ago that it would be an Austrian company called Magna.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:54.720]   They make cars for other companies like Jaguar's I-Pace.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.040]   I'm going to call it.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.040]   Tada.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:59.040]   Tada.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.640]   Tada is going to make the car.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.760]   Tada is Russian.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.960]   No, Tada is Indian.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   Indian, that's right.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960]   Indian.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960]   They're the big car manufacturers.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.960]   Big Indian.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960]   Big Indian.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.960]   But I think it's a good deal to warm up.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:12.960]   Tada makes it.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:13.960]   Then you could be in the Indian market.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:14.960]   Yes, you can.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.960]   Yes, you can.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.000]   Safety is a major piece of the puzzle.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.080]   According to German, Apple is looking to build stronger safeguards than what's available
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:26.880]   from Tesla and Waymo, including plenty of redundancy, the ability for layers of backup
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.160]   systems to kick in to avoid safety and driving system failures.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.560]   They are, and we know this because we've seen the listings actively looking to hire
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:37.680]   engineers to test to develop safety functions.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.240]   They'll test it with the Apple shuttle system.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.240]   They'll just roll it out to all the Apple employee shuttles.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.640]   They're hiring more self-driving and car-hardware engineers.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.640]   By the way, congratulations.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.800]   You've been accepted into the new employee shuttle program.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:57.640]   We're going to ask for you to put these circular stickers with these little traixing markers
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.560]   on you and also wave the jumpsuit with these dime markers on it.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:04.600]   Absolutely no reason why it's just a point of pride sort of thing.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:11.080]   Apple hired CJ Moore, a Tesla's former self-driving software director recently.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:17.400]   They also tapped a climate system expert from Volvo, a manager from Daimler Trucks, battery
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.400]   systems engineers from Karma Automotive, and other car makers who sense their engineer
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:28.160]   from GM's crews, automotive safety engineers from companies like Joyce and Safety Systems,
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.480]   and multiple other engineers from Tesla.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:38.880]   This all comes from, there's somebody at Bloomberg scouring LinkedIn to find all this stuff.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:44.080]   The company's also hiring software engineers to work on "experiences" for human interaction
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.160]   with autonomous technology.
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:51.040]   You look out the window in this Jurassic Park, you don't have to look at the 205 or whatever
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.040]   anymore.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.520]   You just look out there and it's like Wonderland.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:54:00.040]   They've discussed being compatible with the current CCS charging system.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.560]   That's electrify America.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.560]   Not Tesla, but...
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   Not MagSafe.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.280]   They're not MagSafe.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.520]   I think a MagSafe charger would be.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:09.520]   There's no reason you couldn't do it.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.520]   A hilarious CCS MagSafe.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.520]   Giant MagSafe would be amazing.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.520]   In that way, if you drive off, no big deal.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.360]   Yeah, it's a pop-up.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:24.240]   They have debated internally several different business models, including creating a self-driving
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.240]   fleet.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.760]   A la Waymo.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.120]   A more likely scenario, however, is Apple offering the cars for individual ownership.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.120]   I guess that depends a little bit on when they do it.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.120]   2025.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.520]   They're still going to want to buy cars.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.520]   Anyway, big story.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:45.640]   Bring in the project Titan back to life.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:50.920]   It's super interesting because every time you come back to this, I have no idea why they're
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.920]   pursuing this.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.760]   That's not an accusation.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:54.760]   That's not a complaint.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:58.960]   I'm saying that when they come up with a fitness watch, it's like you understand exactly why
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:02.480]   they're doing it because it enhances the iPhone and enhances their whole initiatives.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.200]   I don't understand what business they're trying to pursue here.
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:11.360]   I don't know if it's as simple as understanding that Apple, amongst its very legitimate technical
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.800]   things, is also a very, very successful luxury consumer goods brand.
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:21.040]   They could sell a really caught $80,000 electric car if they wanted to, whether they want to
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.120]   get into fleet services, whether they want to license all the technology.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.160]   Honest to God, every single time I mess this question on the radio or anywhere else, it
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.960]   has to start with, "I have no idea why they're doing this and I couldn't be more excited
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:33.960]   for that reason."
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:40.200]   I think that at Apple's size, you have to keep on looking for really big markets.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:47.760]   I think that Apple wants to keep on adding segments to their sales that are between $10
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760]   and $20 billion.
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:49.840]   I think that's the target.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:50.840]   It's my guess.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.720]   It's $10 to $25 billion and they want a segment of that.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:54.720]   You see a lot of them.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.400]   They're averaging a lot of things out at about right now about $9 billion across many different
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:03.560]   segments, whether it's services or this or that or the other thing.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:09.320]   I think continuing to add things that are going to generate that is useful from a large business
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.320]   perspective.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.600]   I think that Apple could pick almost anything that I drive a car.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.320]   The way I look at cars are the way I used to look at phones before the iPhone, which was
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:22.120]   that this is the one I hate the least.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:24.960]   I don't love the car that we drive.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:25.960]   It's fine.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.440]   It gets us from one place to the other.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:30.520]   If Apple added a bunch of really cool things, I probably get attached to it.
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:31.520]   I get attached to it.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.520]   Apple made microwaves.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.760]   The thing is that because they work really well and they would run from my phone and
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]   I wouldn't have to think about it.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.280]   It would just do the same thing.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.280]   Same thing with the...
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.960]   Apple can go into a lot of these things, but I think they're looking for markets large
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:49.080]   enough that they have a reasonably good chance of making $10 to $25 billion a year on it.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.520]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.280]   My question for myself is why cars, why something that is so...
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:59.680]   By the way, historically low margin industry.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:01.080]   That's the way the phones were.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.520]   They were historically low margin industry and then Apple came in and something different.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:08.200]   Well, there's still a low margin industry when you look at it.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   Except for Apple.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.960]   The phones are exactly except for Apple.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.560]   The idea of my questions to myself is that they could also create this brand new business,
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.880]   like you say, by getting into finance, getting into financial services.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:26.280]   They are, but not at this scale and not at this sort of...
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:27.280]   Not yet.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.640]   It's like they are two inches from the bank.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.520]   They could also be getting into the Apple Pie filling.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:35.200]   The Canada Apple Pie and Cranberry Sauce fill is business.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.200]   As far as we know.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.720]   It's fascinating to me because this is not like we're going to use everything that we
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.800]   already know about building this kind of consumer electronics and build this other kind of consumer electronics.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:49.840]   Or all the stuff that we built internally for our cloud services, we're going to create
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.320]   cloud services and business services we can sell to other people.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:58.200]   It seems like such a different thing to say this is a market that we...
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:04.240]   And the abstract might have been prepared to get into, but it has such little intersection
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:07.120]   with anything they've sold before.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.880]   The retail chain is so different.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.360]   The ways that you can sell package and sell the technology is so different.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.600]   Again, this is not me making an accusation that they're doing something silly.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.040]   It just means that I do...
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.640]   I absolutely agree that they're looking...
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:23.600]   They're always going to be looking for ways to create brand new businesses that only a
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.120]   company at their market cap can actually create and...
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.840]   But it's interesting to me to figure out what kind of product they think they're going
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.560]   to go and part of the story...
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.920]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I really am getting to get into this.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:38.360]   I'm being very rude because I'm kind of put this fine.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.360]   It's all good.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:43.000]   All I'm saying is that it was one of the things I liked about the story was that it really
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.440]   did indicate that even Apple had not really decided what they're going to be using this
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.240]   technology for or what the end game was.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:51.760]   And it seems as though they're narrowing...
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:56.440]   If these rumors are true, that they are figuring out that, "Okay, we're not going to just be
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:00.600]   building software and hardware that other car makers can use to build their own cars.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:03.280]   We do want to have our own plate, our own brand."
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:06.560]   And maybe that is just going to be a testbed for technology they could sell with people.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:10.120]   Like I said, it's exciting to me because I really have no idea what they're going to
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.120]   do with this.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.120]   And it's great.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:13.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.120]   I think the parallel with the iPod...
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:18.360]   The parallel with the iPod and the parallel with the phone is, again, markets that other
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.600]   people are already in, not making much money on it.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.520]   iPod comes in, makes a bunch of money.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:23.880]   iPhone comes in, makes a bunch of money.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.280]   I watch, comes in, makes a bunch of money.
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.320]   People made fun of them on all of those.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:30.640]   We have to remember, we've been on these shows where people made fun of the idea that why
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.160]   would they ever go into a watch because there's tons of great watches and there's all this
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.160]   other stuff.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.160]   And now I don't know anybody.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.880]   I don't see anything other than Apple Watch at this point.
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.000]   And so the thing is that the...
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.240]   Or a mechanical watch, but I don't see Android watches around.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.240]   And so...
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240]   I see it's everywhere.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.240]   You must be going around on gyms.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.240]   Maybe I'm going to the wrong gym.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.240]   I have my own gym.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:55.240]   So anyway, so the...
[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:57.560]   But I think that Apple can easily move into those.
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:01.760]   Now, I do think it's interesting that you mentioned financial services, Andy, because
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:05.600]   if Apple ever decided to go into that, and I know that that sounds crazy, but Apple does
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:10.320]   crazy things that it can do, but they are between Apple Cash and the card.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.760]   They are so close.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.560]   They're sitting there just kind of floating around in this little area.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:20.000]   Now, if you had a bank, if you had a bank and then you were selling all this stuff, you'd
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.840]   have people buying, getting loans from the bank that's by the things that you own.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:29.080]   You're describing it as a dystopian company store where Apple makes and sells everything
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:30.080]   that we use.
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.600]   That is a future I'm not sure I want to live in.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.600]   I have something to say.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.760]   I'm just saying it's just highly competitive.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:36.760]   Yeah, of course.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:37.760]   I don't know if it's as an Apple.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:38.760]   It's very successful.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:40.680]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.680]   I don't...
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:44.560]   Everything would work well together.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:45.560]   So...
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.920]   I have a theory on the car thing.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.840]   I think it's one of those things where Apple executives tend to be really plain spoken in
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:55.000]   candidate times and because we're not used to it, we just assume that they're lying
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.800]   or performing or something.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:00.760]   Like Jeff Williams once, much of the consternation that Apple PR at the time said that the car
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.040]   is the ultimate mobile device.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:04.360]   It was something that Apple was really interested in.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.040]   Tim Cook has talked several times about how he believes the key technology of the future
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.280]   are augmented reality and automation.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.640]   Automation can take many forms, but the car he thinks is one of the most important ones.
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:19.200]   The whole basis of the Cook Doctrine is that they will enter product categories where
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.320]   they believe that there's a sufficiently large market and that Apple can offer highly
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.360]   differentiated value to their customers.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:32.520]   It looks like the car is entering this territory where the phone was entering, when Apple started
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:37.880]   like engaging with that because we had things like plentiful mobile networks and miniaturized
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:38.880]   technology.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.680]   Just the ingredients, the soup was all there.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:42.800]   It just wasn't really well seasoned yet.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.400]   Now we have the advent of EVs, like electrical cars, and we have these neural networks that
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.400]   are capable of doing limited forms, maybe better forms of self-driving.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.120]   It feels like we're going to have a shift in what the core technologies are surrounding
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:56.120]   cars.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.880]   Apple might just simply feel that this place to a lot of their core competences, things
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.880]   that they're really good at, and is a unique opportunity in the history of cars.
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:07.040]   They ever wanted to get involved with them and that there's a sufficiently large market
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:10.840]   that they can make a lot of money if they have something ready at the right time.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:13.080]   I think maybe it's just as simple as that.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:16.960]   A couple of quick stories before we get ready for our picks of the week.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:17.960]   These could be picks.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:23.200]   Apple Shopping Event Black Friday is just around the corner.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:29.640]   Apple has a number of offers ranging from $50 to $200.
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:32.280]   You can do your own research.
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:35.080]   I guess these aren't all online yet.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.080]   Oh, there it is.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.680]   $50 Apple gift card when you buy an iPhone 12.
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.320]   $75 Apple gift card if you get AirPods.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.560]   That's money staying with Apple?
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.200]   Yeah, that's the beauty of these gift cards, isn't it?
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:52.440]   $100 gift card for an iPad Pro, $12.9 or $11.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.760]   Max $200 with a 27-inch iMac.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:58.760]   Just take a look at it.
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.400]   It's all online now at the Apple store.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.400]   Micah before the show began was singing the praises of the new updated Pixelmator Pro.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.880]   I think we all own copies of Pixelmator Pro.
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:18.520]   The new 2.3 update has now some new remove background command that automatically detects
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.480]   the subject and erases the background.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480]   More fine-grained.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480]   It's so fast with those neural engines too.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.640]   Yeah, the AI enhanced selection options.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:30.760]   So I'm a big fan of Pixelmator Pro.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.760]   It's getting better and better and better.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.840]   I think it's very inexpensive.
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.480]   If you're new to it, it's on sale 50% off.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.360]   So this would be a good time to get your Pixelmator Pro on.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:47.160]   Wirecutter is on strike for Black Friday, but every other news outlet in the universe
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:50.160]   is going to be flooding your feeds with deals the entire week.
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.360]   That was actually my next and last story.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.400]   Wirecutter has not been able to reach a deal with the New York Times.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:00.120]   So the Wirecutter Union has announced that they will be striking.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:04.440]   100% of the unit will be striking from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:10.360]   And encourage people who would normally buy going to the Wirecutter to boycott for those
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:11.360]   four days.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.520]   And I'm a big fan of the Wirecutter, a big supporter of it.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:16.760]   I totally agree.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:17.760]   And I want to support him.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.120]   So I won't be using the Wirecutter for my blog.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.480]   They also sealed it behind a login wall, which I thought was really odd for a site that
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.240]   was designed based on affiliate revenue conversion.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.280]   You go there now and they want you to sign in and you can account.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:33.240]   I think you have to have a paid, it's a paywall.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   I think.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.680]   For some of the New York Times.
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:42.440]   So I'm not sure what the requirements are, but I get it obviously without.
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:43.680]   It's very, very timely.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.520]   If you scroll back in the tweet history, they're talking about the workers are talking about
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.160]   how here is how much money that New York Times announced that they were making off
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:56.000]   of Wirecutter, I should not have to be on food assistance in order to continue to do
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000]   this job.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000]   So goodbye.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000]   So this is the part where-
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.160]   I haven't subscribed from the New York Times using their horrible- like you can subscribe
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.240]   online, but you have to unsubscribe with a telephone call.
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.240]   That should be legal.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:07.400]   In fact, the ridiculously-
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:08.400]   FTC.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.320]   The US FTC is looking into that.
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.720]   They've said that that should not be, you should be able to cancel the same way you signed
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   up.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.720]   So that may-
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   Can I-
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.160]   This is also timely for Thanksgiving holiday.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.520]   I want to sign up for Disney Plus just so I can just watch the Disney documentary and then
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:25.520]   cancel, but I'm not going to because-
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.520]   The Beatles documentary.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.520]   The Beatles documentary.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:29.520]   I'm sorry, the Beatles documentary.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:30.520]   It's a self.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:31.520]   Disney considers that we own everything.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.520]   So why-
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.520]   The Beatles, sure.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.520]   I'm sure they do.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:35.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.800]   Tony Stark was a saxophone player in the rebooted version of The Beatles.
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:38.800]   But yeah, but-
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:39.800]   But just-
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:40.800]   But you don't have to-
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:41.800]   Just-
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:42.800]   I'll tell it, Andy.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:45.800]   The simple fact that I don't- please show me a walkthrough what it's like to unsubscribe
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.680]   from you because if I'm going to have to go through like a phone tree that takes 45 minutes
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.360]   to navigate and then have to keep checking my credit card account to make sure that you
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:56.000]   actually processed it, it's not worth that.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000]   I would actually much rather pirate it.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000]   Dude, I would iPad, Andy.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.560]   Dude on your iPad because it goes through iTunes and you can just hit the iTunes button
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.560]   to unsubscribe.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.560]   Yep.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.560]   Good point.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:05.560]   Thank you, Apple.
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:06.560]   Oh, brilliant.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.560]   There we go.
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:08.560]   Brilliant.
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.560]   There we go.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:10.560]   That's why we like Apple.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:11.560]   That's why we like Apple.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:12.560]   We go to subscription and go nope.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:13.560]   Yep.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:14.560]   I love that feature.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:15.560]   I love that feature.
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.560]   Some of them don't let you do that, but Disney does play nicely.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.560]   It's worth it.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:19.680]   I'm slowly- I have to admit I'm slowly unwinding all the ones, including Netflix.
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:20.680]   I'm looking to get him into Netflix.
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:21.680]   I don't watch it enough.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:24.640]   And I'm just like, man, it's an external subscription.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:28.920]   If you're not watching Succession on HBO Max, you're missing the best TV show.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:32.800]   So the trick is you subscribe to Netflix, you watch The Witcher and you catch up on everything
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:35.280]   else that you're missing here than the next month as Disney Plus.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.120]   You watch all the Star Wars and Marvel stuff.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.120]   Too much trouble.
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.120]   Too much trouble.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.120]   Too much trouble.
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.560]   It's migratory streaming, Leo.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:48.120]   I do like- As a fan of The Wheel of Time novels, I'm only up through six now.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.120]   It takes a lot.
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:50.120]   How is it?
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.120]   They're very long.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.120]   I love it.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.120]   And The Wheel of Time Show just came out on Amazon Prime.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.120]   Is it good?
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.120]   Yeah.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:56.120]   You know what?
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.840]   I'm really curious what somebody who has not read the books thinks of it.
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:06:59.840]   It looked good.
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:01.080]   I was like, oh, that looks good.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.080]   I think it's good.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:03.080]   I think you're doing it.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:04.080]   It's very, it's fair.
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.960]   There's some changes you have to make changes.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:08.320]   But I think they're doing a good job.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.240]   And I think it's apparently getting better and better.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:12.600]   So as we're reviewing shows, one of the ratings like-
[02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:14.080]   Oh my god.
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.460]   Ten years ago, and they haven't bought it out yet, and they didn't announce Wheel of
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:17.720]   Time and it just came out.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:18.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:23.560]   They spent a lot of money, $10 million in episode, they said.
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:26.600]   Only has eight episodes, but it's greenlit for a second season.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.840]   So probably Jennifer Aniston's pay-all-
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:29.840]   Just kidding.
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.840]   Preface.
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:31.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:35.840]   I think just in case you're wondering, Redcode is pretty much cotton candy.
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:36.840]   Red Note is really fun.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:37.840]   Red Note is.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.840]   Oh god, I hate it.
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:39.840]   It's a cotton candy.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:40.840]   So hard.
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.840]   It was fun.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.840]   I just-
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:43.840]   I just thought it was funny.
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.840]   It's low rent James Bond.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:45.840]   It's awful.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:46.840]   It is.
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:47.840]   It was, it was, it was, I thought it was wonderfully awful.
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:48.840]   It's high rent Ryan.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:49.840]   I would never recommend it.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:50.840]   I would never recommend it.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:51.840]   I think Lisa's candy.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.840]   It's just like there's nothing there.
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:53.840]   And he thinks he shares your opinion.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.840]   Yeah, there's nothing.
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:55.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:58.760]   Nothing there, but it was kind of like, oh, I got, I got about two thirds into it.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:01.520]   I left for a while and I came back and I was like, no, I just didn't miss anything.
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:04.240]   It's actually, it's, it's brown Reynolds.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.240]   It's really funny.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.240]   Reynolds is great.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:07.600]   There's a Vin Diesel joke though.
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:08.760]   Yeah, there is.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:09.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.760]   Reynolds is all right.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:17.120]   The problem is nobody else in the movie Gal Gadot, the rock can, can deliver a line like
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.120]   Ryan can.
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.120]   So it just, he's so sincere.
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:21.120]   He's so good.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.600]   He's so Canadian about his humor.
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.600]   Oh, funny.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:24.600]   He's so funny.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.600]   Like I did watch right.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.840]   It proves, Red Notice proves that I can watch Ryan Reynolds.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.840]   Anytime.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:30.840]   Yeah.
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.040]   Like it's so much, I just enjoy it.
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.680]   Like I just, it's just like a good relax.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.200]   You know, I'm just going to watch his Nickelback video.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.400]   You'll just, you'll just be delighted.
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.320]   Is there anything on the Ted Lasso channel is worth watching these days?
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.200]   No, that's just, that was just a chance to make a joke.
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:46.200]   That's all.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:47.800]   I'm very excited about the Beatles thing.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:49.800]   That is going to be Peter Jackson.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.480]   Lot of found footage from the Beatles taping video or filming of their Let It Be recording
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:56.480]   sessions.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:58.520]   That's going to be quite amazing on Disney Plus.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.520]   Yeah.
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:00.520]   Also all upscaled.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.360]   He is a really good interview with him on Deadline.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:07.000]   I would tell it was, you can tell it was a, well, email me the questions and I'll respond
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000]   to them.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.920]   But it really did show the difference between his job in 2021 versus the original director
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.920]   in 1970.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:14.920]   And you're right.
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:15.920]   I watched it on a fork.
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:18.000]   I watched the previews on a 4K monitor.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.320]   It's, I've never seen it look so, I mean, you feel like you're right there.
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:24.960]   It's really 16 millimeter film has started off as, but really, oh, I didn't realize.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.760]   They must have done that on 35 millimeter or something.
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.760]   Wow.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:29.760]   Yep.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.760]   It looks good.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.560]   So that's a six hour documentary premieres.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.720]   Thanksgiving, if you can pry the TV away from the football viewers.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:36.720]   Oops.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:37.720]   I'm sorry I closed that.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:39.560]   I will put it back for you.
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:44.400]   Also, also the hydraulic press channel like has driven like a thousand nails with the
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.080]   150 ton hydraulic press, which is easily as entertaining as anything that any streaming
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.040]   channel paid a half a billion dollars for.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.040]   Okay.
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:54.160]   You can tell he doesn't want to spend a dime on streaming.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:58.920]   I'm saying this is why I have so much sympathy as much, as much crap as I give like Disney,
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:03.160]   these other companies will like, my God, you, you put so much money and so much work and
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.480]   so much passion into this.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.600]   And I'm just like sitting there with the streaming box saying, okay, billion dollar sci-fi franchise.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:10.600]   Okay.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.600]   Half a billion dollar movie.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:12.600]   Oh, hydraulic.
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:13.600]   Oh my God.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.840]   They're not trying to drive, drive nails.
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.840]   Okay.
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.840]   I'm in for the night.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:21.600]   It happened, it happened, it happened the day after Disney day where it was like nothing,
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.600]   but analysis.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.920]   And now we have this other TV series.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:27.760]   This other movie and this other series coming out and I'm like, okay, that's kind of interesting,
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:30.520]   but like this was the, oh my God, I'm so excited.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:32.720]   What time does the video start at four before PM?
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:33.720]   Okay.
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:34.720]   I'm not doing any podcasts.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.560]   I'm not, I'm canceling the surgery.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.960]   I'm definitely seeing the hydraulic press panel.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:39.960]   Okay.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.560]   Andy, documentaries on Disney Plus are great too.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.040]   Like if you ever just want to like, it's not what you expect either.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.480]   It's like John Favreau and the ILM people having this really long discussion about the
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.120]   ethics of deep fakes and, and what we're going to be in for with this technology.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:55.440]   We're building just to make Mark Hamill look young and how it's going to affect politics
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:58.320]   in the next five years, which I find endlessly fascinating.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:06.120]   And I guess now I have to play the hydraulic press channel trailer because it is amazingly
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:07.120]   good.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.120]   Andy is now completely sold us on watching the hydraulic press.
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:12.880]   I've watched AVE on YouTube.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:13.880]   Andy.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:17.640]   I think it's a channel that I recognize and think of them.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.120]   It's an old Quebec minor who just talks about tutors.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.320]   I have to say, I know the one to talk for you some for, for, you know, the new world of
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:28.920]   media, there is nothing like YouTube.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.920]   It's amazing.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.720]   Yeah, it's amazing to, it's just nice and nice and school.
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.280]   You might, you might appreciate this.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.040]   20 years ago, I was in Chinatown.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:40.120]   I spent most of my high school years in Chinatown and I saw a version of Chen Tai Chi that was
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:43.280]   the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life, but I couldn't get anybody to teach
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:45.120]   me and I haven't seen it in 20 years.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:46.440]   I found it yesterday on YouTube.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.800]   Oh my God.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.800]   Everything's there.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:55.940]   The guy who I saw is just it's a whole thing on YouTube is amazing. There's a lot of talking in this hydraulic press channel
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:12:01.360]   No before they get into it yeah, and the thing is like then you see well
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.200]   Well what they're gonna do they just gonna like to watch the exposition is that part of the fun of it?
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.200]   Is you like a Swedish?
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:15.280]   Swedish and I think the first time I saw the actual couple I thought that wow they're not like 78 years old they're actually it's
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:22.500]   Teracle yeah, I watch them on the tiktok. It's the it's a little faster a little less a little less exposition on the tiktok
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.220]   that's true
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.860]   It's the story telling that I'm into it's like
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:31.540]   They're creating the why they're creating a whole world
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:33.940]   It's the hydraulic press cinematic universe
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:39.500]   Leel it's not just how it's why why are they doing it? What is their motivation now?
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:44.680]   They are compressing they're trying to figure out how many soda cans you could fit into a Pringles can with
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:45.680]   a
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.360]   So see that's the only aspect is to toad it up so yeah
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:56.820]   I mean again, I'm like oh is that's gonna be fun and then like a three-messentrum like I kind of want to know how many
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:02.160]   Can I get it's gonna be more than a hundred less than the end you'll have to watch yourself no spoilers
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:04.160]   No spoilers one point I

[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:23.420]   play this one the hydraulic press
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:26.060]   Versus paper
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:28.160]   Oh, that's amazing
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:39.520]   Exploded it like okay, it's paper okay big deal and then paper has a high compression ratio
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.280]   Here's post it notes
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:45.680]   And the ones with the with the new playing cards, I think
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:53.240]   Paper you know you can compress a bunch of stuff, but paper here's a pile of books
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:59.680]   It's just as fairly loud this here's the playing cards sometimes
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:08.680]   It is pretty funny
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:15.800]   Okay, enough hydraulic press humor, let's get your pick of the week right there. We're named Richie
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.020]   I was just telling Andy before if he hasn't watched a V. E. It's this old
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:25.600]   Talk about how these chooschers. Yeah, tabernacle up and down and spin around it's awesome
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.760]   Can I say before you leave this he's also at a really really really experience and how things are manufactured?
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:35.880]   So it's not like hey look this stupid. This is he's like, okay. I think that is for
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:42.460]   20 for 80 plastic. Let's find out. I've got I've got a test kit to make sure oh that's actually a very very good high density
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:44.760]   And high density nylon is gonna stay up very nice
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:50.680]   So it's it's actually you you you go in for all the really cool like verbiage that he is kind of amazing
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:54.220]   You stay for the while I know I know exactly why Harper could make minor dialect is
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:58.960]   It's sublime. It's if you haven't heard it really amazing what you can see on
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.760]   YouTube so I have another YouTube thing to point you towards yes, and it's I know everyone's gonna see it anyway
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:10.080]   But mr. Beast Jimmy Donaldson who is probably the most popular youtuber in the world right now
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.240]   He has spent the last few weeks months
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:19.080]   Millions and millions of dollars recreating squid game. Oh for YouTube for a video
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:21.520]   Not there no one is gonna be killed. This is this is for fun
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:28.760]   But he has built exact replicas of every one of the games he has hundreds of contestants the exact number from the games
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:34.280]   He has all the people from the it looks like the spitting image of the actual show now again
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:38.120]   Nobody's gonna be wounded in this version, but there is a lot of money on the line
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:40.600]   And he's making it as one
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:43.640]   Enormous spectacular. He's got all the sets built
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.600]   Video that's coming out tomorrow afternoon, and I'm fairly certain it's gonna break the internet all on its own
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:53.920]   And if you've seen some of his previous videos, you know that his his whole thing is
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:56.480]   unbelievable spectacle with
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:58.480]   mountains of cash on top of them, but
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:03.520]   You don't like it's just interesting for me to see that this this was a major studio production
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:09.840]   And now a youtuber is doing like a version of it and we live in such an interesting time where people who are creators
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:15.840]   I mean he started off with nothing he's met made his first hundred videos on his I think a Samsung Galaxy phone or an iPhone or something
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:21.040]   And it took him forever to to get any growth on youtube and he he started off with no money either
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.800]   So he read the dictionary. He said words a hundred thousand times. He walked like miles
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:31.120]   He did these things that was just physically really challenging that nobody else had done before
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:35.920]   And then when he started getting sponsors he would ask for the money and then he would give it like his first sponsor
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:37.920]   He gave the money to a homeless person
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:41.520]   And he since then he's been giving all the money that he makes a way
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.160]   uh to make these videos so it's just
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:50.080]   Uh, it's it's amazing to see where creators can go these days because it looks like there are no functional limits anymore
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:54.080]   It's really cool. Does he must now have somebody underwriting him, right?
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.800]   I mean no so his mom is his accountant like his mom didn't want him to go into youtube
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:03.040]   She wanted him to go off to school like you know normal people and he didn't tell her that he was doing youtube
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.440]   But now she's as accountant and she tries to help him with stuff
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:10.080]   But he gets sponsors for some of the videos, uh, but every dollar he makes and he makes
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.520]   He gets
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.040]   billions of views every dollar he makes pretty much puts back into
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.920]   uh into his videos and
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:21.280]   These he doesn't put up videos. He doesn't think would be good
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:24.880]   Like he's made million-dollar videos that he's never posted because he wasn't happy with them
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:27.920]   Wow, so it's just like an incredible work ethic and uh
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.720]   Uh, he won't before he puts up a video. He makes sure he knows what the thumbnail and title are gonna be
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:36.560]   And he doesn't think it's gonna get 40 million views. He's not gonna he's not even gonna make the video
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:38.560]   So it's just uh, mr
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:43.040]   V spends like 24 hours a day focused on it. It's just uh, it's an I think unusual individual
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.080]   I detect some mr
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:46.240]   V's hero worship coming from you mr
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.440]   Ritchie, I you know, I respect the game like it's it's uh, it's
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.520]   I've had a chance to talk to him a little bit
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:54.480]   He's really grounded he doesn't have like a fancy house because he doesn't want
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:57.680]   Like the people who work for him to feel like that's where all their effort is going into
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.880]   Doesn't have his own he gives away a lot of cars doesn't have his own fancy car
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:03.280]   It does like he has very few vices. So it's
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:08.160]   It's just it's nice to see what I think is like a pure youtube creator getting to this level
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:12.160]   And doesn't have to be him. There are people who just do reaction videos and become enormously popular too
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:16.160]   But it's something we know it's something that you could never do without a network behind you in the past
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:19.680]   November 24th
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:21.680]   On his youtube channel
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:24.320]   456 random people
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.520]   competing in exact recreations of every game
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.520]   recreations not recreations recreations of every game
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:35.040]   It is a recreation, but uh recreating every game in
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.960]   Squid game
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.960]   Wow
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:42.320]   Mr. Alex lindsey. I want your pick of the week. How about this?
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:44.560]   So
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:47.360]   My pick a week isn't very expensive in fact I got two of them
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:51.520]   I think for like eight dollars or something like that. This is the paper feel covering for the ipad
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.000]   So it's just a little
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:58.400]   It's really made a big difference and I finally I had one on an old ipad and I
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:02.400]   Haven't had it for a while and I finally put it back on we were talking about an office hours
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:06.320]   Of course and and I remembered how much I loved it and I put and I got it again
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.400]   It's pretty easy to apply and what it does is it creates a little bit of a matte finish
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:19.040]   It's specifically for people to use the pencil right? I mean exactly and so really what it what really makes a difference is that it's just when you're
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:24.880]   When you're drawing on it, it just gives you a little bit of drag that feels much more like a pencil
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:33.280]   On a paper and it's and I realized how much my drawing and my sketching when I'm when I'm working and I'm not even sketching like art art
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:36.560]   I'm doing like this is what I'm going to put in my next keynote presentation
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:44.160]   but but I um but even then I found that my accuracy and what I like my writing gets a lot better when there's a little bit of drag that that
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:46.720]   that completely frictionless
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:49.760]   Interface with it was actually causing it to just be really almost impossible to read
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:52.240]   And when I add that drag back to it
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:57.440]   I just write it like I'm writing on paper and so I you know I felt like it was worth it because it's actually I
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:03.360]   I had it years ago and I thought it was great. Um and I uh um and we were talking about an office hours
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:05.520]   I was like I should do that again and I put it back on and it's
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:11.200]   It's great you can get it on a two pack for 1089 on amazon the paper fuel
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:14.560]   screen protector that's for the 29 inch
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:18.000]   Yeah, and relatively painless to put on. I mean it's a little bit of work to it
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.440]   It's not like it doesn't have one of those forms, but um I did pretty well
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:24.000]   I didn't do perfectly, but it totally works. Nice
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.520]   Yeah, boy. That is that is nothing. That's 170th of an Alex and they said you too
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:35.520]   Don't worry. Don't worry that I've already got the next month set up. I'll make up for it next week. Oh good
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.320]   I'm like, okay
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:39.360]   I'm just giving you all a respite because next week's gonna be expensive
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:42.960]   Alex is hoping to win the squid game so that he can actually afford a lot of the things he's
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:49.360]   Yeah, exactly. Well with the andes help maybe you can save a little money on this black friday andy your pick of the week
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.880]   Yeah, yeah, this is something that a lot of people have probably heard of but need to be reminded of and they forgot what what the name is
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:24:00.720]   Camel camel camel and it literally is camel camel camel calm calm will calm we have all these people who buy up
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:05.040]   URLs to domain names and squad on them to thank us for that URL I think
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:09.440]   But yeah, it's the simplest thing in the world you paste in a link off of off of amazon
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:15.600]   And it will give you a very detailed graph of the fluctuations of that price over a very very long period of time
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.320]   And you can also set up a tracker that says that hey look
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:23.440]   I'm interested in buying this to this countertop oven or this hard drive or this whatever
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:26.640]   Send me alert if the price ever dips below whatever
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:31.520]   And it is absolutely key if there's something that you don't necessarily need to grab right now
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:36.720]   Like when I when my toast revving when I kind of revved and blew up or stopped working
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:42.000]   It was like, okay. Oh, I can see I I really want to replace it today, but I can see that if I wait a little while
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.840]   It's probably going to dip down
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:48.240]   $50 at some point because it always does that great. So I'll hold off and of course and I held off and I waited
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.920]   But it's especially useful during like black friday or any situation where
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:57.120]   Off of wire cutter or any anyplace else you see oh, well, there's a one day special deal
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:01.680]   On a b&h photo or whatever on this thing and you can actually see
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.480]   Excuse me particular on amazon like there's a there's a daily deal on this thing
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:09.440]   I'm like wow that sounds like a really good deal on this sort of thing go to
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:16.560]   Paste in the the the the product number find out that a will actually know that's not a great price or b
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:22.160]   It is a good price, but the thing is this thing keeps going up and down up and down in regular cycles
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.040]   So if I don't get it now, I can probably get it at that same price. Oh, look at that. Oh, that's cool
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:33.040]   Yeah, I think john must use this because he looks like he's uh, that's john's tracker right there. Yeah
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:36.720]   Like I said, it's it's super super useful something sometimes
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:42.320]   It'll also help you kind of figure out the age of a certain certain thing. It doesn't it's not 100
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:46.960]   It's really optimized for amazon, but it's not 100 percent amazon below at the graph
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.360]   It'll also say well offline other places the lowest price that i've ever seen for this is
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:53.120]   $195 or whatever
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:57.680]   Here's the lowest historical price ever on amazon. Uh, and so it really does help you separate
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:00.000]   The really great deals like okay
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.920]   This is clearly a two-year-old version of this phone charger, but which is still 100 percent useful for me
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:11.120]   And this is such a great deal that I can't pass up because i'm looking for this sort of device all the way to
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:16.080]   And now it's like okay. It's nice, but it's not if I don't really need it right now
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.040]   I can certainly wait until january for a break away for something else to happen
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:22.160]   Thank you, andy
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:25.760]   Website's amazing. I've never heard of you. Didn't know about camera camera camera. I must have been
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:29.680]   I must have missed this. I just put in some speakers. I just bought and it made me feel good because
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.320]   Yes, I I I hasn't changed very much. I got a graph. Yeah, it's nice
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:36.400]   But I had a graph and then you look at it and you go what happened?
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.320]   November 30th of 2018 like it dropped by a third
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.240]   Yeah, everywhere like everywhere across the internet. It's interesting
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:46.480]   And it is also good for non amazon stuff
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:50.960]   Like again, if you are about to buy something at b&h photo or new or new egg or whatever to find out
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.720]   Well, is this a great deal?
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:59.360]   Assuming assuming it's not an amazon specific sku it will show you here's what the price has been doing at least on the amazon
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:07.040]   Place and again for for me all oftentimes it really is that I kind of I really want to I really need to get a 12 terabyte
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:09.840]   NAS drive
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.840]   Drive for for my NAS
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:17.440]   But I can wait for a good price to happen. So it's like no whenever this gets below actually that was the last time
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:22.320]   I really used it. I said the next time with this a western digital red 12 terabyte module goes under
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.600]   $300 sudden mean alert and boom and that was after three months of waiting like I got there for the exact
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:33.680]   So spending $380 for it at the time where consider I can get a courage to me that I should probably do that upgrade
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:35.920]   I saved 80 bucks and that was
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:37.920]   well worth it
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:41.120]   Thank Andy. Thank you Renee. Thank you Alex Alex Lindsey's at
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.920]   office hours.global
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.520]   Check it out every morning every well all day long
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:53.520]   Great stuff going on today's show focus on audio plugins office
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.000]   It was a plug-in fest. We were talking about all the different plugins. We like to use an audio. It was very
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:03.360]   Very geeky. It's can be geeky, but there's cooking on the weekends. There's all sorts of stuff
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:08.320]   I got up this morning and I somehow left the speaker on in my office and
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:13.200]   I could hear people talking. I was like are they building an interface? I walked in at like five o'clock in the morning
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:18.720]   And there's people building an editing interface an interface to control a PTZ across the world
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.640]   And they're building this web interface and they're all talking about it. Okay. Let's try to move the slider
