[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly a chance to sit around
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and gas shoot the breeze about topics of Macintosh.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And today is Veterans Day.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I don't know if we say happy Veterans Day,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   but we do want to send out a shout out to all the folks,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   all the men and women who have served their country
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   in the Armed Forces.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And you know, because we're an international show,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   about 30% of Ryan's is international.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   This is also Remembrance Day or Armistice Day
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   around much of the world.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So we say a salute to everybody who served
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   in the Armed Forces of any nation out there.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's a great sacrifice we know and a very important one.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I would be wearing a red poppy if I had one.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Imagine that I'm wearing a red poppy.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Andy Inako is a red poppy, I believe.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Andy Inako from Chicago sometimes.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Andy?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm actually more of a summer,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   although I can pull off a fuchsia.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You're not a Gentone.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   You're not a Gentone, huh?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, a Gentone, huh?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I think you'd look good in the gem tones
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and the basic colors there.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Your girlfriend, I look good in anything.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Are you a winner?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Andy is...
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Oh, he had my soul.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   From the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Also the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, C-W-O-B dot com.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Scott Born is not with us today because he's a veteran
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   of Vietnam veteran and is the Grand Marshal.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   What did he say?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Is it the Gig Harbor parade?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   He's a Grand Marshal of his local Veterans Day parade,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   which I think is so cool.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And you sent a nice note, I thought, to him.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, it was, I mean, it was where he told me
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   that he was marching in the parade and I just replied,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   because it was weird because just earlier that day,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I was looking forward to Veterans Day and just reflecting
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   on the fact that mine was trying to figure out
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   whether my generation was the second,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   maybe the third at the most, only the second generation
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   in the 20th century, where you're a kid
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and you're growing up in high school and you don't have to worry
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   about whether you're going to be spending your college years
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   at war because every generation before mine,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   you know, you make your plans for you thinking,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   well, I might be overseas, I might be shooting at people,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I might have people shooting at me.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And that was a very, very weird, that's a very weird
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and interesting thing and I know that it's the people who served
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   in uniform in the past and the people who serve in uniform
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   today that allowed me to basically pack around at RPI
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   for four years and not worry about being shut up.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It's true, I am Scott's a little, a year or two older than me.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And there, but for the grace of God,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   that's the divide.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I was in the last year of the lottery.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I had a high number, but they didn't end up drafting people
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   from that year and then that was it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And the only, I don't know if Scott was drafted or enlisted,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   somehow knowing Scott, I suspect he enlisted,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   but we'll ask him the story.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   But he is in the marshals float in his parade,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   probably in Gig Harbor.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So Scott, we salute you and all our veterans,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and thank you for your service to keep this country free.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   On the line with us, a first timer, a newbie,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   John Redinger, he is, you might have seen him on YouTube,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   his channel, John number four Lakers,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   or go to john4lakers.com.j-o-n,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   features all things geeky and it's really good to have
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   some fresh blood on here.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   John, welcome.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm very happy to be here.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   How did you get started?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yes.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You've been doing this.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You've got 10,000 subscribers, quarter of a million channel views.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's a lot.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   12,000 videos watched.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   How many videos do you have?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   How many videos do you have on here?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I think I've got somewhere around 150 videos.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Wow.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I got started.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I was looking to buy my first Apple MacBook Pro
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   about a year and a half ago.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I was looking around YouTube and there really weren't
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   that many good videos.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So I created an account just to comment on what videos there were.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And when I got my first computer,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I figured it'd be fun to make a video and things kind of grew from there.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   There was a very quick response.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And I really enjoyed making videos and sharing my knowledge.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It was really blossomed into more of a community forum.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Became less about me and more about the viewers and more about the community.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It's for you.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And that branched over to john4lakers.com, which is a community forum.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's all 100% user-generated content where they can write about anything geeky.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Wow.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I like that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   How many people do you have participating in there?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Right now we have, I believe, over 100 writers from about 12 different countries.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That's really impressive.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That's amazing.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's a nice opportunity to give the people a voice.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Those that don't have many subscribers on YouTube,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   they can promote their own channels.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Well, we'll give you a chance to promote them.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   How about that?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Hey, thank you very much.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Joining us in a few minutes, John Gruber,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   let's see, Alex Lindsey is in transit.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We're going to, I don't know how much we're going to see of Alex over the next few weeks.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He's, he's going to Japan for six weeks to work on a movie.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So I think we may lose him.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Leo, I think, I think we've been joined by yourself.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Oh, you hear, you're hearing, you're hearing me?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   No wonder John kind of shut up.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   That actually, that is, that is me coming to you from John's site, John for Lakers technology.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Apologies.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'll stop that right now.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   We're mirroring you guys over there.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   That's weird.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's really a weird experience.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So let's, let's talk about the Mac.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   There's actually not that much to say.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   A lot of the stories today about the Macintosh, our stories about Macintosh competitors.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   For instance, it looks like the Blackberry Storm, which is Blackberry's real response to the iPhone,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   will come out sometime in the next week.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   They're saying maybe even November 17th, this is a rumor.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's a, but a rumor that comes out of kind of a strange, a provenance.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Larry Dignon reports it on his column between the lines on ZDNet.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He says, "In a conversation with Verizon's help desk on an unrelated issue, a customer
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   reps spilled the beans that that release date is November 17th."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He said, "Verizon has completed training with its tech support staff.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Monday will be the day for the storm."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And he says, "There's a lot of people waiting for this storm because they're ready to dump
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   their crappy smartphones."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Have you, now, Andy, I know you may be in the situation where you can't talk about it.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I'm not sure if you're under non-disclosure, but I'm sure you're waiting with interest.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Unfortunately, I can speak freely about the storm because I don't have a problem.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I'm in firefighter mode, unfortunately, where the PR company says, "We were wondering if
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   you would be available to speak to us at some point that we can't tell you about in the
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   future, about an unenized product."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But alarm bell will go off.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   You will jump into your pants, slide down a pole, and you're going to learn all about it.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It means that normally I don't really -- when my phone rings, like the actual phone rings,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I don't really pay much attention to it, but it means that if I see a number that I don't
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   immediately recognize, maybe I should actually pick it up just in case.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It might be the president telling me that it's going to be the Air Force version of the G4
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   landing at a metanurial field.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I should be at the Air Strip.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But I want to see something.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Who knows?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You don't know.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   The reason it's of interest to Apple uses, of course, is that Apple is finally, for the
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   first time, kind of beating RIM in the smartphone market, the iPhone now, the number two,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   smartphone.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And RIM doesn't like that too much.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So I expect the BlackBerry offensive will begin.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I mean, the bold is good, but too much of this -- too much like the previous editions of
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   the BlackBerry.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's the storm that's going to really give the iPhone a run for its money.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It really does look like it came to play.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Usually the signature feature of the BlackBerrys has been that big mechanical keyboard.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And this new model is going to have no physical keyboard whatsoever, but they have the
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   really interesting technology that could make the most realistic and life-like feeling virtual
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   keyboard ever.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Is it haptic?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's a technology that they call SurePress, which gives --
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   SurePress!
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Press!
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Press!
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Press!
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Never have a guy from Brooklyn named your technology for you.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Sure!
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Like I should care.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You got a press!
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah, that actually produces some sort of -- what seems like a tactile response, even though
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   it's just a flat glass keyboard.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   So it might possibly give this device every advantage of the iPhone's interface, meaning
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.720]   a keyboard that goes out of the way when you don't need it and also can turn into a really
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.760]   good panel of media controllers and game interfaces whenever it needs to, but also the advantage
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.240]   of the BlackBerry, because there are a lot of people who just simply will not use an iPhone
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   because they like having some sort of sensation underneath their fingertips when they press
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   these buttons.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.120]   John, have you seen one yet?
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   I have not seen one yet, but I believe they're using a combination of a resistive and capacitive
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.680]   screens to actually give the whole screen a big button feel.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.040]   So the capacitive screen is what the iPhone has, where it kind of senses your fingertip.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   Exactly.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.960]   I actually think it works by a transfer of electrons when you put your finger on the screen.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   That's how it registers.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.600]   That's why you can't use it with gloves.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   Right.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   Right.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.320]   So the capacitive is what most of the old Windows mobile phones use.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.720]   It creates, say, two thin layers.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.120]   When you press them together, that's how it registers.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   Interesting.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.080]   So there is this press that it doesn't have.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.400]   It's not like a MacBook, though, where you have the kind of clicking sensation of pressing.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   I think that's what they're saying it's going to be a bit.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   It does.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   It goes down a little bit.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.720]   I believe they're saying there'll be a capacitive screen on the top.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.160]   So when you just make a quick contact, it'll register a tap, but actually you'll be able
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.960]   to push in and use that resistive screen, which should make the whole entire phone feel
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   like a giant button.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.600]   I'm anxious to get my hands on one.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.560]   I'll be there in line first day.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   How?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.640]   I mean, you know, on the surface, that sounds good.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.680]   But now those of us who've bought these new MacBooks and MacBook Pros, I don't know if
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.600]   I'm thinking this is a great thing or not.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.800]   We're certain to hear some complaints about the clicking on the MacBook, the new MacBooks.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.640]   You know, I'm definitely in the minority.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   I bought a new MacBook.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   You like it?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   I love the new keyboard.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   And the new trackpad.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   I got used to it very quickly.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.680]   It's intuitive, but I find it doesn't register clicks.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.720]   It doesn't seem like it's registering clicks all the time.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   I use the tap thing frequently, so that it works okay for that.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.640]   Then some are complaining that they could tell it's on a slight angle because of the
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   rocker.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640]   I don't know.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   Maybe they were just babies.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   I don't know.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.040]   You know, I've been reading that on the forums too, and maybe I got lucky with one.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   Could also be.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.320]   Could be that there's some physical differences.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.240]   I haven't had any issues with it at all.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.360]   I went into the Apple Store and play around with the MacBook Pro.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.440]   And I think they found them both to be very easy to use and really intuitive.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.800]   I was clicking right where the old buttons used to be.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.080]   We'll see what Gruber has to say.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.800]   He's notoriously cranky.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.720]   It really is a psychological thing because again, as soon as I started to forget that
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   there's anything special about it, I got used to it a lot faster.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.680]   And now I'm using it pretty much as easily as my old one.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.240]   I guess I only get wrenched back when the click doesn't work.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   That's an issue.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.400]   But you don't have that happening where you write click or you click and it doesn't.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   No, no, no issues at all.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.160]   Maybe it's maybe it's maybe there is a difference that in the hardware.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.360]   Kevin Rose was complaining about it.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   That's the only that's what validated it for me.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.240]   At first I didn't I thought oh no, I'm not.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.640]   And then I thought, wait a minute.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah, I often click.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   It seems to happen with buttons.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.080]   I'll click a button and it doesn't it doesn't work.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.160]   Does it does this feel like glass to you at all?
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   I don't know.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.240]   Oh no, it's feels slick to me.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   Really?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.200]   But see, if you had and I think Andy, you said this, if you had one where it's worn where
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.160]   it's been worn in the past, we're thin, it doesn't feel like slicker than that.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.400]   No, well, that that's why I'm a little bit concerned about about how durable this thing
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   is going to be.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.440]   I mean, I'm looking at my Macbook right now and it looks like there's a little puddle
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.560]   of water in the middle of the trackpad where my thumb has been sliding over.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   That's the old one.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.720]   Yeah, that's that's the old one.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.920]   So when it doesn't feel like glasses, when I wrote the review, I did have to double check
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.760]   and make sure that I knew exactly what it was made of and what the coating was like.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.840]   Although I did get a phone call from Apple and you're always not worried, but you're
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.320]   always sort of on guard when you get a phone call from Apple, the day your review is published
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.400]   because they spotted something and someone basically, and they wanted to issue a tech
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.200]   note, so to speak.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.320]   Which I said that there was no anti-glare.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   I think it was how I phrased it.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.800]   I was talking about the additional glare on the screens of the new Macbooks, but how
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.480]   they they had a treatment on the old one that's not of the new one.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.440]   And they wanted me to know that there was that there's still a there's still a treatment
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   on the screen to cut down on the glare.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.800]   However, it would be not would not be accurate.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.600]   Although I didn't although Andy, I know you didn't say that, but it would be not accurate
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.960]   to say that there was no anti-glare treatment on the screen whatsoever.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.480]   So obviously this is an issue that they're kind of sensitive about at this point.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   Right.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   Right.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.760]   Speaking of sensitive, you know, they brought in an IBM executive, Mark Papermaster, to
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.320]   take over the iPod and iPhone job.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.680]   The guy who was doing it is, you know, I'm not sure whether he was fired.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.920]   It's the usual I want to spend more time with my family thing and he will be paid through
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.760]   at a thousand dollar a year consultant to Steve Jobs for the next few months.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.440]   But Mark Papermaster apparently had a non compete with IBM and a New York judge has told him,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.040]   eh, you're not going to work.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.880]   He had agreed not to work for a competitor within a year leaving his job.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.720]   By the way, those those kinds of contracts are illegal in California, apparently not
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.800]   so in New York State.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.960]   Which might be why Apple didn't know about it.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.720]   And then Apple has pulled his bio from the Apple website.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.360]   So there, I guess, I don't know what happens now.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.520]   Nobody's running nobody's running the iPhone iPod division.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.320]   Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know nothing about how business works.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.680]   So I don't have much to say, but I'll just say that if anybody wants to sue my bosses
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.320]   so that keep working a $300,000 non compete.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   Okay.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   I'm already doing that without being compensated.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.720]   I'll take the money.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.520]   Let's add John Gruber to the mix.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.560]   Hey, John.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.120]   And a definitely buzz filled the room.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.080]   John, I think you're either muted or I am.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.880]   Hello, John here.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   I can hear Leo.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.480]   Yeah, we can hear each other still, but Mr. Gruber now it's going to be confusing.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   I'll have to call him Gruber and you read and you're John.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   I hope that's okay with you.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   That'll work.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.880]   Hey, Gruber, we can't hear you Gruber.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.640]   And on the on the vice president either.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   What about the vice president?
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.000]   I was saying maybe he has no comment either.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.520]   He's just he's he's he's he's following the very wise.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.640]   Mr. Ed protocol, Mr. Ed should never speak unless he has something to say.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   Hello.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.000]   Well, we'll let John fix his audio and then I continue to John says on I chat that he is
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.440]   checking his microphone.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.680]   He's checking his mic.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.560]   The famous I am.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.680]   If there are too many if there are too many air molecules between the end of the USB connector
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.200]   and the USB port, there's your problem.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   Really?
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.520]   Yeah, because the thing needs to be plugged in.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.440]   So if there's like a good centimeter and fair, I don't know what it is about like atmospheric
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.640]   air that has that it's not very conductive.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.640]   Wow.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.560]   All this time I thought you could just put the plug near the laptop.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.400]   I'm googling for I do think there was a techno from Apple about this.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.080]   I'm sure I could find it.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.240]   Well, we'll see here what's going on.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.480]   I mean, we'll get them.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.040]   We'll get them back on in a minute and same simultaneously with that my Comcast connection
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   died.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.760]   So I no longer can see any of our our stories.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.600]   So it's one of those days here at the Twitter cottage.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.920]   You know, it's we have four different input, you know, bandwidth.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.400]   I have T1 for the video.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   So that continues.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.560]   I have DSL extremes exclusively for the DSL for the Skype so that that without always
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   continues.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.880]   But but Comcast has been kind of up and down this week.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800]   And you hear that the train whistle?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   Wow, they're doing a train by this is a big parade.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.360]   Yeah, you know, that's funny thing about that.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.800]   Many people will be killed as the trainers diverted to the parade route, but still there's
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.200]   there's no training in Petaloma.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.760]   So I don't know what that is, but you hear it every time in the Veterans Day parade that
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.480]   we will also hear plane flyovers a little later on, which should be a lot of fun.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.840]   Let me well, yeah, Aussie doesn't like it either.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.840]   My dog.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.000]   No, no, it's it's okay.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.880]   Once a year we get a train in Petaloma.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.600]   That's how Santa Claus gets here, Aussie.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Yeah, that's does it.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.760]   I'm going to bring in my own my own sound effects gear here.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.400]   What's that?
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.520]   I think it's a fire engine that's passing.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.680]   What are you here?
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.880]   No, you did this piloting the and who's piling that piloting that fire engine, but Jimmy
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.440]   Kagnay, you started it with the birds, but nobody believed were real.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.200]   So John has done has fallen off the map.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   He's probably going to go.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.160]   I'm sure he'll text you when he when he gets back on any word on a the MacBook Air.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.920]   It sounds like it might be a little bit delayed.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.240]   I know people were excited about that.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   It was supposed to come out.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.640]   What around now, right?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.920]   That's the last I heard.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.560]   And then now now there's some perhaps news that the air update will be delayed a little
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   bit.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   I'm not sure what they're waiting for.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.720]   It'd be nice if they could.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.760]   I guess there isn't going to be a mobile in the Halem part till later in 2009.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.840]   So it's not like they're going to put a processor in there.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.880]   Well, it kind of makes the thing that's that's making this so interesting for all of us is
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.800]   that big gap that work that that big two hour gap that we're expecting Steve Jobs to
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.400]   fill during the keynote in January.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.880]   And as soon as I heard about delays on the air, I'm thinking, ooh, they're waiting for
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   air number.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.160]   They're going to release air to January.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.040]   Yeah, they're trying to stall.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.960]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.560]   We know and many are new Mac mini.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   What do you think?
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.080]   God, they have to do something with it.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.840]   Doesn't it doesn't seem like they have to do something with a mini at this point.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   It's getting old.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.680]   And what about Jason Calicanis's absolute assertion that there was a new display with
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.120]   Apple TV built into it, a TV in effect from Apple.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.920]   Yeah, but that kind of that just doesn't feel like the sort of product that Apple would
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   make.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.080]   That's just guesswork on my part.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.840]   But you know what a big fan I am of thinking that Apple always has a really consistent cast
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.480]   of characters in mind for what they want to do.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.800]   And I just don't see them producing a consumer television.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:22.840]   I do see them creating a standard mount so that I'm mounting plate that you could screw
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.880]   onto the bottom of an Apple TV so that you could basically mount it on the back of any
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.560]   TV you happen to buy or even a mounting system that would work with Apple cinema display
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.080]   so that if you wanted to buy like a 24 inch or whatever inch cinema display and mount
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.120]   the mini on the back of it as though there were two there were single integrated component.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.400]   I could see that.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.320]   Aces makes a very nifty little windows machine that works that way.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.200]   It looks almost like a piece of car stereo equipment that's designed to go underneath
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   the seat or in a trunk.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.240]   It's just a very, very nondescript looking black box until you look at the side and you
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.520]   see the usual ports done on the back of it.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.880]   And then you ask, well, Jesus, this is just a prototype.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.920]   And you're told that, well, no, this is just your design.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.560]   This is a design so that you never see it.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.080]   It's designed so that it mounts on the back of any TV you want or any monitor you want
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.520]   to turn anything any screen that you have into essentially a very, very slick iMac
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520]   like screen.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   Wow.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.160]   That would be that would be a very cool thing.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   I have to say the new 24 is exciting to me as some as an owner of a Macbook Pro because
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.400]   I'd love to get that, you know, because it has all the connectors, including the the
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.320]   magsafe connector.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.240]   It's not a docking station, but it's close.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   I mean, it gives you that kind of you slide it in there and around it and under it and
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.040]   plug it all in and you just leave it there.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.160]   It is way on that is gorgeous too.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.440]   Yeah, well, I like those.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.680]   I mean, I have an I have one of the new iMacs, so I presume it's similar to the new iMac,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   right?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   I haven't seen it.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   Have you seen it yet, John?
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   I have a local Apple store.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.560]   I'm in Orange County, California.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.880]   I had them in last week.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.960]   So I was down there.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   I checking it out.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.240]   It really does look beautiful with the black around it.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   I think it's probably going to be what the next generation of iMacs will look like I
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.760]   would assume as well.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.960]   Are they selling them?
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.320]   They, I don't believe they're for sale yet.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.840]   They did have one out though.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   They were showing it.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.320]   I'm being demoed with a new Macbook Pro.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   They were showing it.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   Wow.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.080]   I completely agree with what you were saying before about Apple not making a consumer television.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.400]   I think it would just be killer for their business model to have to compete with the
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.200]   Visio and the discount brands.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.960]   Well, you've been right all along, Andy, in the sense that Apple is very, I think you
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.720]   have in your mind exactly right the model that Steve Jobs is working with, where we
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.840]   have a coherent line.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.920]   It makes sense.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.760]   It's this, it's this, it's this, it's unlike, you know, in this, in strong distinction to
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.200]   Windows and to PCs where there are a lot of SKUs and it's confusing to users, you know,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   it's very clear.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   You know, this is for the home.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   This is for the living room.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   This is for the office.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.680]   It just, it makes sense.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.000]   And so your position is it just wouldn't fit into that.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.520]   Again, you hear about an actor quitting the business to enter them to become a rock and
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.160]   roll singer and you're thinking, you know what, I just don't see great rock and roll
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.040]   coming from this person.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.600]   Similarly, you just don't think really true.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   It's really true.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.680]   You don't picture them making a TV set.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   I could possibly see them allow basically talking to Sony, talking to Pioneer, talking
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080]   to Samsung on these other manufacturers saying, you know what, you're already selling a high
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.320]   end plasma for $4,000.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.840]   What if you were to sell it for $4,050 and have it include like essentially an entire
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.400]   Apple TV built in?
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   Right.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.840]   I can see them doing that.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   That's very interesting.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.080]   Do you think there might ever be a hybrid Mac mini Apple TV?
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.400]   It seems like they've both been trending in a similar direction.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.680]   Yeah, because I use my mini essentially is, well, I have an Apple TV at home, but I use
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.400]   my mini here essentially as an Apple TV with the addition of something like the Elgato.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.960]   It's a great TV device.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.320]   I think this is this Apple really needs to jump on this opportunity before it gets away
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.560]   from them because there are even open source media center applications that are starting
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   to look really, really, very good as it is when people ask me, I have asked once or twice
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.040]   over the past couple of months if it's time to buy an Apple TV yet and I keep telling
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   them.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040]   But if you have an old MacBook, it almost makes a better app TV as a Mac that runs this extra
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   software.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.520]   No, my Apple TV is I'm happy with because I've used the, you know, the ATV and I've
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.560]   hacked it and I've got boxy on it and I can do things like watch streaming, you know,
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.720]   video from Hulu and stuff.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.280]   And that's what makes it better.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.120]   But the mini would do that without hacking.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.800]   And I do wonder if it's just a lifestyle thing.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.000]   I was at a friend's house and they have this really luscious like 50, 60 inch TV.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.040]   It's the sort of thing where the entire, it's like Mr. Rogers picture picture.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   It's, you know, it's where the magic happens.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.200]   The central is the center of the scene.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.920]   And we're just talking and throughout the, throughout the, throughout the two and a half
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.000]   hour conversation with drinks, occasionally we just pick up a remote to go look for a photo
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   that we saw on Flickr to underscore a point or change the music or look for something on
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.400]   iTunes was talking about the new Clone Wars, Clone Wars series on Cartoon Network.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:14.320]   That was probably the best like full featured infomercial for Apple TV because I guess
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.160]   the four of us were the sort of people that could have an Apple TV integrated into their
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.720]   lives.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.120]   But I'm not, what I, what I don't know yet is if this is the sort of thing that random
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.360]   Q person who is staying up 18 hours outside Best Buy on Black Friday, trying to save
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.040]   $400 on a thousand dollar flat screen TV.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.000]   If they're going to really appreciate having Apple TV functionality or if that's just super
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.280]   superfluous to them.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.400]   I hear the breathing of John Gruber.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Hello.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.000]   It's the, the daring fireballs flying out.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.520]   Quick, put on your class for bloke.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.720]   The guy who could not get his microphone to it.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.120]   Hey, John, it's great to have you John Gruber, of course, of daring fireball.net, the premier
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   Apple blogger.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.960]   You know, you've written a little bit about the paper master thing.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.240]   We were talking about that a little bit earlier.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.800]   What's going on there?
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.040]   Just it's a non compete.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   What is Apple going to do?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.280]   Who's running iPhone?
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.320]   I've been very interested.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.840]   I've been digging into this and haven't gotten much that I can publish it.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:22.640]   But I think it's pretty interesting, but I think it's also kind of old news.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.560]   I mean, the hard part is that once you get to the senior VP level at Apple, it's, it
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.360]   is seriously like cloak and dagger stuff.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.920]   I mean, those guys just do not talk.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.280]   So any, the best anybody can get, I think, is secondhand.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.600]   So why did Tony Fadel leave?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.440]   Is it just more time with his family?
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.200]   It doesn't sound like he was fired.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.920]   In fact, he's been, no, that's the most successful division at Apple.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.560]   No, but, and there's a big but.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.880]   So if you want like a black and white story, like did this guy do a good job or not?
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.040]   Clearly, the guy is a winner.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.160]   I mean, the guy's headed up the iPod division and they've made it gazillion dollars and
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.520]   remade the music industry.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:04.920]   So the guy absolutely is a winner, but here's the big but Tony Fadel.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.400]   How do you pronounce it Fadel?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.560]   Fadel, I don't know.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.240]   Fadel would not be a good pronunciation.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.560]   Yeah, I'd say Fadel.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:18.400]   Fadel is very much on the old side of the iPod division.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.320]   You know, the, the, what used to be the portal player, you know, embedded OS and then they
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:29.120]   got rid of them and whatever the, you know, all the non touch iPods, you know, run some
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.040]   sort of custom embedded OS.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.480]   So the story I've heard, and now again, this is like two degrees out.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   This is.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Oh, it's all right.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]   It's Mac break weekly.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.000]   You can gossip all you want.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.720]   Is that at the outset of the iPhone project, there was a division as to whether they should
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.640]   use OS 10 for it or use something more like the traditional, you know, what the iPod OS
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.560]   software and embedded operating system.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   Right.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.000]   And Fadel was on that side.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.760]   And the two guys on the other side, primarily the ones pushed spearheading, you know, using
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.200]   a stripped down version of OS 10 were Scott forestall and Bertrand.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.080]   Sir lay, you know, the senior VP of software engineering.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.640]   And that turned out to be the right decision, by the way, to put OS 10 in this thing.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.160]   Well, it almost seems like impossible to think of it as anything else.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.480]   I mean, it's so successful.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.360]   It's such an iconic device that you can't even think.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   I mean, obviously, if it would have gone the other way, it would have been, I think,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   a very different product.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.000]   It'd be a razor.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.360]   It probably would have been the thing that I, you know, it's certainly the thing I was
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.200]   expecting two years ago.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.560]   And iPod with additional phone capabilities.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   Exactly.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.560]   And iPod with a phone.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.160]   So Fadel was on the wrong side of that, ended up losing out on that.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.200]   And what he's been doing since then, I think the last, what I've heard is the last project
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:28:00.320]   that he led the engineering for was the just shipped latest iPod minis or iPod nano.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   So yeah, which are great devices.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.080]   They're going to, again, they're going to make a mint on them selling them for Christmas
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.680]   this year again.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.640]   But that's clearly, you know, that's sort of like being on the telegraph side of AT&T
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.080]   100 years ago.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   Right.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.920]   You want to be on the telephone side and, you know, Fadel's team has not been the team
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.040]   that's built the iPod touch.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.880]   That's like a byproduct of the iPhone.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.320]   The touch is really just a phone at the iPhone without the phone capability.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.720]   So I don't know that it's so much.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.040]   There does seem a, there does seem a rift now that you say it between the products.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   You know, in fact, people say the touch really isn't an iPod.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.840]   It shouldn't be calling iPod because it doesn't do a lot of the things the iPod does, like,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.480]   for instance, disk mode.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.440]   It's a totally different, you know, it's, it's to me, it's almost more different than,
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.800]   than the iPod shuffle.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.400]   I mean, even the iPod shuffle, it doesn't even have a screen seems more like an iPod than
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   any iPod.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.200]   That's a good time.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   You quote, you link to a Philip Elmer DeWitt's column and fortune on the chronology here
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:09.040]   in, in which the most interesting thing is that jobs made him made paper master in October
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.440]   and offer he can't refuse a quote once in a lifetime opportunity.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   This has been a good job.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.760]   It seems like it's odd that he didn't, and IBM tried hard to keep him offered him a substantial
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.480]   increase to persuade him to stay.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.320]   He must be a smart guy.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.600]   I don't really know much about him.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.200]   I mean, other than, you know, them, within what's been, you know, printed in, in the press,
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.440]   you know, it's just basic background and that he has a personal relationship.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.080]   He went to school with Bob Mansfield, you know, who's now leading the Mac hardware engineering
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.240]   team at Apple.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:50.760]   Cringley says very oddly that the whole thing was a MacGuffin, a subterfuge, a placeholder
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.120]   at paper master's position as head of the iPhone and iPod division until he can take
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.840]   the job for which he was really hired, which is to lead Apple's PA semi acquisition.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:06.200]   That's the, that is the fab that makes the, the power also semiconductor, the power efficient
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.680]   processors that are based by the way on power PC, the IBM power processors, which might
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.440]   be where the conflict of interest from IBM's point of view comes in and create a new family
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.680]   of processors optimized for a snow leopard and beyond.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.960]   Now Intel would be a little miffed to hear that as well, I imagine.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.560]   That seems to me a little hard, a little far-fetched.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.400]   Aren't we happy with the Intel?
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.320]   Well, I get the feeling.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.680]   I mean, it does seem like the PA semi stuff is about Apple building their own CPUs.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.600]   Now what they would use them for, who knows?
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.880]   I mean, maybe it's just an insurance policy that lets, you know, the more options the
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.240]   better, you know, that if, you know, Intel can make something better than what we're making
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:53.000]   great, but, you know, why not take a fight that the PA may be being for portable devices.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Right.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.360]   Not desktops though, or maybe, I don't know.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.840]   I mean, I look at Intel's roadmap.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.880]   I look at the Nahalim and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, my mouth is watering.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.640]   I say, I want this run in OS 10.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.520]   In absence of further information, I'm more inclined to believe that what's more obvious,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.920]   which is that if they've named him the head of, I don't know what the exact title is,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.120]   but handheld device engineering, iPods and iPhones.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   That's pretty much one of the most prestigious jobs in hardware engineering today, working
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.600]   at Apple as the head of handheld engineering.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.000]   It seems hard for me to believe that he's secretly got some other job as, as, you know,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.800]   that, you know, aside from iPods and iPhones, just doing semiconductor stuff.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.680]   It might be related to that.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.200]   His expertise on the power platform certainly plays into it, but.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.360]   Exactly.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.440]   It seems to me like the thing that Krenzly is describing, you know, let's just say a year
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.040]   from now, whenever this non compete with IBM is got to be over, you know, whether they
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.200]   can settle it in the meantime, which they probably will, but a year from now, when the
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.320]   year is up and he's clear and free no matter what, the job that Krenzly is describing to
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.400]   me seems almost like a step down from the title that they've named for him now.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   Right.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.760]   I mean, it's a very prestigious job.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.800]   The thing that I don't get about, I think Krenzly is like half right and as usual, half
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.520]   too dramatic because Krenzly seems to be having it both ways.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.760]   He, he, he, he loses the fact that Steve Jobs has, as an enormous ego.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   But then he also makes it sound as though he's incredibly insecure and that the reason he's
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.280]   Steve Jobs personally squeezed Fidel out is that he felt threatened by him and that he
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.640]   got too much fed up, Fidel got too much credit as the father of the iPod and he was threatened.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.040]   Well, Steve Jobs isn't threatened by anyone.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.200]   I mean, I think it through that his ego is huge, but I also think that it's that he's
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.800]   extremely secure in his job.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.200]   Along with that huge ego goes huge confidence.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.240]   I don't think any, I don't think he thinks anybody's a threat to him.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Right.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.400]   But if somebody were, it would, I mean, if that were the case, then he'd be squeezing
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.640]   Johnny Ive out too because Johnny Ive more people, certainly if he's far more famous
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.160]   than, than Tony Fidel.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.000]   People like us know who Tony Fidel is, but I didn't know who he was.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.920]   Well, you know, you hear this father of the iPod thing and, you know, but, but Johnny
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:19.480]   Ive is, is almost the second celebrity in Apple executive ranks.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:24.680]   No, I think there's far more people who think that Johnny Ive would be a replacement, you
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.840]   know, for Steve Jobs is like a product visionary to lead the company then, then, then, then
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   Fidel.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.240]   Well, and this is the wrong time for Steve to be forcing people out as he was forced
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.300]   out by John Scully many years ago.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.760]   This is where you keep your talent in place, especially given all the Wall Street worries
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.280]   about his own health.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.720]   So I'm, I'm still looking into it, but my, my, if I had to make a guess right now is
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.600]   what the ultimate story is, is I would say more that he was bored, you know, that he
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.320]   really, you know, not that he got forced out.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.120]   And again, it was the team he was leading is still very successful, but that he was on
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.520]   the wrong side of this, which way should the iPhone be built that hasn't had really a
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.800]   hand in the iPhone or the iPod touch.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   And that's clearly the future of the company.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.640]   And so I think he felt a little bit bored because what he was leading the A team and
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.880]   he didn't get moved, but his former A team is now the B team.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   Right.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.680]   Let's also talk about 2.2 for the iPhone.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   It's imminent.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   We're here seeing a lot of leaks.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.520]   And one of the things that really excites me, Andy and Aco is that we're seeing screenshots
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.840]   and I've talked to people who have been beta testing that show that there'll be downloads
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.800]   iPod podcast downloads in the new iPhone.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.160]   Yay.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   As you're listening to your Mac break weekly, for instance, you'll be able to push a button
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.520]   that says get more episodes.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.120]   That's, that's, that's very, very hot.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.880]   But I wonder, I think that with this release, everybody is going to suddenly be like sort
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.800]   of like, you mean there's been a five gigabyte cap on downloads all along?
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.640]   Yeah, you know, that's going to, that's going to rear exactly head, isn't it?
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.720]   Is it five or 10?
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.400]   Last I checked it was five.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.920]   And I've quickly dismissed it as being important because, you know, you can check to see how
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.280]   much data you've been pushing.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.960]   And the worst month I've ever had, I was just downloading like three and a half gigs.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:21.160]   So I mean, if so, I don't consider myself a light user of my iPhone, but if it became
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.800]   so easy to download podcasts that way, that, that sort of were to subvert iTunes, that
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.960]   would be a bad thing.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.840]   Because you certainly, you'd, you'd cripple the 3G network.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.040]   Also it would minimize Apple's importance, so Apple's amount of control over the experience.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.000]   But as far as I can see, you don't have any sort of an automatic download sort of thing.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.560]   You have to explicitly say, oh, I want to check for more podcasts and oh yes, please,
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.440]   definitely I need more cursor words and that would make sense though, because then you
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.520]   wouldn't be bit accidentally by having something be constantly downloaded in the background.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.840]   And suddenly at the end of the month you go, whoa, I've exceeded my cap.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.720]   It is interesting the idea of downloading 20 megs at a time into your phone.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.160]   That would be absolutely unprecedented for the iPhones for us.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   I know.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.040]   What else is new in two point?
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.680]   You, John Redinger, have you heard anything that you are excited about?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.160]   The future I'm most looking forward to is Google Street View.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.360]   Yeah, that's so cool, isn't it?
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.120]   I mean, the, the stalker in me is excited about it.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.760]   Who are you stalking?
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.520]   Justin, Justin Street View is very cool.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.960]   I had a chance to play around with it on the G1.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   Right.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.720]   And it really made it a enjoyable experience just to be able to look around and see where
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.800]   you are.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.240]   Also walking directions are going to be added, which for those folks in New York City or
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.960]   San Francisco can be a huge boon.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.600]   I like that idea a lot.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.640]   I'm wondering how useful it's going to be because remember that the iPhone doesn't have the
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.600]   built-in compass that the G that the Gphone has.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.120]   Oh, that's a, that's a good point.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.000]   I wonder if the accelerometer though can be, I don't know.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.040]   I mean, it will sense your turning.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.760]   I mean, it definitely, I mean, it definitely senses, you know, when, if you download a
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.320]   Google Earth, obviously it senses whether you're holding it up or holding it down and
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.360]   adjust its, its angle thusly.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.080]   But when I'm using the G1 phone, the coolest thing.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.240]   It knows where you're aiming.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   Exactly.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.120]   Just be able to turn around this way and then turn around that way and see the display
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   change.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.400]   Like, no, no, that way Nimbus.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.760]   You had it right the first time.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.120]   I think one of the features that's really going under the radar for 2.2 is Apple's
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   edition of the emoji icons for the Japanese market.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   Yes.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.360]   Must have apparently if you want to succeed in Japan.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.520]   That's, I hadn't heard that either.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.680]   And you know, the iPhone didn't really take off, I think, current expectations in Japan
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.040]   and supposedly it was because of the lack of emoji icons.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.840]   These are the kind of big icons that have all sorts of meaning and you use them in your
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.200]   instant messaging, I guess.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   Yes.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.360]   Or your texting, I guess it would be not instant messaging.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.000]   Yeah, I believe that's what there are.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Tons of pictures.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.760]   I was looking through the list of them and they have pictures of smiling and crying pandas
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.760]   and happy people.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.360]   It's very funny what they have in there.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.560]   But I guess it's important to that market and that's a big market for Apple.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.440]   John Grubber, do you think we're all going to start putting pandas in our text messages?
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.280]   I don't even need to smile.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.480]   You're the wrong guy to ask.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.280]   It'll definitely make Twitter a lot easier to use.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.920]   Here's my question with the podcasting and I'm getting a lot of email from readers who
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.240]   are seeing the rumors about 2.2 and that it has over the air podcast download, which
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   is great.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.160]   And I think once it's here, everybody will be like, I can't believe this wasn't here
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   all along.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.280]   We have this podcast listening device with Wi-Fi built in.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.880]   It took a year and a half to get over the air podcast downloads.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.080]   But here's the thing is everybody's emailing me saying, see, this is why they rejected
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.320]   that podcast rap two months ago.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.880]   And I still think, well, who cares?
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.400]   That still is no excuse for the poor guy who built the app.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.560]   Didn't, what are you supposed to do if you're an iPhone developer?
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.840]   Follow MacRumors.com and base your development decisions on rumors of upcoming features.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.400]   Yeah, I still say that Apple should have let that app in, you know, that just because
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:08.680]   it's coming to the built in iTunes, it still seems weird to me that they rejected that
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   guy's app.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.080]   Well, then there is a fairly large graveyard.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:20.720]   We talked about last week of iPhone apps that were either rejected or pulled.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.880]   You know, the G1 just got its first podcast downloading app.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.320]   G1 also has a bug that never appeared in the iPhone.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.200]   Mine just got patched this morning where you type reboot.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.800]   Have you seen if you type reboot anywhere on the G1?
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.160]   Have you tried that, Andy?
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.760]   I did it immediately and it reboots the phone because it's a crazy.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.000]   It really is the craziest bug I've ever heard.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   It's bizarre.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.880]   Apparently, it's a debug switch was left on and when the phone shipped and everything
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.960]   you type at the keyboard anywhere and anything is also sent to the Linux command line.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:01.520]   So if you type with privileges, so it doesn't even say you sure you want to reboot.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520]   There's other people online.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   Nothing.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   It reboots immediately.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   It's an instant reboot.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.840]   And I tried it and it worked.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.360]   Whenever you type in a credit card number, you for oddly enough a rice cooker arrives
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   at the later.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.440]   You see, that's the question is are they apparently they're logging these as well.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:23.520]   So I mean, I would say the upside of that bug though is that it's proof that Google's
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.960]   or Android, whoever you want to give credit to it that they're over the air update system
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   is working.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.600]   That you're saying your device got, you know, you just tried it off.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   Yes.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   And you just you didn't do anything.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   Nope.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.040]   In some ways, that's actually better than the iPhone.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.480]   The iPhone you've still got to be sinking with with.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.600]   That's a good point with iTunes regularly.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.560]   They were able to push that fixes the second fix I've received.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   But but that's true.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.360]   Isn't that more normal though in the cell phone world that you get these are maybe not?
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   I don't know.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.120]   I've heard that a lot of like with a lot of, I mean, and I'm not an expert.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.800]   Maybe somebody else is used blackberry more, but I've heard that with blackberry, you often,
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.840]   you know, sort of get stuck on it, whatever version it was at when you bought it and you
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.640]   better hope that well, it is true.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.120]   I guess on my Nokia that I had to go.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.560]   Nokia's you have to go to the Nokia site and get download an application for updating and
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   run it periodically.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.080]   And it's Windows only too, which is annoying.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.360]   I do wonder if that kind of behavior is really appropriate for mobile phone though.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.920]   You do get the devices like the Amazon Kindle that's technically a Linux device that can
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.280]   fix itself over the air.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.600]   But the Kindle is a static book reader.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.480]   It's not a computer that you own and that you feel as though you should need to control.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:43.320]   I mean, I like the fact that Apple pushes up updates when they're needed.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:49.960]   But I also like the fact that I can have a generation one iPhone with 1.2 firmware on
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.160]   it if I want to keep it that way.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.960]   It also makes me worry, you know, it has the ability to simply scan everything that's being
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   typed to run a very low level type of command that totally owns the phone.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:08.400]   Don't you think that there are a lot of there are a lot of no good nooks out there who decided
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.640]   to take three personal days in a row from the job of the time?
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.960]   I've got a new project.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.080]   I've got root access.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.200]   I don't have to work in the tires store anymore because I've just released a piece of software
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   that people don't know.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.720]   Yeah, you have a good point.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.360]   I was glad to see that.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.840]   But I was both happy that I could do it because I think it's just the funniest bug ever.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.720]   And then also very relieved when I turned on the phone that it downloaded the.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   I'm not used by the way.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.120]   I'm not using it as my full-time phone as I thought I might.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.920]   I went back to the iPhone and it's chiefly battery life, but it's also just the dearth
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.280]   of interesting applications.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.240]   There's some that are killer like the street view that uses the compass like the bar code
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.040]   scanning, which is something I've always wanted for the iPhone.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.680]   The ability to walk up to a product, launch this application, scan the barcode and be
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.720]   told where you can get it cheaper nearby.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.760]   That's a killer app and it works.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.400]   There's three of them.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Such a killer app.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.920]   Three people did them.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.200]   That's something that I apparently the iPhone's phone is not sufficient resolution and because
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.720]   it doesn't have that kind of auto focus feature.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.760]   I've heard that too.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.560]   The problem is that the iPhone camera is fixed focus and it's like I think like three feet
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   away from the lens or something like that is the focus point.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.600]   Yeah, you need to be able to get fairly close to fill that frame.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.880]   It's pretty easy to do with a G1.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.120]   I mean, you kind of have you played with an annual?
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   Which one, the G1?
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   The bar coding scanning.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   Yes, I have.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:44.840]   And yeah, that's with every really cool piece of technology, you need to have that one feature
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.400]   that you show people across the restaurant table that causes them to instantly want to
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.840]   buy this thing.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.680]   And the demo, I almost have to figure out, make sure you have a candy bar in your pocket.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.880]   Make sure you have a piece of something you recently book or something that has a barcode
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.240]   on it because I have people have heard about this and they want to see a demo of it and
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.000]   I've had, oh damn, I didn't buy anything today.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.920]   Carry stuff with barcodes at all times so that you can scan it.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   It is a wonderful feature.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.960]   And it does point out that, you know, if there's one feature that I really want to
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.920]   lobby for for the next generation of iPhone hardware, I want a better camera.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   Better camera.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Thank you.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.080]   Even three megapixels isn't enough.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   I want five.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.440]   I don't think the megapixels are megapixels.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.440]   What do you want, John?
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.640]   I was going to say I completely agree.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.080]   I think this is another example of living with the iPhone's limitations and being happy
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   with it.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   The iPhone 3G and that's my daily driver.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.520]   But still the things that most phones could do years ago, the iPhone still doesn't do.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.880]   I take pictures of my iPhone, but I kind of always wish I had better images.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.760]   John Gruber, do you think it needs something other than more megapixels?
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   Yeah, I think megapixels is the better image quality at the side.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:04.000]   I would much rather have a better lens, something with, say, autofocus so that you can get better
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:19.480]   than a
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:32.160]   camera.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.280]   To be fair, I find that the firmware, that's powering the camera in the Google phone, or
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.400]   rather, excuse me, in the G1 is more easily bamboozled in terms of exposure than the iPhone's
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   firmware is.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.800]   I take pictures the exact same scene, the exact same lighting situation.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.720]   There are a lot more blown highlights on the G1 than there is on the iPhone.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:46:02.640]   Of course, we're not talking about variable focus as opposed to autofocus.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   That's just such a huge difference.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:09.240]   When you're using a camera phone and you hear that little motor basically trying to zoom
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.360]   in on one specific area of the picture and make it better, it's clarity not making it
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   megapixels that really went out.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   Yeah, I have to do that.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.760]   The thing I always find myself wanting to do with my iPhone camera is take pictures of
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.240]   stuff real close to it, get almost like a macro mode.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.040]   It's almost like in the old James Bond pictures when it seemed so cool that he'd have a camera
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.520]   in his watch and he'd be taking pictures of the plans from Dr. Noah or whatever.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.560]   Just like somebody has a piece of paper or something and I just want to get a picture
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.040]   of it and then when I get back, then I'll have it, I'll have a...
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.000]   You know where it's really useful is with something like Evernote where you take the
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.920]   picture, you upload it to Evernote and then they have the...
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.440]   Yeah, well, it's humans type in the text.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.560]   That would be better in a way.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.840]   Barcode scanning, automatic character recognition, that's a tough one.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.280]   Actually, and the next step beyond that is to give developers access to the camera
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.680]   hearts because one button for taking a picture, it's a good button and it works and it takes
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.760]   the picture but there's such a thing as exposure and color contrast and auto timers and all
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.560]   kinds of cool stuff that this should be able to do that it's not doing.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.400]   There are some fun camera applications.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.760]   I use one called Camera Bag which is really fun and it gives you...
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.480]   You could take the picture but it gives you a choice of different old style cameras that
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.560]   it will process the photo as.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.120]   So I can choose from Helga, Lolo, Cinema, Ansel which does a kind of black and white
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:47.160]   effect, 1962 which is kind of like the Kodachrome effect, 1974, Fish Eye or Infrared.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.400]   I mean, it's kind of fun.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.880]   So what do you use for a camera application, Andy?
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.040]   Do you just use the built-in iPhone camera?
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.800]   Yeah, I just use the built-in camera because there are a couple of apps that do a fairly
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:07.480]   okay job of giving you like iPhoto 3.0 type editing functionality.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.320]   You can just sort of tweak the exposure a little bit, tweak the color a little bit.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:17.520]   But I find that if it is even halfway worth tweaking with it's already been shot it's worth
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.600]   just dumping it into the real iPhoto or the real Photoshop and enhancing it.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:30.360]   I mean, the game is already lost by the time the iPhone has guessed poorly at the exposure.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.760]   It's been bamboozled by the light coming in from the window and actually it was the thing
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   that was on the tabletop that you were interested in.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   I mean, you can make that brighter but it'll still look like a crappy under exposed picture.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.600]   John Gruberty, you use anything in particular to use the iPhone's camera app?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.680]   I just got the one you're talking about, Photobag.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.760]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   I just got that like a week ago.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.480]   I maybe don't even come out a week ago but I saw it somewhere else.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.760]   And it's funny because some of the effects actually, the same picture, it actually looks
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:04.120]   better, not just like in a gimmicky way but like because I think so many of the problems
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:12.760]   with the iPhone is wrong guesses at not the exposure, the color balance.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.520]   That the gimmicky filters like the fake Lomo effect, it actually makes the pictures look
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.800]   better, not just in a gimmicky way.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.840]   No, I completely agree with you.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.480]   I use the Helga a lot which is like wasn't that a Russian like a cheap plastic Russian
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   camera?
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.600]   It's really kind of fun and there's a pseudo infra red.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.640]   John Redinger, do you, first of all, I don't even know, are you an iPhone user?
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   I think you are, right?
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.520]   I am the iPhone 3G, the 16 or gig black is my daily phone.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.640]   And you know, I'm with Andy.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.440]   I use the built-in camera.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   I built in camera.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.360]   I always up the mind that if it's worth editing, I'll edit it on the computer.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:55.000]   I use a smug mug's application too because I like to upload stuff to smug mug and it
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.520]   geotags the image and stamps it and tags it and uploads it right to smug mug.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.080]   So that's kind of fun.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.280]   But I do, you know, I would, I like taking pictures.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.080]   I mean, Andy, you're a great photographer.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.120]   And I suppose you always have a good camera along with you.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.040]   But, see, that's just it.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.040]   The iPhone is the device that I take with me when I have no plans to ever need a computer
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.560]   or no plans to ever need electronic books with me or anything.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.440]   And as a result, the times when, oh, damn, this traffic here, there's a huge pile up on
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.760]   I-95 and I better just pull over and have dinner nearby.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.920]   So that's when I'm glad that I can, I have access to email on the web and all my ebooks.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.560]   The iPhone is also the camera that I have with me when I didn't think that I would need
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560]   to have a camera with me.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.280]   Now, I recently picked up Nikon's P6000 CoolPix and it's great to have a camera of that
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.560]   caliber that's that small.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.160]   And thanks to the glory and the majesty of my internet tactical pants, there's always
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.080]   there's always a, sorry, with me.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.720]   But again, there's so many times when I just want to make sure that the times when I see
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.680]   something just kind of cool and kind of funny, not something that I would ever, you know,
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.120]   good enough that I would publish anything with it or make a print out of it.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.880]   But just something funny that I just want to put on the blog or I just want to remember
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   it.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.720]   You know, I just want that little lens to be a good little piece of glass with variable
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.960]   focus and the ability to give it a little bit of human direction saying, oh, you actually
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   kind of blew that.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.240]   Here's, I'm going to give you some guidance.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.560]   Please underexpose that by one stop and try it again.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.440]   And that's the, I might be really well in the minority here because for a lot of people,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.160]   it's just the goofy camera that you just happen to get free with a phone.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:36.240]   But that would, that would be one of those little transformative new features of an iPhone
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   for me.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.040]   John Gruber, any other, any stories that are on your mind or you're, you're ready to write
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.880]   about on daring fireball that you want to share with us at this point.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.840]   And what are you working on these days?
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.640]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.920]   You don't have to, you don't have to has anything.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.280]   You sound like you've been beaten down by life.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   If there's a theme, a current theme, it's the idea that, that, you know, I wrote about
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:13.360]   it last week about sort of an ode to the built in iPhone notes app of, you know what I don't,
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.800]   I use, I haven't gotten around to finishing the saga yet.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.960]   I actually use an app called Right Room, which I think is like four or five bucks.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.760]   That's, is that hog-based software?
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:35.520]   And he's a new one that just came out this week called memos, M-E-M-O-S, which is similar
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.680]   in a lot of ways to Right Room does some of the same things, nice that notes doesn't
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   do.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:45.240]   But then it's, you know, the big question with all third party notes apps, the big unanswered
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.120]   feature that Apple doesn't provide is how do you sync notes, right?
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.320]   So memos is pretty cool.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.480]   It syncs to Google Docs.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   So interesting.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.840]   Google account, and then it just, you know, you can pick which ones you want to save.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.520]   It's not a seamless interface.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.720]   I could go on and on about that, but it works and it's not too bad.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.040]   And in terms of like, hey, I've got this text right here on my computer.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.480]   I want to put it in a note on my iPhone.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.160]   You can copy it, go to your Google Docs, make a new document, paste it in, and that's
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.240]   it, you know, and then you can go to your phone and just hit a button and it'll slurp
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   it down.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.520]   That's what I use Evernote for though.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.440]   I mean, you can type in Evernote and it'll sync.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.800]   So there's, you know, so there's a bunch of different options in there.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.840]   And Evernote is definitely very good software.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:36.280]   I've, my big gripe though on my Ode to notes is that while notes doesn't quite do enough
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.840]   and I don't, I really don't like that font, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to complain
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   about that.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.720]   There's, there's a beauty to the simplicity of the built in notes app in terms of how
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.320]   many taps it takes to do anything and just how little it does.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:54.840]   And it's just a perfect little like minimalist, just dash out your thoughts app.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   Right.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:02.000]   And I feel like there's a lot of, of what a lot of like little, little details that,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.120]   that just keep things as simple as possible that Apple does in their built in iPhone apps
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.480]   that, that a lot of third party developers don't seem to be getting.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   Right.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:22.120]   And, you know, and, and the analogy that I drew is sort of like how in like 1985 and 1986
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:27.960]   that, that people trying to write their first Mac software just couldn't shake the preconceptions
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:33.160]   they had from the command line era, you know, when, when before gooies that, that, you know,
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.400]   you'd download, you know, you'd go to your, your, your user group and with your floppy
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.680]   drive and get the new apps, you know, remember that's how you got shareware apps at the time.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.240]   And you'd, you know, get all the new ones and try them out and the, you know, and you'd
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.640]   be like, and you'd be like, oh man, this guy just doesn't get it, you know.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.200]   And I feel like that's the deal with a lot of the third party iPhone apps is that they're,
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:05.320]   they're like still trying to put like a Mac app on the iPhone, not quite getting how,
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.600]   how the iPhone is really sort of a different, right, gestalt than, than the Mac.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.320]   I think that's inevitable.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.880]   New platforms always struggle a little bit at first.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.760]   And I mean, if you believe that the iPhone is, is a new platform in the sense that it
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:26.120]   is the, you know, we're talking, we're moving into portable tablet computing, and it would
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.800]   make sense, especially with the pinch and the touch and all that.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.920]   This is really, there's new input methods.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.000]   I'm not surprised that people are having a hard time.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.880]   I think Evernote's a good example of that.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.320]   I think Evernote is terrific software, a great service.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.520]   You know, I love that it's got three different interfaces.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.360]   It's got the iPhone, it's got the Mac client, it's got a very nice web client.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.440]   But I think that it's still to me when I look at it on the iPhone, it looks like a Mac app
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.040]   shrunk to the iPhone where it's got a feel for title and you tap this field.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.160]   And whereas like Apple's Notes app that doesn't even have a title field, just the first line
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.080]   of text is the title of it.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.040]   And it doesn't even, it's not even a separate field.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:07.560]   Are there any third party apps that you like besides notes that you feel like or get it?
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:14.680]   My favorite and it's just such a beautiful little thing is peakalk.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.920]   I haven't played that.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.720]   There's peakalk, I mean, and I don't even need it.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.760]   I don't do that much math, but I just love the app.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:27.520]   But it's like imagine if like a great, I mean, it's exactly what it is.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.720]   It's written by James Thompson, you know, and it's the author of Drag Thing for the Mac
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:39.960]   and peakalk for the Mac, you know, long standing, excellent shareware calculator app.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.920]   Just imagine if like a really good developer with a great eye for design just spent like
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.360]   months and months just writing an iPhone calculator app.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.440]   And it's, you know, it's just so perfect.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.320]   It's just got so many little touches that like the Apple's built-in calculator doesn't
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   do.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:02.600]   Like for example, when you type, you're typing out the numbers on the keypad, you get the
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.440]   you know, when you're typing on the keyboard on the iPhone and every letter you press,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.680]   you get a pop up above your thumb that shows you what letter you just hit.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.800]   Peakalk does that with the numbers and buttons that you hit.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.040]   It just that's how it should work.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   Yeah, it's intuitive.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.360]   And just all sorts of little things that it does that once you see them, then you go
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.120]   back to Apple's calculator and you're like, Oh, they were so lazy on this.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   I've thought that for years.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.560]   In fact, I'm still waiting for Microsoft Windows to update their calculator since Windows
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   95.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.840]   I understand Windows 7 will update the calculator.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.360]   And he and I go, what's what do you like on the iPhone these days?
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:44.200]   Are there any apps that are catching this is this is not your pick.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.520]   This is this is pre pick.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:51.400]   They're probably they're probably going to be too.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.600]   I cannot get enough of stanza.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.760]   That's the book reader.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.000]   That's the book reader.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   And it's deaf.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.520]   It's just so totally in that category of, Oh, for God's sake, Apple just write the
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.800]   this guy a check, offer him a title, you know, get by this and just have this as part of
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.280]   the standard thing you get with the iPhone.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.940]   Because it is not any document that you have on your desktop.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:19.400]   It is an easy way to have a totally accessible and totally experienceable, for lack of a
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.520]   better word, on the iPhone.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.760]   It works on your desktop.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   It works.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.720]   It works on the on the iPhone.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.320]   Moving files is easy.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.880]   You can use commercial content.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.960]   It'll work with various bookstores, excuse me, online bookstores, not the Kindle store, of
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.400]   course, because that's still proprietary.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:42.000]   But there are non but there are other stores that are willing to do business.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.480]   It's the it's one of those things that just added when I when I spend more than 30 bucks
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:52.540]   on something sort of mentally I have it's like I've given Apple $300 on account for this
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.540]   device.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:58.720]   And every time it gives me something that improves my life or my work in any way, you
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.800]   know, I basically earns X dollars out of it.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:07.000]   And Stanza was worth about $40 of the price of the iPhone for me.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.760]   Because in terms of ways it opened it up, ways it let me just totally totally do things
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.280]   that I've always wanted to do with it, but wasn't able to do it.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.200]   It's just great stuff.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.360]   John Redinger, is there an app you'd like to nominate for the iPhone Hall of Fame?
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   Absolutely.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.960]   There are two that I really can't live without.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.000]   The first one I was able to grab for the 30 seconds it was up there, net share.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.160]   Yeah, you're lucky dog.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.400]   Man, I wish I thought to download that.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.440]   Man, I was so happy to grab that.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.400]   And that of course, let's you essentially tether your iPhone to your computer, cheat
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.800]   it as a wireless hotspot.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   And it still works.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.960]   I mean, I guess Apple could push something down to break it.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.720]   Yeah, you know, they definitely could have got that kill switch, but it still works,
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.240]   at least as of yesterday, fortunately.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.480]   And the next one that I love is just a cheap 99 cent app called TouchType.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.720]   And it lets you type emails and landscape.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   I use that too.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   Isn't that great?
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.080]   That is a fantastic.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.480]   It's like it must have.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   Absolutely.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.240]   It should have been built into the phone, but for a cheap application, it makes using
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.000]   the phone so much more enjoyable and so much easier and gets rid of the egregious spelling
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.520]   mistakes that I make normally.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520]   Right.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.200]   Now, Apple, you know what's weird for me is that when I first got my iPhone, I was
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.800]   on last summer, I found I did not have much handheld or like a BlackBerry type experience,
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.600]   so not much thumb typing experience.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.920]   And I was a Trocious iPhone type as took me the week to get used to it.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.800]   And I was much better in landscape mode.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.600]   And I thought, man, I wish all these other apps, you know, like notes and mail supported
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.840]   landscape mode.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.920]   But in that whole year before the app store, I spent so much time, you know, picking out
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.800]   emails and typing in notes that I've now gotten better.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:59.240]   I'm better at the little narrow vertical mode keyboard than I am at landscape mode.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.960]   You do a single thumb type or how do you know?
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]   Two thumbs.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   Two thumbs.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.120]   But I've sort of developed like the equivalent of like touch typing muscle memory where like
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.720]   I kind of know where my thumb has to go for a T.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.720]   Right.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.280]   And so I'm actually worse on landscape mode, even though the keys are better because I
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.600]   don't really have that memory.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   But I agree.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.880]   It definitely shows you that it just is crazy that Apple doesn't support the horizontal
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.960]   mode for mail because now there's all there's like a whole market in type your email in
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.560]   horizontal mode apps.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.960]   Is there a reason that Apple didn't include that with the recent firmware or any version
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   of the firmware?
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960]   I don't know.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.320]   I mean, I can only guess that it's that they just haven't gotten around to it, you
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.480]   know, that it's there's no real it's not like you can just like check a box in interface
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.800]   builder that says work in horizontal mode.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.600]   You've got to write code to resize everything and reposition everything on that.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.840]   I don't think it's you know, I don't think it's a tremendous amount of work, but it's
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.920]   enough that I guess they haven't done it.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.000]   It does seem like one of the things that third party developers are doing a better job
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   than Apple.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.960]   I see more third party apps that that that work in both modes than then Apple apps.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.760]   They'll get to it right after cut and paste right after cut and paste.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   And right before MMS.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   Oh, MMS.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.000]   Does anybody do we need MMS?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.720]   Is that something people miss?
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.600]   I think it's things that people would like to have not necessarily use on every other
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.400]   phone, but I guess you can just email.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.640]   I don't you know that that's what I do.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.960]   I think it's like a second card.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.240]   It's nice to have, but you can't really use that off.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240]   Cut and paste.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   I miss.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   I really miss cutting paste.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   You know what they've just added?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.680]   It's added today is orb.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:49.360]   So you can wife you're watching your if you have orb at home on your windows PC with media,
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.400]   then the orb streams it and you can then watch it on your your iPhone.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.840]   Anybody who's using orb will know what I'm talking about.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.280]   But that's a that's a big addition and effect kind of surprising.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.120]   That's the kind of thing I could see.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.440]   There's a free version of 10 bucks version.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.680]   I could see Apple saying, Oh, no, that competes with our own functionality.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.720]   Or anything else I could see Apple saying that clobbers the network.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.760]   Well, we're probably like, you know, they now that what they're doing is the stuff will
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.120]   only work on Wi-Fi.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.040]   I bet you in fact, that the podcast when we when we finally get to it, they may that
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.800]   may be the solution they do for the podcast application to make sure it only works on
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.440]   Wi-Fi.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   And that way you don't have to worry about this 10 gig or five gig limit.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   All right.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.280]   We're going to take a break.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   Get your software picks.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.400]   John, I didn't warn you about this, but we like to do a software hardware pick.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.640]   And if I'm sure given all the software you look at, you probably have something you'd
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.040]   like to give a plug for.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.240]   I am ready to go.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.080]   And John, both John's ready and Andy and I co ready.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.400]   But before we do that, time to talk about audible.com.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.480]   Those good folks at folks at Audible who support this show with their advertising dollars.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.000]   And I support them with my cash right back because I love audible.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.520]   I have been an audible subscriber since 2001.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.280]   I have downloaded almost 300 books now from audible.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:13.040]   And it's it's it's my little audio library, whether it's books, speeches, lectures, comedy
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.000]   club performances.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.040]   Audible has an amazing collection of over 50,000 titles.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.480]   Great stuff to listen to all the time.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.440]   I just talked to Roz.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.160]   She's a, you know, going to do her second stage of her row across the Pacific this summer.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.920]   She sent me the list of books she wants to listen to.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.920]   And that's the beauty of audible.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.720]   It's like it's like wandering through a great bookstore and finding stuff to listen to at
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720]   audible.com.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.200]   Andy, did you have an audible pick this week?
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.200]   If not, that's okay.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.400]   I just I know.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:48.120]   I just I have I have one that I sort of a sentimental pick that I haven't read yet.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.920]   As studs, Turkel passed away.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   Oh, that's right.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:59.480]   And he was I've it's it's weird because I was hoping that there would be a book, an audio
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:05.000]   book on audible where studs, Turkel is just telling stories because I heard him speak
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.440]   in person like three or four times.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.000]   And he just has this.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Yes.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.320]   Totally direct way of speaking that I obviously I think that his voice was very well suited
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.960]   to being in his 80s and 90s because it just gave extra warmth and extra color.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:32.680]   He was the most ground level writer and oral history collector that I think I've ever
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   experienced.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.640]   He just wanted to know what made people tick wanted to touch into that communal experience
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.240]   that everyone had.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:46.680]   He had this way of convince of explaining a simple explaining a complicated issue in
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.960]   ways that are so direct and so simple and so clear that you find yourself wondering why
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.800]   you ever were waffling on anyone subject.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.880]   He was giving he was having a talk.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:01.560]   He was talking for about an hour and a half of the art institute, Chicago, I think, and
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.960]   they start talking about unions because you know he was he was on the ground level during
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.720]   the struggle of labor unions in the twenties and thirties.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.440]   And he just said something that was just so emblematic of the sort of things that he
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.920]   puts into his books.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.960]   That's well, you know, let me ask you, we hear a lot of people who are against unions.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.240]   They don't think that unions are good things and they should be abolished.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.760]   Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.440]   Today, did he get to go home at five o'clock?
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   Yes.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.840]   Did you get the Saturday and Sunday off?
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   Yes.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.040]   Well, then you have the labor unions, the labor struggles of the early early in the 20th
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.560]   century to thank for that.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   Yep.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560]   Yep.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560]   Yep.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.080]   He was he was I loved working one of my favorite books of all time.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.520]   It just a so which which studs circle book would you like to recommend?
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.920]   Kind of by default his memoir Touch and Go, which is not narrated by studs, Turkel.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   Too bad.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   I know.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.040]   I do own the book, but I haven't read it yet.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.960]   And other people that have seen that have read it said that it's kind of hit or miss.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.280]   So I don't know whether to recommend I always like to be upfront about things I've actually
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.880]   read and whether I'm recommending it based on my own guidance.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880]   Thank you.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.200]   The good news is it's half price right now at Audible, I guess, be honest studs.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200]   Oh, God, I've actually been buying some.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.920]   It's like sometimes there's that one week little special and every single thing.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.720]   On my on my subscription, you get one credit a month though the way that the level that
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.160]   I've subscribed to and so many times like I finished the audiobook a week and half early
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.200]   and sort of itching for the next and when's the date that I get my next credit out?
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.960]   I've been sort of stockpiling audiobooks for those lean times.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   Yeah, I do.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.080]   I have a two book a month platinum because it's I just there's I don't listen to two books,
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.520]   but there's just too many books I want.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.240]   I'm one of those compulsive book buyers.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.560]   I have tons of books in my shelf and I have tons of books on my iPod.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.560]   You're going to love Audible.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   I'll tell you if you love reading listening is in some ways more fun.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.880]   When somebody like studs, Turkle who's an oral historian, they have a dramatization
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   of working.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:57.160]   I don't know how good it is, but I would love to listen to that studs, Turkle T E R K E
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.080]   L touch and go is his memoir passed away.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.800]   He was in his 90s.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.960]   He was yeah, he he he he he officially reached that age where you're like, okay, I guess
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.280]   he's never going to die then.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   Cool.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.320]   He was like George Burns and one of those guys who not only was in his 90s, but but just
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   as crystal clear and wonderful as ever and a great writer.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.520]   Oh, it's the only problem was I will tell this story because it's it's it's pretty funny
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.360]   and also, you know, kind of shows you how much people loved him, especially in Chicago.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.680]   I was a friend of mine was studs ride home after after that event.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.040]   And I had met studs at a conference like two months earlier and I was amazed that he remembered
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.120]   me and we had a nice little conversation.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.080]   And so we're like in the lobby after it.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.520]   And of course, everyone was gathered around and everybody wanted to talk to studs and,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.280]   you know, because again, absolutely beloved and I joke about being internationally beloved,
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   but nobody is as loved as was in Chicago.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.720]   And and so after about within the first 10 seconds of speaking to him, people say, I'm
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.560]   sorry, I'm deaf as opposed to you're gonna have to speak up.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.520]   And I don't know what it was, but there is something about either the tone of my voice
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:14.240]   or the timbre or my or the speed, which the rate which I was speaking that he could hear
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.160]   very, very clearly, especially like in the lobby of a theater where lots of people were
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160]   talking.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.560]   And so wound up as we're waiting for like the car to come around for 20 minutes, I wound
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.880]   up being studs, turtles, English and turp.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.040]   And I was I can't imagine what all these like dozens and dozens of people thought is
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.040]   a hey studs, my name is my name is Jerry.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.520]   And I just want to let you know that you wrote about a nurse in 1943.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   And she was my adder.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.880]   She was all thrilled and then studs, which I saw was like, no, it turned to me.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   And I would say his name is Jerry.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   I say like verbatim.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.480]   And I've always wondered what happened to her.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.040]   I was wondering if those people came away thinking that I was like Sven golly like psychiatrist.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.720]   Like studs, this fellow wants to speak to you.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.320]   Well, you have a booming voice, Eddie.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.320]   I think you probably do.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320]   And it is the timbre.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.960]   It is it can get like I'm not surprised.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.200]   He could hear it very well, because it's kind of a boss of voice.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.720]   He probably lost high end in the hearing.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.200]   That makes sense.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.280]   Touch and go a memoir of the great studs, Turkel, who passed away a couple of weeks ago.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.600]   And what is one of our greatest journalists, I think?
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   What a great pick.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.120]   Audible dot com slash Mac break.

[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.040]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.760]   It really is a great team made in heaven.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.400]   We're talking to them already about 2009 and they're on board.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.280]   They want to stay with it.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.680]   Stay with the team that brought them here.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.760]   And I like that dance with the one that brought you.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.160]   Let's get to our picks.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.520]   That was that was the audible pick.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.160]   I'm going to start off because I've got a little mini teeny pick.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160]   I actually have two.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.800]   One is that parallels four is now out.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.440]   So if you're a parallel, it's funny.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.960]   It's such a seesaw battle between parallels and VMware fusion.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.200]   I go back and forth.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.920]   I just upgraded to the latest VMware fusion three.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   Love it.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.920]   It's faster.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.120]   Supports the graphics.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.520]   You know, the the the the high end graphics processors.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.920]   In fact, it runs so nicely that I can actually run Vista on the new Mac break Mac Mac book
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.720]   Pro, which I really never could run at any reasonable speed before.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.520]   So it felt like parallels had fallen behind.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.640]   Of course, here they come with version 4.0.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.720]   So that would be I haven't downloaded it yet.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720]   Well, actually I've downloaded.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.000]   I haven't haven't tried it yet.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.400]   But it's a 39.99 upgrade.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.240]   They always do make big improvements.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.960]   I understand the DirectX 9 support now 3G 3 OpenGL, you know, 3D graphics support and
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   so forth.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:58.320]   So it's a it's a good it's nice to have these two fighting with each other because we we
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.200]   just seem to get great better and better products as a result.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.880]   You do get the feeling that that's a perfect example of consumers benefiting from a too
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.120]   great arch rival situation that that they're both better as of today than either one of
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.960]   them would be if if the other weren't around precisely, you know, and this is this is how
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   it should be.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.680]   This is Apple Microsoft, you know, AMD Intel.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.680]   This is how it should be.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.040]   And unfortunately, you know, these monopolistic companies really kind of kill this kind of
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   innovation.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.640]   You have parallels and and and VM where for fighting it out.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.680]   Keep up the hatred.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   Keep up the hatred.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.360]   No, I'm sure that they're there.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.880]   I mean, look at these guys probably know all know each other and it's great.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.360]   I think they just go back and forth.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.960]   So that's one pick VM parallels desktop for now just out today for the Macintosh, but
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.120]   I got to make a pick.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.400]   I stayed out of the favorite iPhone application because I wanted to save my pick.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.920]   I can't stop playing it.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.640]   I don't recommend it because if you start playing it, you're going to waste.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.240]   It's another it's 10 hours out of your life.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:09.160]   It's a little game called virtual villagers from Vivendi for the iPhone.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.080]   It is a 799 and I can't stop taking care of my little virtual villagers.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.200]   If you ever played populist or black and white, those games where you're God, you know, and
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.680]   you kind of run the village, it's like that.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.840]   Nothing really bad happens.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.200]   There's no fighting in it.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.280]   They're pretty peaceful little village.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.520]   But boy, is it a fun game and I just I cannot stop playing it.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.720]   And I've looked at they give you statistics after a while and I've and I've played this
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.520]   for six and a half hours.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.680]   My wife said, who are you emailing?
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.320]   I said, I'm just taking care of my village.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.400]   You have to make sure that they feed, they breed, they find new foods, they build huts,
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.760]   they invent things.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.840]   It's, you know, your typical kind of real time strategy game shrunk down to the iPhone,
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840]   but it is so much fun.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.480]   And any of any of you guys played this game yet?
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   I haven't.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.200]   I saw the screenshot and I was sort of thrown off by the little cartoon.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.800]   It's not it might not be your kind cup of tea, really.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.920]   I have a little I have they go to school.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.240]   You have to play the Tom Tom.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.000]   So they all assemble at school.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.720]   You have an idol that you have to pray to make sure that he's he's happy so that bad
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.160]   things don't happen to you.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.120]   There's there's about 50 mysteries on this.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.040]   It's not a very big space.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.280]   The other thing I like about it is it continues to run.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.440]   You could choose not to, but but but in its normal mode continues to run when it's shut
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.640]   down.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.920]   So you'll leave your village for a little while and you'll come back and the first time I did
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.280]   it, they were like five skeletons.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.280]   I had to bury.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280]   It wasn't.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.760]   You know, you don't want to leave them alone too much, you know, but of course the villagers
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.920]   are dig their own graves.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.920]   Yeah, they do.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   You have to bury them.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.160]   And there's a little graveyard, but I've only lost it's good.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.920]   That was it because I've only lost forever since I've been very careful to make sure that
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.600]   when I leave them, I leave them with enough food.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.360]   You got to leave them with a Cheerios so that they don't go hungry.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.160]   There's a little food to depot.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   They have farms.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.240]   They have mango trees to harvest.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.200]   It's really if you know what?
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.600]   I shouldn't recommend it because it's such a time waster.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.800]   There's no redeeming value whatsoever.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.080]   And maybe it's just me, but I find it intensely satisfying taking care of my little village.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.800]   Virtual villagers is from Vivendi mobile at Big Fish Games.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.480]   I think Vivendi distributed at Big Fish Games.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.920]   I wrote it.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   It is $7.99.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.080]   43.6 megabytes.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.920]   There's lots of the music is really pretty in it and stuff.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.760]   You know, it's just very soothing.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:35.040]   I do this like for the last three days, solid.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.520]   John, do you have a John Gruber?
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.680]   Let's I got to say last names.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   Do you have a pick for us?
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.600]   All right, I'm going to pick the Richard Solo 1800.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.520]   I got one of those in the mail.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.960]   I just got one too.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.520]   I had the Richard Solo, I guess they're calling it the 1200 now.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:56.120]   And what these are are external battery packs for iPhones and iPods.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.480]   It's just a little rectangular dingus that fits in your pocket.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.440]   It has a iPhone dock connector sticking out the top.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:11.600]   So you plug this thing into the wall and it charges this one, the Richard Solo 1800 stores
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   1800.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:19.440]   I think that they are, I'm not quite sure of the unit, but it's like milliamp hours, whatever
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.600]   it is.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.440]   Just know the numbers 1800.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.680]   The iPhone 3G's built in battery is supposedly 1400.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.720]   So this stores at least like more than the charts.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.320]   So you could take a fully charged iPhone, run it all the way down, plug this thing in
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.880]   and give it an hour or so and you have a fully charged iPhone again.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.480]   You can use the iPhone while it's plugged in.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.080]   So like if you're down in the red, you can just take this thing out of your other pocket,
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.200]   plug it in and you've got, you've got juice.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200]   And it's small.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.040]   I mean, it's pretty, it's easy to keep it in this coat pocket.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   It is pretty small.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   So I had the 1200 version and I've been using it for a couple of months and it's been great.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.800]   Most days, nine times out of 10, my iPhone has plenty of power at the end of the day
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.360]   because I'm at my desk all day long and I'm just using the iPhone here and there.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.680]   The days when I need it, when I'm traveling, when I'm at a conference, when I'm on vacation
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:21.800]   and on vacation means I'm just staring at mobile Safari all day long.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.120]   The iPhone runs out of power very, very quickly.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120]   When you're on it obsessively, it runs down.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.280]   This is fabulous.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.840]   I mean, and it's totally changed my conference going routine.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.760]   I don't carry my notebook with me even at a nerd conference.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.440]   I'll just take my iPhone and it is totally liberating.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.960]   I can still post it during Fireball through the web interface.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.040]   And with this external battery pack, it really, really extends the life of an iPhone through
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   the day.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.160]   So the Richard Solo 1800 is $70.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.680]   The other one I think is $50.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.560]   This one stores 50% more electricity.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.560]   And it's also what I would call it is like SkyMalk catalog optimized.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.720]   This thing is completely designed to be sold through SkyMalk.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.800]   Well, you know who Richard is?
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.840]   It's Richard Thalmeyer who started Sharper Image.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.920]   He knows how to market, that's for sure.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920]   Exactly.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.240]   He's sort of like what Rompopel is to the kitchen.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.760]   Richard Solo is to the gadget.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.480]   And it's totally needless.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.520]   I mean, there's absolutely no reason for it.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.680]   But it has a built-in flashlight.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.920]   That's somewhat useful, I guess.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.200]   And a laser pointer.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.880]   I mean, there's no reason for it.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.600]   But I have to admit, it is kind of cool.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.640]   And of course, I think they should just call it a frickin' laser.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.560]   Just go with the frickin' laser.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.120]   It's with a frickin' laser.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.960]   And with optional shark mount.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.760]   Exactly.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.000]   Why not build a laser onto it?
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.120]   But the other advantage, the big, I mean, I can't really say that there's ever gonna be
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.480]   a practical reason that I'm gonna be happy that I have the laser.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.160]   It's the father of a four-year-old, though.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.240]   It's not a bad distraction device.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.720]   Or for somebody who owns cats.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.720]   It would be useful.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720]   Right.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.200]   But it's totally pocketable.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.960]   Very lightweight.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:25.440]   And the other big advantage over the older model is that it uses the latching dock connector.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.320]   So when you connect it, you've got to squeeze these little buttons on the side to release
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   it.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.960]   You know how some iPhone cables you have to squeeze to get them out and others you just
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   pull.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.920]   The other one was pull, and if you put it in your pocket or whatever, it might come
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.360]   undone and you think your iPhone's charging, but it's not.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.240]   This one, it stays connected and charges.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.320]   Have you ever used the Mophie?
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   I have the Richard Solo, and I think I'll probably, I know I'll use it, but I'm wondering about
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.040]   the Mophie case, which is basically an external battery in an iPhone case.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   I've seen that, and that is the other model.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.960]   This is something that connects to the bottom and hangs off the bottom.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.920]   It's just not a case.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.920]   It's not a case.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.160]   The other thing that I think is a case with built-in battery power.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.680]   That doesn't appeal to me because I don't use an iPhone case.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:14.400]   I just, you know, I carry mine in the same facility that Steve Jobs does, the front pocket
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.400]   of a pair of Levi's.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.040]   Do we have left-turtle neck to John or just?
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:23.320]   No, but I, you know, but I do feel though that clearly the device was built for someone
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:28.240]   who carries it in a, you know, a pair of jeans, so why not use it that way?
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   Right, right, right.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.520]   The glass never gets scratched up in there.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.120]   I don't really care if the back does.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   So I don't use a case.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.040]   I like to keep it as thin as possible.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.560]   And the thing with the Mophie, if I used a case, I'd be very tempted by that, but it
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.720]   seems to me that when you're not actually, you don't need it, that seems like a big thing
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.920]   to have in your pocket.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.920]   Right.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.920]   The Mophie case.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:52.960]   Richard sent along the, a little, he calls it the flip case to work with the Richard solo
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   that I actually try.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   I've been using on my iPhone.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   It's very thin.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.080]   It's just, I guess to protect it from scratching and it might give it some protection if you
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.200]   dropped it.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.400]   I don't know if he sells that as well.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   Must he must sell it as well?
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.200]   Because it's a case that works with the Richard solo.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.480]   It was just like a piece of plastic basically that goes around the back of it.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.480]   You don't use a case at all.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.760]   I feel kind of weird about not having a case on it.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.240]   No, never use a case.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.920]   And it's not scratched up.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   No.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.440]   The back, you know, the back kind of is, but the glass is not, I don't put anything else
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.440]   in that pocket.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.560]   My right front pocket is for the iPhone and nothing else goes in.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560]   Your jeans pocket.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   Right.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.560]   Okay.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.160]   So we know what that bulge is from now on.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   Exactly.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.000]   I want to ask you a question.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   Guys, a question.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.080]   How do you feel about this sort of device versus a device like the APC Mobile Power
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:48.400]   Pack where it's essentially a battery pack that has a standard USB plug inside it.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.000]   So it will essentially charge up any device that can be powered off of a USB port.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.880]   I've always favored those devices because the because it'll charge anything or power
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.000]   anything that I have that powers off a USB, including my cameras, including just by anything
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   else.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.080]   Also, the way that I tend to use these things as power extenders is that I just have it
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:14.400]   inside my bag or inside a pocket plugged in and charging while I'm not using the device.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.200]   It looks it looks like the solar device is a lot cooler because it's optimized for the
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   iPhone.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.200]   It's a lot slicker.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.760]   No, you don't have to bring an iPhone cable with you.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:27.400]   I kind of like the extra flexibility of having a USB power port that will work with anything.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.760]   I can't think of anything else I carry where I would I need external USB power.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.800]   See, that would be the issue is it sounds like John, you're just you don't want to carry
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.880]   anything but the iPhone and your well, you know, I often have a camera with me, but I
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.240]   don't think any of my cameras charge over USB.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.640]   I'm not sure that that would actually charge the battery.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.680]   I guess it would depend what you it's depends what you want to charge what you what you
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680]   need.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.680]   Right.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.480]   Well, you carry Andy, you have like one of the I go systems or no, you said what did
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.320]   you say you said the I have the APC APC.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   That's right.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.800]   It's it's about the size of a classic iPod is and I'm not the sort of person who carries
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.160]   it in my pocket at all times.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.000]   Although again with my five one five eleven tactical Internet genes, I say you can carry
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.240]   anything.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:17.080]   My Chewbacca bandolier of technology.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.440]   It's more like I'm boarding a plane and I'll have my phone charge up during like the four
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.920]   hour flight and then like, you know, then when I arrive in Boston or arrive wherever
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.600]   I'm at, I'm fully charged.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.200]   Like I said, I just kind of like the extra flexibility, though, no flashlight, no laser
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   pointer.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.200]   So there you go.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.520]   I mean, I'm telling you, you want that man.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   You want that John Redinger, your pick of the week.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]   Yes.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.640]   And actually before I get to the pick while we were talking some of the big tech blogs put
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.480]   up a rumor that AT&T is actually getting ready to launch the iPhone tethering and I have
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.720]   some details on it.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.120]   Oh, tell us, tell us.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.120]   What are they saying that it'll run $30 a month and have a five gig cap.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.160]   And when you go over that five gig cap, it'll just cut off.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.480]   So it'll prevents supposedly huge overage charges.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:10.400]   But that's not that's still a better deal than buying one of those USB or PC card, you
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.600]   know, HSDPA dongles, which are those are expensive and you pay usually 60 bucks a month
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]   for that.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.600]   So that's not a bad deal.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   That's not a bad deal at all.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.400]   It's similar to what they offer for a blackberry as well.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   Okay.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   So that's interesting.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   So there you go.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.880]   That's why you that tethering application was yanked from the iPhone store.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   Yeah, I never thought that AT&T would agree to that, especially with all the.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.160]   Well, they're making money on it.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.040]   Yeah, I probably had a good 3G network, but I guess you're right.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.760]   When it comes down to the bottom line.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.800]   How fast, what is your guys experience with the AT&T 3G network?
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.120]   Does it does it seem as fast as other 3G networks to you?
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.120]   No.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.920]   Yeah, it doesn't to me, but maybe it's how many people are using it.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.600]   No, go ahead.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.360]   It definitely doesn't seem that fast to me at all.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.320]   Certainly I was fast as the commercials that they show.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.840]   No, God, those commercials are getting faster.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.240]   It seems like they're doing more faster in those commercials.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.440]   Yeah, they actually just started putting a little disclaimer on the new commercials saying
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.080]   it's been it's been sped up.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.080]   Thank you.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   Shake the urban spoon.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Everything goes right.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.080]   I'm fine.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   I don't buy that.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:21.440]   Has anybody done anything with I don't have a jailbroken phone or I guess you can't because
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.720]   nobody's got a there still isn't a sim unlock for three that iPhone 3G right?
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.360]   Nobody is using an iPhone 3G with T-Mobile.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   Right.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.360]   So it's hard to compare.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.480]   T-Mobile, I have, you know, I have a T-Mobile, you know, the G1 on T-Mobile and I can tell
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.960]   you right now, even the 3G speed is pretty bad.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.120]   It's sprinting Verizon the ones you want.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.560]   That's why the storm might be a real strong competitor, frankly.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:55.000]   I mean, twice now I've used the sprint EVDO modem on Amtrak and it's just it's like it's
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.560]   like having hotel broadband, which is not to say that it's great, but it's not the
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.160]   so you quickly don't feel as though you're using your phone system.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   Right.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.720]   Now, I don't think sprints in very good shape.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.400]   They've lost millions of customers, both to the iPhone and to other companies.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.760]   So I don't know how much what kind of state sprint is in the long run, but.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.800]   So Mr. Renninger, your pick.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.960]   Yes, sir.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.560]   You actually touched on my pick a little earlier in our conversation.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.040]   It's the boxy for the Apple TV.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.440]   Isn't it great?
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.720]   It is so fantastic.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.360]   I was a little skeptical to install a bootloader and essentially hack the Apple TV because
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.200]   I love it so much, but it really made it so much more usable.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.760]   Do you have to have the ATV from Apple Core to make this work?
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.840]   You know, I believe that you do.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.240]   And for those of you that out there that may not know what it is, essentially turned your
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   Apple TV into a true media streamer, let you stream any content, any file format, but
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.160]   the new killer features, the ability to stream Hulu onto your TV.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.160]   Ooh.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160]   Ooh.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160]   Which is unbelievable.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.840]   I'm a big TV guy and be able to watch that.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.920]   You know, watch Hulu from my couch is fantastic.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.240]   Well, I have the choice.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.320]   I can watch the new office episode on Hulu the day it comes out or I have to wait until
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.760]   iTunes releases it a day or two later.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.520]   And even though the quality is better on iTunes, half the time I'll end up, I just can't wait.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.720]   I want to see it.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.280]   So I can watch an unboxy.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280]   It's a no-brainer in the boxy.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.840]   It's so easy to install.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:35.080]   There are essentially you download a program, you plug in a USB flash drive, you hit install,
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.880]   and it formats that flash drive and you plug it into the USB port on your Apple TV.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.720]   Unplug it, plug it back in, wait a few minutes and you're good to go.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.880]   This is the Apple Core ATV and it's what, 40, but you could build your own from, it's
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   patch stick basically.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.240]   So you could build your own if you feel handy, but I think for me it's absolutely worth,
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.040]   it was absolutely worth the 40 or 50 bucks I paid for it and you get free updates for
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.880]   a year and that's worth it too because they're constantly updating the software.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.880]   The current version is 3.3.4.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.240]   Now you also have to have a boxy account.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.360]   Yes, and that's the one thing to mention.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.120]   It's currently in a closed alpha.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.400]   So you have to actually have an invitation from somebody.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.800]   And they're relatively easy to get.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.640]   You can send boxy an email and they'll usually approve you.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.640]   Oh really?
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.640]   Oh, that's good to know.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.080]   And if you know anybody that's using boxy, they can send you an invite.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.320]   Nobody here is using it.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   Are they Andy?
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320]   Ahhh.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   Naa-dahs.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.320]   I, yeah.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.720]   And that's what I was talking about when I said that if Apple doesn't really jump on
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:46.320]   this bandwagon, I mean boxy just turns any Macintosh into something that will kick Apple
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.520]   TV's butt up and down in the schoolyard.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.080]   It's basically a rewrite of the Xbox Media Center app which we've been talking about
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.080]   also.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:58.640]   But it looks like professional designers decided to make this as a consumer item.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.240]   No neck beard, you know, open source hippies.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.560]   So why would you want to have them in your menu?
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.200]   Well also you get a sense of a ton of content being available because they have, they just
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.200]   kind of make everything available to you.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.200]   Just browsing Hulu alone, this page after page of TV shows.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.880]   And don't end the sun overlook the fact that it does a really good job of discovering content
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.600]   that's local on your hard drive.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.160]   So most of your iTunes library is going to be available.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.480]   Well, most of your photo library is going to be available.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.960]   Obviously DRM content is a no go but you've been trying to avoid getting DRM content to
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:30.960]   begin with.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.960]   Right.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.960]   Absolutely.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.080]   And one thing to note is you don't lose any of your original functionality for Apple TV.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.520]   Everything works just the way it did before.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.960]   It's just adding things to it.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.240]   There's more menu items.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.880]   Yeah, which is great.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   Every time I turn it on, you'll see something new.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.120]   I think the added Comedy Central, CBS is up there.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.320]   It's pretty cool.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.360]   It's a great social networking tool too.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:53.240]   You can have friends that can follow you and you can follow friends.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.960]   You can get recommendations.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.040]   What's your handle on Boxy?
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.040]   John for Lakers.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.040]   Okay.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.560]   Well, if some guy named Leo LePort starts following you and you'll know why or Andy
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.760]   and I co or Alex Renzi or right back at you guys.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.480]   We can share our opinions on the office.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.440]   John, do you have a do you have your Apple TV hack yet?
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440]   No, I do not.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440]   Mine is pristine.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.800]   Yeah, it's not virgin state.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   But I've never I've never seen anything that really tempted me before.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.560]   Hulu is is tempting.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.560]   It's very tempting.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.520]   The other thing that you can do, it takes additional hacking.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.280]   You have to download an OS 10 package from Apple.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.040]   You can make it the Apple TV, see a USB drive.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.720]   So this has been rumored.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:37.200]   There are people on the Mac break weekly team who have a Drobo hooked up to it.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   Terabyte of content.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.000]   But you know, it's the old, you know, necessity is the motherhood of invention.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   Yeah, I'm not going to invent anything, but eventually I'm going to need to and I have
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.440]   the 160 gig Apple TV and I think it's up to like 120 gigs of content.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:58.720]   And I know that the, you know, that the Mac that it's slave to will start guessing which,
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.560]   you know, which stuff is to keep.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.040]   But the other thing is with a again, with a four, almost five year old in the house,
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.760]   God forbid the one movie that he wants to watch today isn't one that's already on, you
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.360]   know, so yeah, hooking up a Drobo to the back of Apple TV, which should be.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:17.160]   You just copy, you have to copy the stuff off the Apple TV.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.960]   It doesn't sit, you know, the iTunes won't sink to the Drobo.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   Right.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.480]   It's just 16 is external storage, but then there's a Nido TV.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.880]   There's a DVD player program.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.160]   It's just as DVD in the menu and it can browse that folder.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.640]   And so you can play anything out of there.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:38.560]   So I just weird overall though that there's so much hacking going on with the Apple TV
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.400]   and it, you know, and it just doesn't seem like Apple's got got the pedal to the metal
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400]   on that.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   On that device.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.760]   I'm wondering if all this hacking can happen because Apple absolutely doesn't care what
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.080]   happens to the Apple TV.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:56.520]   It's just such a non entity or whether it's because they're just using this development
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.720]   community as sort of the skunk works for what direction should this device go in.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.600]   I mean, I think I think that's flattering to Apple to think that they would do something
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.800]   that clever and that productive with Apple TV.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.640]   But man, I mean, Steve's always said it's a hobby.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.000]   He says Apple TV is still a hobby for us.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.760]   I mean, literally, that's the word he's used.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.480]   Yeah, I think it's.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:24.840]   I wish Apple would create an RC helicopter because I would.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.880]   I think it's because people don't quite or like the Wall Street analyst types don't
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:34.400]   quite get that it's, I guess, you know, clearly, no matter what you think of it, it's a long
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.920]   term play.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.000]   It's not a dud, but it's not a hit.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.480]   And so people don't know what to make of it.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.080]   So they just call it a hobby to get them off their case about making got the money from
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.720]   it because it's not like that because the thing when people disparage it as well, it's
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.880]   a flop.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:55.760]   It's not like there's some other competing device that it's losing to.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.320]   It's that this whole field is just still it hasn't hit the mainstream yet.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   I don't know.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:10.920]   The beauty of the music scene back in 2001 when the iPod hit was that everybody had unified
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:18.880]   on MP3 files and it was there and all Apple had to do was get MP3 decoding working and
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.800]   they could make a device.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.200]   They could just do the rest.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.480]   They didn't need anybody's help.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.840]   They could just all we need is MP3 decoders will do the rest and boom.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.080]   Here's your iPod.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.320]   Whereas now it's also split and fractured with all these different flash formats.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.280]   There's a lot of good non DRM content out there.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.360]   I mean, and they've got the thing with YouTube and so the Apple TV is pretty good for that.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.200]   But there's Hulu and all these other great stuff.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.040]   But they can't get there's no unifying.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.800]   Here's the only thing we need to decode and then we'll do the rest to sort of take anything
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.800]   you can throw at it.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.120]   I mean, that's the holy grail is that there's all this great content and that's what these
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.560]   hacks are like what we're talking about here.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:13.080]   It's all about letting it you use the Apple TV to view all this great content out there.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:18.840]   And there's just too much federation on the part of the entertainment industry.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.400]   You know, the NBC's behind Hulu and CBS is so and so.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.000]   Well, that's why these programs like Boxy just are great.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.960]   I mean, they just make it a multimedia device.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.960]   It's the future.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.120]   It's just a little geeky still.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120]   And that's the question.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.720]   In fact, you know, Microsoft's were trying to get in this business for a long time with
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.080]   Xbox and its media center.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.400]   I mean, they're very aggressive about this.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.720]   And they too say we're not, you know, they will they said our 10 year investment in the
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.320]   Xbox is so great, we could never recoup it.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.920]   You know, we'll always if you look at the R&D cost, it will always be a money loop.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.920]   Money will lose.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.400]   Oh, all right then.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.160]   So they too admit it, but at the same time, it's a very important place to be.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.400]   I wish I could run a business like that.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.400]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.400]   You know, it helps that you have a business that makes you five or six billion dollars
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.560]   a quarter this Windows thing.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.400]   You know, it helps to have that.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   And run so much beer that I will never be sober again.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.800]   So from there, so there.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.840]   All right, time for that's a good pick.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.480]   I think Boxy is an excellent pick.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.880]   You have to get the Apple core LLC.com, ATV to install it.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.400]   All worth it though, a great a great device.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.880]   It really makes it easy to hack your Apple TV.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.640]   And now on to and oh, and Boxy will run on your app.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.720]   We should say you don't have to have it on an Apple TV.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.360]   You could put it on your Apple computer as well.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.560]   And it runs very nicely on a mini or a lap.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.760]   I run it on my laptop.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.040]   It really does make the MacBook into a great hotel TV.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.120]   Yeah, I show you what we shouldn't say.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.880]   It's only Apple TV.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.200]   And I coach your turn, my friend, to make a pick.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.640]   I'm going to call an audible a little bit here
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.080]   because we talked about something
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.640]   that I was going to pick next week about the camera
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.960]   on the iPhone.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.280]   There is a really cool little attachment
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.440]   that Griffin Technologies makes.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:12.000]   It's called the Clarify CLARIFI.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.920]   It is a what looks like a standard rubberized iPhone case.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.880]   But you turn it over and you find
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.120]   that there is a little sliding door above the camera lens.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.200]   And you can slide in a close-up lens or slide it off.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:28.560]   But you're kidding.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.080]   And so if you go to griventechnology.com,
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.760]   I think I sent you guys the link.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.400]   You can actually see before and after pictures.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.560]   It does two cool things.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.200]   Both of them, of course, regarding two close focusing.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.240]   Number one, if you go to Flickr and look for the Clarify CLARIFI,
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.600]   again, the way it's the weird way it's spelled,
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.400]   for pool photos, they have a really nice collection
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.400]   of close-up photos taken with the Clarify
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.400]   that really sort of show you what some versatility
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.120]   can do for a camera phone lens.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.160]   Some of these pictures are actually very, very pretty.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.480]   But it also will hopefully give you
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.280]   some of that barcode reader reading functions
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.240]   from the G1 on the iPhone.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.040]   It can definitely focus close enough
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.760]   to adequately get a standard UPC code.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.520]   And it's sort of--
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.560]   I believe they've had some sort of a loose partnership
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.440]   with a system called Snapper.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.440]   S. God.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440]   Remember when we all knew how things were spelled?
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.680]   No vowels, right?
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.600]   S-N-A-P-P-R.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   Of course not.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.720]   Why would it have a vowel?
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.960]   And it's an iPhone app that works better--
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.280]   that will take pictures of barcodes.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.120]   Obviously, it works better when you have that close-up lens
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.560]   put on.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.080]   But it works in sort of the same way
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.760]   as the relevant app for the G1.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.520]   And that will get the barcode.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.840]   It will do a search to find out what product that is.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.160]   And then let you save that product information for later
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.280]   or looking up online.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.680]   So do you use this a lot?
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.920]   I mean, is this do what you want it to do?
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.560]   Well, that's why I'm calling it audible.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.440]   I saw it-- if someone had it at a dinner party,
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.720]   I was at last week and showed it to me.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.840]   And I thought it would-- because I'm one of these people
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.600]   who, again, if I were practicing Catholic,
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.120]   I would say prayers before I eat.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.400]   Instead, I'd take pictures of this wonderful looking piece
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:16.960]   of--
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.200]   wonderfully looking entree.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.160]   And so, well, geez, I got that you should--
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.560]   You mean, while everybody's saying grace,
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.120]   you're snapping pictures of the food.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.680]   The people that I tend to go out to dinner with tend
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.520]   and come to their understanding of the universe
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.200]   from whichever direction makes the most sense to them.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.000]   However, they're barely a bowing of hand.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.800]   Barely.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.480]   But enough-- just enough time for you
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.600]   to get a picture of the Castolei.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.040]   Exactly.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.640]   No, believe me.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.360]   The greatest compliment I've ever received
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.240]   about any of my photography is related
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.320]   to a photo of a stack of pancakes
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.960]   that I shot at a diner in Watertown about three years ago.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:04.040]   And in one sentence, somebody described their physical reaction
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:04.920]   to that picture.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.160]   And I can't repeat it or else it would
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.200]   call for the explicit tag for this podcast.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.680]   But I was very, very proud to have inspired
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.480]   that kind of reaction.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.440]   Handcake's so good they're arousing.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.360]   Exactly.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.520]   Clarify is $34.99.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.120]   It guesses kind of like having an add-on macro lens,
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:26.960]   kind of, I guess.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.320]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.040]   Like I said, I'm calling an audible.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.440]   Usually, I don't like to recommend things
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.160]   that I haven't tried myself.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.520]   So when I got back from dinner, I fired off an email
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.480]   to see if I get one just to start playing with.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.600]   I haven't received it yet.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.680]   But I have seen pictures that have been shot with it.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.240]   I have used it.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.640]   And I mean, there's nothing to install on the iPhone.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.240]   It's just a slide-on lens.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.480]   When you're not using it as an accessory lens,
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.600]   it's just part of the case.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.400]   It slides out of the way.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.360]   You don't have to really care about it.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.560]   And it might be-- if you're the type of person
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.760]   who likes taking pictures or if you want
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.800]   to use that cool barcode feature,
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.480]   then that might be something to take a look at.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:02.640]   Right?
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.520]   $34.99.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.360]   It's not terribly expensive.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:05.840]   No.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.920]   And it looks like a decent case, too.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.760]   But I think Griffin makes such good stuff.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.360]   I'd be willing to buy it.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.960]   What I would love to see, though,
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960]   I'd love to see them take this one step further.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.360]   I'd like to see them have a clarify that has actually
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.080]   two different lenses in it.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.160]   One being the close-up lens, the other being
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.280]   a neutral density filter that would just
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.920]   knock down the exposure by one stop.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.800]   I'd give them $50 for that case.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.400]   Well, if this sells well, maybe.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.640]   C-L-A-R-I-F-I, but you get it from griffandtechnologies.com.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.080]   And if you search Flickr for C--
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.080]   Pardon me?
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.240]   Technology.com.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.560]   Technology, I'm sorry.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.720]   .com.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.360]   I've been talking three times.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.040]   I never get it right.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.360]   I just Google Griffin, frankly.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.280]   Who types in URLs anymore?
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.120]   And if you use Clarify as a tag on Flickr,
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.000]   I guess there's some Clarify photos you can look at.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.240]   C-L-A-R-I-F-I.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.280]   Just the picture I'm seeing on the griffand side,
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.840]   that seems to make a big difference.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.200]   What's good?
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.600]   Well, I think we've come to the end of our broadcast
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.080]   day.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.040]   And now the tone, the American flag,
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:10.520]   and the national anthem will signal a--
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:11.200]   no, no, that's it.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:11.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.960]   Wrong broadcast day.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.000]   Thank you, John Gruber, for dialing in on us.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.800]   I'd love to have you come back.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.560]   Always a pleasure.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.960]   You're the greatest.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.880]   Also, John, and John Reddinger, so nice to meet you.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.760]   Gruber, by the way, Gruber's site is daringfireball.net.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.480]   Let's not forget that.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.560]   And John Reddinger's site is John, the number four,
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.240]   Lakers.com.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.240]   John, four, Lakers.com.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.320]   You catch a lot of his videos, all of his videos,
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.040]   on his special YouTube channel.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.840]   John, I'd love to have you back, too.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.160]   Thank you.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:41.920]   It was great to be here.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.720]   I would love to come back.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.240]   Nice to find new Mac geeks out there.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:45.600]   Of course.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.480]   Leave me where we're growing in numbers.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.560]   Yeah, I can tell.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.800]   It's a good feeling.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.320]   Andy Inaco, you just remember, you spell his name.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.200]   I have no ATKO.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:00.320]   I have no ATKO.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.840]   I have an adco.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.880]   I have an adco.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.320]   CWOB.com is a celestial waste of bandwidth,
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.360]   of course, the Chicago Sun times as well.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:09.880]   Thank you all.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.560]   It's great to talk to you.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.200]   Happy Veterans Day again, once again to all of you.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.680]   Thank you for those of you who have served for your service.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.800]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.800]   We'll see you next time on another Mac break.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.720]   This is broke.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
