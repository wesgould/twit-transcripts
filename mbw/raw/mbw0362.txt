[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300]   news and Apple news and all that stuff in your Google glass
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.800]   if we throw it in, that's okay too.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   Here's Andy Inatko, who is not wearing glass,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   but does have three strange people behind him.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   No, I was at the Boston Comic Con last weekend.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   Lots of great pictures coming out of you from Comic Con last weekend.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   Oh, and the Boston Comic Con gets bigger and better every year.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.200]   But this is so most one of my goals, like a Comic Con,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   is to get like great pictures of people in costume.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600]   And I was outside getting some fresh air.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300]   And when you see three people in blue face makeup
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.600]   and they're sitting, they're relaxing, they're just chilling out.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.000]   But you see that, oh, there's a blue background.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   They look great in front of.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   I have to sit here, I have to stand here and nonchalantly finish my soda
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.400]   and hope that they get up at some point because as soon as they get up,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.600]   I kind of have them pose them.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.700]   That's a great photographer.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.000]   Somebody who waits for the perfect shot.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.400]   Well, a great photographer would say,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.100]   "Excuse me, I want you to get up right now and on my convenience and my schedule
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   and do exactly my bedding so I could take you a picture
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.000]   and then take you, because you're on a public sidewalk,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.100]   I don't need a model at least and I can do whatever I want with it."
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.500]   Can I ask though, being not being of the Otaku variety,
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   is the blue signifying something?
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.700]   Are they Avatar or something?
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.900]   The blue and the candy corn horn signify that they are representing
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.200]   some form of anime character that I recognize on site
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.300]   but I have no idea who exactly they are.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.500]   I don't get it at all.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.800]   Cosplays.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.100]   I have total respect for it because there's like five different categories
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000]   of cosplay at cons since I have almost no familiarity with anime.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.800]   There's like maybe the eight characters I recognize.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.400]   Oh, it's the guy with the white spiky hair that carries the enormous key.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.500]   That's three feet long and one feet high.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.300]   Oh, no, it's the lady with the bridal veil,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.000]   but the tuxedo bottom part and the tutu and the giraffe who've shoes
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.800]   that I've seen all the time.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   But I shouldn't.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100]   That's a distinctive look that I should be able to attach them.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.100]   So, John says his neighbor, Amber, is into home stock and says,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.100]   that's stuck, home stock, but then Patrick, who is in fact cosplaying right now,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   says it's not.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.100]   So, I don't know.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.100]   We have a choice between that that I selected for today and...
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.100]   It is home stock.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.100]   Okay.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100]   Or...
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.100]   The Tuscan Raiders.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100]   I got the green lady.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100]   Oh, wow. That's Jabba the Hutt.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100]   Is that somebody dressed as Jabba the Hutt?
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.600]   That is a like several person.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Come on.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   Zoom out.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   You're being mean.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   While Andy's zooming out, let's just say hi,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   cos poor Renee's sitting there quietly.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Renee Richie is also here.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   What the hell?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   You got a giant Twitter behind you.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200]   Yeah, that's Ollie, the Twitterific bird, and the very first edition of
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.600]   Twitterific back when it was still jailbreak.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   Ah, the good days.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Hello, gentlemen.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Mac Break Weekly on the air.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Andy still...
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   Oh, now he's zoomed out.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   Wow, that's pretty serious, those guys.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Yeah, they're really wonderful.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.100]   They're a 500-first legion, and they also teamed up with their counterparts on the
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.600]   Sith side to do like charities.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   At this event, they normally have different like cadres at Boss and Comic-Con, but it's
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.200]   like here, we're...
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   They're charity driven and by all means, have your picture taken with us.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   We also have someone who was going to be...
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.160]   If you want to press a few dollars in their hands, they will...
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.520]   That might be we'll go to a children's charity.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.760]   They like children's charity.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   We had the 501st on the...
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.960]   Screen savers many moons ago, but they were just stormtroopers at the time.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   You can push down.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.720]   You make them sound as though it's like there's like...
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.960]   There's like larva, then like cocoon, and then...
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   That'd be fun.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   ...body from Earth.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   ...the evolution of cosplay.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   Or maybe more like Pokemon.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.120]   There's like the third generation Charmander.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]   That's what I want.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.120]   The evolution of cosplay.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.000]   That would be a YouTube hit.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So what...
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.240]   What camera do you use these with these?
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   This one is, I think...
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000]   I think that's actually the Lumia 1020.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.800]   Did you have it in your pocket the whole time?
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.600]   I was shooting so much with it that I had it from myself.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.560]   Andy, you do have a compact micro four thirds real camera at your hip that you could possibly
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   be taking pictures with.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   That would be taking better pictures right now, but the Lumia was doing such a good job
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.320]   for most of the event.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.720]   It was like, okay.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   People might be less intimidated by another dude with a phone camera as opposed to a...
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Excuse me, la.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   I'm gonna...
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   I'll wet your bottom lip a little bit.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.280]   Perse your left lip a little bit more.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.720]   I want some flair on the cape.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.640]   And remember, energy now three two five.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   So we're here to talk about back-and-toshes, but...
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   You know, I have to...
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   I don't know, apologize or explain because we...
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   Especially after last week's episode where we spent some time talking about Google and
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.880]   what Google was up to.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.000]   People seemed to get a little irate saying, you know, you should only talk about Mac-and-toshes
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.640]   on the show or Apple on the show.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.880]   You should not talk about anything else.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.720]   And I thought about that a little bit and I realized it was a kind of a misunderstanding
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.400]   and that people think we're Lord of the Rings and we're really Game of Thrones.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.680]   So what I mean by that is there's two ways you can go with this kind of stuff.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.200]   Journalists, of course, tell stories.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   We take fact.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   This is what the show is about, right?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   We take facts and we put them, sew them together to make a...
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.840]   What we believe to be an accurate and coherent story.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.040]   Then there are other kinds of shows that do mythology.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.840]   And we don't do.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   We're not into mythology.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.160]   And that's why I say Lord of the Rings versus Game of Thrones.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.440]   You know, if you think you're reading Lord of the Rings and somebody says something
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.400]   and it scares you or upsets you, that you might say, well, wait a minute.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.000]   I thought I was reading mythology.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.600]   If you're reading Game of Thrones, which is loosely based on actual history, you know,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.320]   reading history and Richard III brings the two little boys up in the tower and slits
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   their throats.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   It's history.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   You don't get upset.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.560]   If you're reading a novel and the same thing happens at a wedding, some people get upset,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.080]   but that's because you don't understand that George RR Martin is kind of more on the historical
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   side than the mythos side.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.960]   So I would say we're trying to tell a coherent story, but a coherent story that is in our
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.480]   opinion, an accurate, and we certainly debate all of this stuff, but an accurate reflection
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   of what's going on in the world around us.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.960]   If you are looking for mythos about Apple, you got the wrong podcast.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.200]   And I can understand you're upset if you're reading Game of Thrones and you thought you're
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.640]   reading Lord of the Rings.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.080]   So I prefer to think that we are doing the entire weather system of Apple, which involves
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.840]   the Earth and the Sun and the atmosphere.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.200]   And some things are not the...
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.080]   If the Apple is the Earth, the Earth is surrounded by atmosphere and Google is part of that
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   atmosphere.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.400]   So we'll talk about Google, but only as it relates to people like us who really dig
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   Apple and spend most of our time running Apple products.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.920]   And I don't say that.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.960]   I'm not trying to apologize.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.600]   I'm trying to explain so that you know what it is that you are listening to.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.040]   I have that silly French train station, "Boop, now on my Apple."
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.480]   - "Excelon l'io."
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.640]   - "S'est trèbien."
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   - "Excelon l'io."
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   And so I just want you to know that that's not kind of what we're doing here.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.200]   This is intended to be, for better or worse, whether we succeed or fail to be a journalist
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.280]   to get a price in which we cover technology, trying to understand it.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   And you're right.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   - Absolutely, Andy.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   There's a universe.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.960]   - We're not being called fanboys and haters in the same show, "L'io, we shouldn't have
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   heard of that thing."
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.760]   - I have been, by the way.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.600]   - That's the thing you know it's right.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   - I feel you know it's right.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   - Exactly.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   - Yeah.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   - Yeah.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.240]   - That's the he said, she said journalism that CNN is doing lately where, "Hey, there
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.600]   are two sides of the story as long as we tell both sides, then we're okay.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.000]   We're not doing that either.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.800]   We actually are trying to figure out what's true, what's right."
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   And that may not.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.880]   You know, one of the reasons this came into my mind is the jobs movie, which is coming
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   out.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.080]   Have either of you seen that yet?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   - No.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   - I saw parts of it at Macworld.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.040]   - It's gonna be, now, well, see, this will be interesting because it is, is it mythos?
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.560]   You'd be crazy to make a jobs movie that wasn't.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.840]   I mean, the social networks are a good example of that.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.320]   That was a fairy tale about Facebook.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.240]   It wasn't what really happened.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.760]   I presume jobs will be like that.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.000]   - I remember correctly, the part they showed at Macworld was Steve Jobs telling Woz what
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   a computer was.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   - Yeah.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   - That was kind of interesting.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.320]   - And apparently Woz dressing up like Weird All Yankovic in a necktie in 1975.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.240]   It's like, I don't think Jobs has ever worn a necktie, ever.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   - No, at HP, I think I've seen a picture of him in an appropriately mid-70s, like, you
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.240]   know, a big fat white tie.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.080]   - Well, like a newly hired Apollo 17 controller sort of outfit, short sleeve dress shirt, nice
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.760]   fat striped tie.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.480]   I mean, I'm looking forward to Aaron Sorkin's take on it, which doesn't try to set up the
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.960]   entire young boy Edison storyline.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.880]   But mostly says here are a few key keynotes that he delivered and the events that surrounded
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.000]   it at different portions of his career at Apple.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.840]   And so that will hopefully tell you the tale of who a little bit about who Steve Jobs was.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.280]   I have my prejudices.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.440]   I've seen the trailer and my problem with Ashton Kutcher is that I don't mean this in
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.040]   a funny way or in a tacking way.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.080]   It's just that I don't believe he's noted for a very wide range of emotions.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.000]   And so I'm just not sure that if there has to be a scene of Steve being upset with somebody
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.520]   and conveying that in a very dramatic way, I'm not sure if I see that coming from Ashton
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   Kutcher.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.760]   - But I just wish it would come out already.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.240]   I mean, we've been watching the trailers since Macworld not this year, but the year before
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.640]   and every time I get a news tip but another trailer, I don't even want to publish them
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   anymore.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   Just to move you out already.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   - Well, there is.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   - Okay, so there is a new trailer.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.920]   - I can't take it.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   - One more.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   One more.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   - Can you hold the hooks up to the TV for the display?
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   - Uh, Steve?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   - Wow.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   - Welcome to Apple Computer.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   - It's gonna be so cool.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   - It's just a kid.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   - Is this the best one?
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   - You're just a kid.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   - Alright, alright, okay.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   - This is everything.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   - Start up.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   - You expect things to be a little bit more difficult than you're going to be.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more difficult.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more difficult than you're going to be.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.680]   - You expecting something else?
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.720]   - Maybe something a little less mad than family.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   - He's got those look.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   I'll do them that.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.400]   - Hey Steve, what's going on?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   - Steve, you're on the Macintosh.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   - What's a Macintosh?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.360]   - This kind of makes me want to see it.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:52.200]   - I'm trying to build Apple and they're taking it away from me.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.360]   - You are your own worst enemy and these companies.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:04.080]   - When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way that it is.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   - You want to get back what you lost?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   - This is the time.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   - Why never lost it?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   - I just stole it.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.360]   - Look at that, that's the later Steve.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   That's pretty good.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   - Life can be much more...
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   - We're criticizing his later Steve.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   I thought he was good.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   - He's still.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.600]   - You can embrace it, change it.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.400]   - You refuse to do anything that vaguely escapes your comfort zone.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.400]   Make your mark upon it.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600]   - I'll be making sure that Boba O'Reilly is a little odd.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.240]   But I think he was more to Dylan than the who.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   - It bothers me they're kind of amping up the legend as opposed to...
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.160]   - Oh, all miss.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.240]   - I think he's more inspirational as a person than as...
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.080]   I'd rather see him at life-sized than at heroic scale.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.400]   But I mean, remember the audience, you're not naming for...
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.040]   - People who knew him or people who followed him closely, you're aiming for the general
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.360]   broad general public.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.160]   And they want to see King Arthur.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   - That's a way to get a 2.8 share in lifetime, but not a good way to make sure.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.080]   - That's a movie that I'll be talking about.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   - That's a movie that we're talking about.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   - It's a movie that we can't find.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   - I don't know.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.520]   I have to say I was very down on this movie from what I'd seen before.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   This one kind of gets me...
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.320]   See, I don't go to the movies.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   I don't mind if it's...
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   - Yeah, I can't.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   - You're right.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.800]   - I mean, absolutely not judging movie I haven't seen yet.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.080]   - Tony Stark, really, when you get to know him was not the man that's portrayed in the
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   movie.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   I think it's very important to understand that.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.680]   It's kind of a dick.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.280]   - No, I'm just...
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   - Well played.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.040]   - This is the Tony Stark version of Steve Jardin...
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.960]   - You're not gonna hear me defend any movie representation of any Marvel character.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.800]   I think of the Marvel movies the way that I think of the Star Wars books that they're
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   fan fiction.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   They didn't really happen there.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.840]   If it happened in the movies and that's real canonical things that I need to care about.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.960]   As good as the movies are, as the Marvel movies are, as good as the books are, they don't
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.280]   register to me as well.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   It's okay that I don't think they got that, right?
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.080]   Because I still have the comics.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   That's why.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.640]   - So far, 43% in Rotten Tomatoes, which is a very low...
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   That's a splat.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   - But who?
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.360]   - How many people have actually seen it?
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   - It's not wide, really.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.160]   - Really rating, exactly.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.560]   - As with any movie, you don't go into a movie theater hoping to see a bad movie.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.600]   You go into a movie theater hoping to see a good movie.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.440]   - I'll definitely be seeing it.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.680]   - I was saying I'm not gonna see that.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.760]   That sounds horrible until I saw this trailer and then I went, "Oh."
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.680]   You know, if I get chills a few times through the movie going, yeah, and there was a few
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.280]   points when he said, for instance, "You gotta get out of your comfort zone."
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   There are a few points.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.560]   You're now on the Mac team.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   What's a Mac?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   - You're like, "Yeah, chills."
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   It's like, "Yeah."
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.280]   So if I feel that way when I come out of the movie, even if though you and I will all...
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.880]   We'll go, because that was so wrong.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.520]   - Yeah, that's where we may not be the right people to judge it.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.000]   That's how I felt about the Watchmen movie, for instance.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.800]   Since I have such a close knowledge of the source material, I don't know if this makes
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.000]   sense to anybody else.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.720]   I don't know if something that might bother me, nobody else would care about.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.560]   So I think there's gonna have to be like star or asterisked reviews.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   - Right.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.680]   - Okay, are you in the tech industry at all?
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.120]   Okay, then we get to...
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.080]   Your thoughts still matter, but we'll put this on the side to make sure that people don't
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.360]   say, "Come on."
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.640]   First of all, negotiations with Motorola on the 68,000 process were not initiated in
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   the 70s.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.640]   They were still in...
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.720]   How many moved on to risk yet?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   Come on.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.920]   I used to go to a movie because the friend of mine was a mechanic and he would always criticize
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.520]   that car, just can't turn a corner like that.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.640]   It all depends on what you know about.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.800]   - I think we did that with the social network.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.760]   If taken by itself, it was a great movie, but taken with any knowledge at all of what
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.000]   really happened, it was like, "Come on."
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.680]   But it was, again, it was that myth-making thing.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.480]   And I'm sure I have to tell you, Andy, Sorkin's gonna make wass and jobs and the whole gang
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.720]   be fast talking fast walking, you know, razzamataz guys.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   - Six and ten and pick them.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   - If you're gonna talk about Sorkin, this is...
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.160]   Jobs must be like the perfect subject for him because he's probably the only person other
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.960]   than President Bartlett that if he rattles off statistics down to three decimal places
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.040]   off the top of it said, "You imagine that?"
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.680]   No, I don't think that an associate news producer on a cable news network would know
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:36.400]   that I do think that Steve Jobs would know that 12.1415 students, percent of all students
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.080]   in the North American continents is 1983, have not touched a computer more than three hours
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.480]   a day since 1978.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.760]   I think that he can stay tuned.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.240]   - I do relish the Sorkin interpretation of Steve Jobs.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   - It's the dialogue.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.400]   - Yeah, the dialogue will be great.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.920]   So I am gonna go see this.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   You're right.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.560]   Renee, you have to see it.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.360]   We have to see it, but I really was resisting it, especially because the portrayal of was
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.720]   even someone insulting.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.960]   And was himself felt insulted by it when he saw it.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   - The trailer.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.080]   - Especially in the first trailer that hit, where the one in the parking garage where
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:16.680]   you're like, "I'm not sure that was needed to be taught about what a personal computer
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.840]   was.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   I think that he kind of had a handle on it."
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.680]   It was the other way around, obviously.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   - Yeah.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.880]   - It's gonna make for some great viewing parties one way or another, though.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   I mean, this is...
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.240]   I'm serious.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.760]   I hope to go with four or five friends who will be able to have the same sort of reaction
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.560]   and view it in the same way that I am.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.000]   So I don't feel like one person who has to...
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.680]   With the time that I saw the movie "Hackers" in a screening room with professional movie
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   critics, and I had to stifle every reaction I had to everything that was happening because
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.160]   my reactions were both logical but abnormal for a typical audience.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.760]   - Coming in over the RSS, Andy.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   Coming in over the RSS.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.160]   - We have 96-14 our chairman says there should be a movie.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   - It was.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.440]   I wouldn't mind seeing that.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.520]   That would be a more interesting movie.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.840]   - So last week we speculated that Bob Mansfield had stepped out from the executive team to
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.440]   work on the iWatch.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.000]   Now Mark Gurman at 9-5 Mac writes, and I think Mark's pretty well placed that his sources
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   say, "No, he's gonna focus on chipset design plus future products.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.440]   Does this change, Renee, what you think Bob Mansfield is up to?
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.360]   Remember he was senior vice president of technologies.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.200]   Suddenly a week ago taken off the Apple executive team.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Not much explanation from Apple.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.680]   - No, that changes at all.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   - No?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.160]   - No, I mean Mark's got fantastic sources but I think he just, he heard similar to what
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.920]   a lot of other people heard and he just managed to get a lot of details on it which are important.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.560]   But I think, you know, the chipset and all the stuff he's working on, there's gonna be
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.080]   chipsets in the iWatch, there's gonna be chipsets in, there's gonna be an Apple A7 processor
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.320]   and I think it's all part and parcel of where he wants to focus his energy.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.560]   You know, he was basically told he could write his own ticket and that's the ticket he wanted
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   to write.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:11.320]   - Yeah, I mean Mark writes, as a wealthy long time executive, who, and wealthy is the right
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.520]   word, what it was, $85 million, they gave him to stick around a couple extra years.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.040]   It sounds like though he's not gonna run the iWatch team that he's gonna be working on
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.880]   chipsets or chips that some of which may appear in the iWatch, he's gonna be part of it but
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.120]   not running the team.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.560]   It's funny because according to us, this is Mark again writing in 9 to 5 Mac, according
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.800]   to a source familiar with the former technologies team, there's been a lack of formal internal
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   communication regarding the reasoning behind the management shift.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.720]   However, the company did make the new executive roles clear to these employees and I presume
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.600]   that's where Mark's getting this information.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.000]   And with a lack of communication, sources say the change is not unprecedented over the
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   past couple of months.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.800]   Mansfield has said to have been increasingly focused on chips and some aspects of wireless
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.280]   while delegating his other teams to other executives.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.440]   Sources with knowledge of Mansfield's line of thinking also say the executive would very
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.680]   much like to retire on his new California coast castle.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.880]   I would like to really.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.440]   I would like to retire on my new California coast.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.280]   Apparently he's has a wants to build a 9,000 square foot home.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.880]   He owns 45 acres in Bonnie Dune, which I've been to a beautiful, beautiful area up there
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.360]   in the Santa Cruz mountains.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.640]   There's not much going on up there.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.320]   But he's got the money goodness knows to build a castle in Bonnie Dune.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.240]   Also, I've always thought that Northern California was under protected by sea assault from like
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   1730s style.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.480]   Well, Bonnie Dune's way up in the hills.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.200]   But I guess if you had good long range cannon, you are overlooking the Santa Cruz harbor.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.440]   So you could protect it.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.280]   There's actually a lot of battle going on over this.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.040]   According to the Santa Cruz Sentinel, local community is not thrilled about the castle.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.520]   I can defend the city.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.760]   The home would sit atop an old quarry that one neighborhood historian.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.800]   Oh, this is Santa Cruz in a nutshell.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.960]   I went to high school there.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.600]   One neighborhood historian believes that provided the asphalt to pave downtown Pacific
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.760]   Avenue as well as San Francisco's Market Street.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.600]   I do not believe that quarry should be disturbed.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.840]   No, no, no, the reason why he's finding for this, if he's anything like the people who
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.440]   use the Quincy quarry here in New England, it's because at one point they pushed a car
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   into that quarry.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.960]   But it's not about the insurance money.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.760]   There are a lot of people who do not want that drain.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.960]   It would be a shame if it were to be drained.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.480]   That's where Jimmy Hoffa is.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.520]   The majesty of the surroundings is just out.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   This is the Santa Cruz Sentinel.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   It's just outside the Northern border of Wilder State Ranch Park is matched by the architectural
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   plans.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   I've been there.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   I'm telling you, it's gorgeous.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   It's redwoods.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   It's very remote.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.120]   It's a very long, twisty road to get up there.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.360]   The 9,000 square foot home, about 6,000 square feet of which is above grade.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.840]   What does that mean?
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   Looking down?
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   What is it?
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.640]   They're saying 3,000 feet is in the mountain.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.480]   Includes a basement theater and an agricultural roof.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.840]   It probably has own ship boundary.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.440]   Four barns in that door kitchen, a potting shed, even a herd of goats.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.320]   Hey, don't knock the goats.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.720]   If you live in a place like Bonny Doon, you need something to eat the poison ivy.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.120]   I don't blame Bob Mansfield for wanting to go to his castle.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.880]   Even with that in mind, these people, according to Mark Gurman, believe Mansfield will never
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.080]   fully separate himself from Apple.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.280]   Bonny Doon is close to Apple.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.520]   You could get to Apple in about 45 minutes from Bonny now.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.800]   Even the executives dedicated to the company would like to contribute to Apple in some
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:00.400]   fashion, even in retirement, these people say Mansfield really has the entire company's
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   best interest in heart.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.160]   That's got to be tough.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.120]   When you're at a company, you love this company, but you also have $85 million in your pocket.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.920]   You just feel done.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.280]   But if that were important to you, wouldn't you have stopped at $20 million?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   No.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.280]   That's something...
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   No, you're right.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   There's some point.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   It's a castle handy.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.840]   It's not cheap to build a castle.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:30.320]   I guess, well, is this like a look at the changing face of screw you money that if you've
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   got $3 million or $4 million, you can't be stupid with it, or else at some point you
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.960]   will not be rich anymore.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.680]   You'll be secure for the rest of your life, but you will no longer be able to just pack
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.480]   up and go to London for an ice cream and then come back.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.800]   $85 million is definitely...
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.600]   I would have to be very drunk for a very long time in order to at any point not have
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.240]   more money than I ever know what to deal with.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   That's a lot of it.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.680]   You could buy a Gulfstream and still have money left over.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.600]   Well, that's why I'm always impressed with decisions like this one that seem to be very
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.100]   much on what kind of...
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.240]   Based on what kind of life do I want to live at this point in my life?
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.400]   Because this is not...
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.280]   Mansfield is not someone who has had the spotlight, so if he wanted the spotlight at another
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.760]   company, he could have had it, he did not want it.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.080]   He clearly was not motivated by anything more than what direction he wants to follow,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.480]   or else he would have really...
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.200]   It just seems like a question of personal judgment and personal character, the sort of
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.760]   thing that really impresses me.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.400]   When I see that kind of idea where someone was offered a huge amount of money to stay
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.160]   at the company they were at, unless there was another offer on the table that was out
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.040]   that their original employer obeyed them, that usually means that, okay, there is some
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.640]   intangibles I have nothing to do with money, but at some point the ability to finance a
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.320]   feature film that I...
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.480]   Why the film writes my favorite book and have a decent budget and film made out of it based
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.800]   on the fact that I can simply stay at this job that I really like for a couple more years,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.760]   that's an interesting position to be in.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.440]   If you leave now you can have a small fort or a keep, but if you stay for the number two
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.840]   years you can have the cast.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.240]   And also, I mean, 45 minutes, it's a lot less given the system of pneumatic do's underground
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.720]   he's laying in with all that money.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.760]   You could have a hyperloop to Apple's campus.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   How many newspapers does that buy?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.840]   Do you watch it in post?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   No he couldn't, that was a quarter of a billion, he could buy the Boston Globe though.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.480]   The Globe's chief.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:33.840]   I'm sorry Andy, you're still working for one of America's last great newspapers in Chicago
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   Sun-Time.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.960]   Do the Wrigley family still own that?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.120]   Who owns that?
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   I have no idea, I don't own it.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.400]   My Andy, that's all I know.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   I have no idea.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   Well who signs the check Andy?
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   No, no, no.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   The third sky on of the Sun-Time's family.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.940]   I think that I heard that the Sun-Times were up for sale.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.040]   I shouldn't really belabor that you probably.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.400]   I should check myself because you put it in the middle.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.240]   We don't want to scare Andy or anything.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.640]   All right, we're going to talk about Apple has friends in high places like the White
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.520]   House, we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.840]   Also the strong rumors, and I know you'll have a lot to say about this Rene Richie being
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:25.680]   the man of rumor, the A7 chip and what the new iPhone.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   We're getting close now.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:32.080]   Do you think we're as close as a month away from the new iPhone early September?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.120]   I don't know about early but September-ish sounds reasonable.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.240]   I just want to let Apple know and I know they care a lot about my personal convenience
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.560]   and I will be leaving the country on September 17th.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.280]   So if you could have that event before then, that would be nice.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   What?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   Nothing.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.120]   What do you know, Andy?
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.800]   Are you saying, are you know something and you're not saying it?
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   Look at that.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   I know nothing that I'm not saying it.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   This is bad.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   No, no, nothing and say it.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.440]   But sometimes I feel like when there are these pauses of nothing happening in the show,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.200]   it allows the audience to get into a more contemplative mode.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   Exactly.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.800]   I'm surprised if Andy had a lot of engagements during September, October in general any year.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   Yeah, if you're an Apple journalist, you pretty much want to keep those months clear.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:22.480]   Yeah, there was that time where I agree to speak to a user group for free on the same
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.600]   week, like on their big anniversary event on the year.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.760]   It happened to be the day that they announced something, one of the new iPhones or iPods
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.080]   or something.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.360]   And I decided after a lot of soul searching that I think the cooler thing to do would
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.400]   be to simply keep the date.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.760]   And they know that I would definitely have something to talk about as opposed to.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.520]   Lunchman says the gift card promo for students in September 6th.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.160]   So he is of the opinion September 7th will be the release date.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.960]   No correlation.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.520]   No, usually that means just that's when people are in school by then.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.600]   I know I have to pay Henry's tuition, college tuition by September 4th.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.240]   So I think that that's a reasonable thing.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   We're going to take a break when we come back more with Renee Ritchie, imore.com.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.840]   I was going to say Alex Lindsey, but he's not here, is he?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Was he going to be here?
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   No, no.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.560]   Well, country is he in now.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.560]   I actually think he's in America.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.560]   Wow.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.640]   But I believe that he had a conflict of shooting.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.560]   Yeah, he had to do something.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.680]   That's Chad Johnson, our producer.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.480]   And of course Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   I showed it.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   I brought to you by our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.520]   We're going to ask you to tweet some more.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.360]   Actually, I should look back at the tweets from last week.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.640]   If you have a squarespace site and you'd like us to highlight it, send out a tweet with
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.880]   the hashtag #MacBreakSquareSpace.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   MacBreakSquareSpace.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   I don't think we've done this on Twitter, didn't we?
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.640]   We didn't do it on MacBreak.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.760]   So tweet away and we'll highlight before the end of the day some of those sites and maybe
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.840]   later on too.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   What is squarespace?
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.880]   Golly, you must be new to the show.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.520]   Squarespace is the best web hosting.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.840]   The best web content management system merged into one to make a unified platform that is
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.040]   perfect for your next website.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.480]   If it's a blog, couldn't be better for blogging.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.760]   Their iPad, iPhone apps are so beautiful, so easy to use.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.480]   In fact, they have such good mobile developers they've released, other apps like the Squarespace
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.160]   Notes app because it's just gorgeous.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:32.400]   If you are an artist, a photographer, a painter, a sculptor, an architect, the portfolio templates
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.480]   they have are spectacular.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.200]   If you want to do commerce, somebody called me up and said, "Oh, I hear Squarespace doesn't
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   do e-commerce."
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.640]   What are you talking about?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.000]   Oh, man does Squarespace do commerce.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.440]   Look at, there's people selling ties.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   Graham Withers sells ties and it is the easiest, simplest way to set up commerce with all the
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:59.080]   features you want including tax calculations, shipping, inventory, unlimited digital or
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.880]   physical products.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.480]   When I tell you the price, you're going to say it's not even possible.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.840]   Take a look at the, here's what you should probably do.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.160]   Go to squarespace.com and play with it.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   They give you two weeks.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.760]   You don't even need to give them a credit card or anything.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.600]   You could just try it totally free for two weeks.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.720]   You'll start by picking a template and that's actually maybe the hardest part because they're
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   gorgeous.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.920]   But here's the good news.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.160]   Once you import your content into that template, you can change templates at will as with the
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.920]   best web designs, the content and the designer, completely separate.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.840]   You don't need to be a master of web design either.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.120]   All you need to do is have an eye for what you want.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.000]   You start with those beautiful templates.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.080]   Make it your own.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.560]   If you know CSS JavaScript, they do have a great developer platform but it's not necessary.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.320]   A wonderful support team 24/7 and you'll have access to them even during the free trial.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.560]   Two weeks free at squarespace.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.200]   Just click the try it button and get started button and you'll be able to get in there.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   Now if you decide to buy, wow, you're going to just flip your lid.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.480]   Go ahead and show the price.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   They won't believe it.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.360]   Basic, now these are annual prices.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.560]   You can't go month to month.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.680]   It's a little bit more month to month.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.000]   But for a standard plan, $8 a month, for the unlimited plan, that's what most people do,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   $16 a month.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   What do you get?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.080]   Unlimited everything, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.400]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   That's unheard of.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:27.640]   Even with our big fancy servers that we run over at Softlayer, they have a limit on bandwidth.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.400]   Unlimited storage, unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited contributors.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.600]   This is $16 bucks a month.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:40.120]   When you sign up for the year-long plan, you get $16 bucks a month, $20 bucks a month.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.800]   But to get the year-long plan for a couple of reasons, first of all, because they will
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.840]   give you a free domain name registration and they'll hook it all up for you.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.280]   The other reason is we're going to give you 10% discount on your first purchase, so that
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   means you'll save even more.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.680]   10% off when you use the offer code MAC break 8.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   E-commerce is $24 bucks a month.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   That's everything.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Unlimited.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.520]   They don't take a cut of your sales or anything.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.920]   It's just, I love square space.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   You want to try it?
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   Please.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.800]   For two weeks, mobile responsive design means it looks great on every size screen SEO optimized
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.120]   with complete integration with all the social networks.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.680]   Squarespace.com.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.920]   Our offer code for the month of August is MAC break 8.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.280]   Please remember that and use it if you can when you buy.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.680]   That way we get a little bit of a bump.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.880]   Actually, we get paid this.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.280]   It doesn't give us, I should explain that.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.480]   I think sometimes people say, "Oh, you get paid per signup.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   No, we don't.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   We get the same amount."
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.080]   But then Squarespace knows that, "Oh, people listen at MAC break."
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.880]   And we would like them to think that.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.920]   So, let's all fold.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.280]   Andy and Ico, Renee Ritchie, we're talking about Macintosh, Apple.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.880]   They must have friends in high places.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.640]   Now, this is a complicated story.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   I've been doing a lot of reading around it, this patent story.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.800]   So, first of all, you may be fooled by the name International Trade Commission.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   It isn't.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.000]   It's the United States International Trade Commission.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Samsung, instead of suing in court over a patent infringement, went to the ITC.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.200]   It turns out a lot of companies are starting to do this.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   It's much faster.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.800]   It's much simpler.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.760]   And the ITC, and they requested a ban on five Apple devices.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.400]   The patent was what we call a "fran" patent.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:36.200]   That is a basic patent that the general trade law requires a company make available for licensing
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.360]   under "fran" terms, "fair", "reasonable" and "non-discriminatory".
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:49.080]   In other words, a kind of a reasonable licensing.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.720]   Apple got a rather a Samsung got the ITC to agree to ban the iPhone 4, the 3GS, the iPad
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.760]   2, five different Apple products.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:05.840]   And as of Monday, they could have no longer be imported into the United States.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   But Apple got a reprieve.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.760]   It's almost like you're in the electric chair and a call comes in from the governor and says,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:19.560]   "Okay, over the weekend, President Obama signed a reprieve."
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:27.240]   Now it came from, the presidential veto, it came from one of the ITC's six commissioners
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.400]   who- The federal trade representative.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   Right.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.200]   Who said, "No, this was wrong."
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.340]   Samsung made no effort to demonstrate that the licensing terms it offered Apple were
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.760]   objectively reasonable.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.480]   They were supposed to be "fran", remember.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.760]   The only time Samsung made an offer, which was in oral discussions December 2012, it
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.920]   came with strings attached which Apple could not agree.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.760]   Obviously, Apple went to this guy and said, "Look, let's lay out the case for why this
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.880]   shouldn't be banned."
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.200]   We don't know what the strings were because they were redacted.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.640]   But in the opinion he writes, "It is neither fair nor discriminatory for the holder of
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:09.720]   the Fran and Cumbered Patton," Samsung, "to require licensees to non-Fran and Cumbered
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.520]   Patton, such as a condition for licensing its patent, from which you can assume that
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.600]   what Samsung said is, "Okay, we'll license this patent."
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.800]   Nobody disagrees by the way that Samsung has the license and Apple needs to- Samsung has
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.200]   a patent and Apple needs to license it.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.000]   That seems to be generally agreed to.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.360]   But it sounds like what Samsung said was two things, one, we want a lot of money and more
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.600]   importantly, two, "We'll give you this patent as long as you drop these other suits or you
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.560]   allow us a license fee for rubber banding or whatever it was."
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:49.280]   Foyan Mueller, who's the author of "Foss Patton's," said, "I am outraged.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.960]   The underlying rationale of the ITC ruling," this was the first ruling, "the ban, is a
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.920]   serious threat to innovation and competition.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.560]   Among other things, it represents a radical departure from well-established antitrust
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.800]   principles concerning the illegal practice of tying," in this case, the Samsung proposal
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.920]   that required Apple to license non-standard essential patents to Samsung in order to get
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.520]   the Fran license, "runs totally counter to the ITC's mission to protect the domestic
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   industry."
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:28.920]   On Saturday, the Obama administration agreed in vetoed the ban.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.360]   Some say that it's possible that the ITC commissioners who voted for the ban were hoping
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.800]   that the president would jump in.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.600]   When fact, we're hoping that this would become a cause-celebrus to highlight the fact that
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.400]   the system is fairly well broken.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.000]   It's really interesting.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.760]   Some people saw it, I think South Korea said that it was a nationalistic move, but it was
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.720]   very hard to understand the ITC's original ruling.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.920]   It's almost like, and this patent stuff is really complicated, it makes for a little
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.200]   sense, but it's almost like if you decide to build a community pool and you get all sorts
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.240]   of resources to help you build a community pool, but your only requirement is that you
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.400]   have to let everybody in the community reasonably swim in that pool and you tell this one family
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.200]   that they can't come in unless they let you go over and soak in their hot tub, that's
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.280]   when it starts to become difficult.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.000]   You know, Samsung benefited by these patents becoming part of the standard, which means
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.720]   that every phone that wants to use the network or conform to basic usefulness as a device
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.680]   has to use these patents.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.840]   What Samsung and Motorola have also been doing is suing over these standards essential patents
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.800]   and requesting proprietary patents, Apple didn't offer their patents for standards and
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.600]   not required to license them reasonably in exchange for that.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.840]   It's egregious enough in the EU that they're being investigated for it in an antitrust investigation,
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.600]   but in the US they approved it at first.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.840]   I think that's a fairly accurate assessment of why the administration had to reverse it.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:02.200]   I mean, this is such a complicated case and I've kind of avoided getting into the, as
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   I usually do with patent cases, lawsuits, that kind of thing because it's so complicated,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.880]   but I thought I'd bring this up because it certainly is a big story.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.500]   And yeah, on the surface, you might say, well, the president intervened to advantage
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.300]   an American company over a Korean company, but I think when you dig into it, that's not
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   the case.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.460]   And Apple does have some standards patents and if they ever sued over them and the president
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.220]   vetoed it, I mean, I would approve of that just as a patent in general or a horribly
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.220]   broken thing.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.620]   But when you have a patent as a standard and everybody has to use it, like you're forced
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.160]   to use it if you want that device to exist, then you have to start being very careful
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.460]   how you regulate that industry.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.060]   Yeah, Fran is a very good thing for us as consumers.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.380]   Otherwise, you wouldn't have a variety of choices for phones, for instance.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.900]   And it's good for Samsung because otherwise someone else's technology would have been
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.700]   chosen and they'd have the benefit of massive licensing fees for their patents.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.460]   Right.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.660]   By the way, Samsung is going to be, according to rumors, making components that will go
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.340]   in the new iPhone chip.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:12.740]   This is from code in iOS seven about a, uh, a seven iPhone chip in the, uh, XML, Apple,
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:19.220]   Samsung, DPT, X controller, SL, S five, L, 89, 60 X.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.460]   Close to space modulator.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.220]   The binary language of, I love it.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:35.340]   Into a nine to five Mac, that's a leap over the S five, I 89 50 X or the S five, I 89 55
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.980]   X, which were respectively the A six and the A six X.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:46.220]   So an A seven chip in the, uh, the new iPhone is in a five S or a five C and why do we both
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.220]   will say C?
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.380]   There's both.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.860]   C is for cheap color.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.380]   Oh, but the color one will be the cheap one.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.140]   It'll be less expensive.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.140]   Yes.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.060]   I think I'm sure Apple will come up with three reasons why the, what the C stands for.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.300]   It stands for, well, someone actually sent me a tip saying the S must have stood for
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.260]   Steve and now the C is going to stand for cook.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.860]   Well, the S stood for three different things, right?
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.180]   It stood for speed and three GS or something.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:17.860]   It stood for Siri in the four S. I don't know if it ever stood for Steve, but they, they
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.540]   say Steve because Steve died right before the forest came out.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.580]   But yeah, there's, it is, there are very few companies in the world that can produce the
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.420]   kinds of chips that Apple needs and the quantity of the iPhone production hundreds of millions
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.420]   a unit.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.420]   So it's not surprising.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.660]   I don't know how to say there are very few companies in the world that can produce the
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.100]   kind of idle speculation and rumors and Apple produces.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.100]   Well, that too.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.100]   That's the third speculation.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:47.940]   Oh, but I mean, Samsung is also a conglomerate and people forget that it's not one company.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.580]   It's like a cadet to in Japan where they have multiple branches.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.780]   And while there is, you know, well, what happened with one branch might affect another branch.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.140]   There's still Intel's not going to make these chips.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   So they're going to have to go somewhere to get them made.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.460]   So we are at beta five.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.900]   I mean, we're, we're pretty far along despite the developer, the downtime of the dev center
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.900]   and so forth.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.900]   We're pretty far along.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.420]   Are we, do you think at this point you, I don't know if you've seen it.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.060]   If you have you, I know you can't say I have not.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.980]   I would say even if I had, I couldn't, but I can.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.900]   So I won't.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.180]   But does that seem like we're now done?
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.180]   Are we ready to manufacture?
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.180]   Mm.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.860]   Can't be too much longer if they're going to come out in September.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.620]   Probably not.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.900]   I've from what I've read through publicly available sources online.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.820]   There's, there's, it's not ready for consumer use yet.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.900]   There's still, there's still a couple of, I wouldn't say show stopping problems with
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.180]   it, but things that really have to be ironed out, especially if you're going to go from
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:50.020]   an installed user base of in the, in the low six figures or high five figures to an
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.980]   installed user base in the tens of millions.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   Right.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.260]   But you know, there is a, there is a kind of a lead time where you have to start putting
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.820]   it on the phones.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.460]   You know, Microsoft used to do this when they were putting out copies of Windows eight.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.740]   They called it the gold master back when you actually.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.980]   Apple does the same thing.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.140]   They call it a gold master.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.980]   And it almost always gets delivered to developers the day of the announcement event.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.100]   Developers are the last.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.740]   But, but to manufacture, it's got to go at some point sooner than later.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.180]   If they're cranking them out now, in other words, if you want to have five million phones
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:28.340]   ready on ship date, presuming that ship date is somewhere around six weeks from now,
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.660]   which I think is not unfair, you're making them now and you, you got to put the OS on
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.740]   it while you're making it, don't you?
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.780]   There's usually six to eight betas.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.180]   Like if you look, if past behaviors, future behavior, that's usually six to eight betas.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.340]   And then the last one usually is a while and then the gold master comes out on ship date.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.180]   So I wouldn't be surprised if they stuck to that pattern, either the next one or the
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.820]   one after that unless there's any showstoppers and there have been showstoppers in the past
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.580]   where they had to reissue even a gold master.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.580]   But happens.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.420]   But if you know, the next one or the one after that or, you know, maybe the one after that,
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.620]   but we're getting into the whole question.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.740]   One one should remember that it's not unusual to get a new iPhone and have to do an update
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.740]   right away.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.420]   So if there is a showstopper that can be patched.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.140]   This part of the activation process is why sometimes it takes an awful long time.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.340]   Because it's doing a patch that, yeah.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   Right.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.740]   So what do we think?
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:24.060]   Is there any insight to be gained from the fact that we're at beta five?
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.060]   It's on schedule.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.500]   I mean, they were a week and I hate to say late.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.980]   People say they're late or people assume that Apple releases a new beta every month,
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.980]   every second Monday.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.260]   And that's because often they do, but they've gone weeks without them.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.260]   They've done them on Saturdays.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.700]   They did it on a Tuesday today.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.700]   They waited one week.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.700]   They've waited three weeks.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.940]   In general, every second week is a good pattern and they're almost exactly on that right now.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.540]   Also, a lot of people tend to be confused when they don't see a lot of visible movement
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.180]   in the betas.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.860]   They really want to see, oh, well, there's going to be another beta in which everything
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:00.060]   is no longer translucent and there's no longer layer thing and they put the sharing icon back
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.660]   the way it was before because that's obviously what they're going to be doing soon.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:10.100]   It's just such a tremendous undertaking for any full-digit release of iOS, even if it
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.660]   weren't as monumental as iOS 7, that we're going to see a lot of updates in which we don't
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.860]   see a lot of new behaviors, but we're seeing that a lot of people under the hood making
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.020]   sure that battery life is going to be exactly what it should be, that connectivity is going
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.500]   to be exactly where it should be.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.780]   Reliability has to be absolutely perfect out of the gator.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.820]   This will be the first failure of a failure to launch of any iOS update that Apple has
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   ever released.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.260]   They usually have a few features that they only show off at the event that has to do
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.260]   with new hardware, whether it's a panel.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.460]   They like, you know, Phil Schiller will have his demo and Craig Figurigul have another
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.660]   demo and there'll be one or two things that are just announced there that'll have to
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.460]   go on the new phones that we won't usually don't get leaked in the betas.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.540]   They're still a cycle ahead of us.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:57.180]   They know that people are going to be disassembling the entire thing, looking for references
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.180]   to things that don't exist yet.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   Right.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.180]   Like the i7.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.700]   I mean, whatever the chip is called.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.820]   I've been looking at it because I have to write a review like everybody else does for
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.900]   when it's actually public and I've been looking at the screenshots on Apple and watching the
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:19.220]   videos and looking at the betas and it's they have done tremendous work.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.660]   Some of those screens are just so beautiful.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.260]   I literally sit there staring at them sometimes.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.020]   I think people got confused, not confused, but I think they were distracted by the icons
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.340]   on the home screen and haven't had a chance to look at the entire OS yet.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.620]   But literally not a pixel is the same.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.540]   They've redone everything from top to bottom and it's some amazing work.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.780]   If you love frosted glass, you'll love iOS 7.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:47.260]   Well, and that's the problem that a lot of people getting distracted, they're getting
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.860]   distracted by what are very, very big visual differences without, but people really need
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.380]   to understand that this isn't a case of simply freshening up the user interface.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.460]   This is their first, it's as close to a do over as Apple, I think we'll ever do a
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.460]   iOS.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.220]   It's the idea that we are now several years wiser.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.740]   We've had several tens of millions of users worth of experience to draw on.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:14.780]   And also we've grown as creators and as a company on what our goals are going to be
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.500]   for the next five years.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.780]   And rather than go the windows route, which is to keep bolting on, bolting on, bolting
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:29.020]   on, it's time for us to now reinvent this and remaster it for another generation of users.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.580]   Is that big?
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:36.460]   Craig Hawk and Barry, who is at the icon factory, did an informal poll of iOS developers and
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:42.740]   95% of those who responded said we are going to update apps to not only be compatible with
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:47.860]   I presume cosmetically and physically, but also to take advantage with of iOS 7 features,
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.860]   95%.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.020]   No, that's the excitement.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:57.900]   I think that a lot of developers got whiplash between iOS 6 and iOS 7 between all the disappointment
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.660]   and heartbreak and hurt, genuine hurt that they've experienced with iOS 6, particularly
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:08.220]   with iCloud versus iOS 7, where lots of problems that they've been grappling with for a couple
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.980]   of years are now very, very easy to implement and execute in iOS 7 now.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.420]   And also let's not forget that when Apple proudly talks about the lumber developers who
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.660]   are updating their apps for iOS 7, realize that there's a built-in time bomb that it's
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.140]   like all run.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.060]   It's like Apple's telling everybody, now, don't worry, old developers who don't want
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:33.300]   to lift a finger to take advantage of our new lovely iOS 7 who want to stay complacent
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.900]   and not expend that minimal amount of effort that almost anybody would certainly want
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.900]   to do.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:44.460]   Your iOS 6 apps will run just fine on modified on iOS 7 and to make sure they run perfectly
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.500]   fine, we're going to make sure they look like crappy iOS 6 apps.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:53.900]   You're well, this is interesting because in the same poll, 48%, almost half of the developers
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.940]   said we are not going to offer backward compatibility.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:04.420]   If you start implementing iOS 7 features, you may actually make an effect, a new app that
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   is not compatible.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.500]   That's the biggest challenge.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.500]   It's a big challenge.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:14.220]   Now, iOS 7 will not run on any of the first three iPhone models up through the 3GS or
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.180]   any of the iPod touches except the fifth generation.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.940]   I'm not sure with the iPad situation.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.420]   iPad 2 and all that.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   Two and up.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.260]   You can't do it on the first iPad application.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.300]   So the people who have that older hardware may not only are not only going to be left
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.380]   out in the cold with iOS 7, they may be left out in the cold with some of their apps.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.940]   Yeah, but how old is the 3GS at this point?
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   It's old.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:45.380]   Although, I remember it was free in the store, a lot of people got up until 2012.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.620]   Yeah, last year.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.860]   So some people say, "Oh, I want a free phone.
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   Got a 3GS."
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.100]   But the old apps will still work for as long as...
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   Because he was wrong that time.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.100]   Right.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.100]   Just don't update.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.100]   But you can't.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.100]   You can't.
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:04.660]   And to be realistic, if you either A got the 3GS when it was brand new, was it four years
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.060]   ago, three years ago?
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   Three years ago, I think.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.220]   Then probably you're due for a new phone anyway.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.620]   If you got the 3GS last year because it was the free phone, you're probably not in the
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.540]   business of spending hundreds of dollars on apps.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.380]   So you probably don't have a lot of investment in there anyway.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.580]   And also, this is a very positive...
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:26.980]   It's a very Apple move that can do things that are very, very positive for the platform.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.820]   They're not afraid to simply say that we cannot keep supporting every old user.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.820]   No.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.820]   Apple's famous.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.820]   You're not doing that.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.820]   Well, I wouldn't say they're famous.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.020]   No, because I have Macs that are still in service years and years and years after.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.420]   A Windows machine would have been taken to the recycling center.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.500]   Yeah, but don't put IPs on it.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.460]   That's just a good rule in general.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:51.060]   But I'm saying that at some point, if you really want to keep control of your platform
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.900]   and control the platform, includes the ability to keep improving that platform.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.620]   At some point, you have to tell somebody that be very, very happy with your phone as it
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:02.660]   was in 2012 because that hardware, that operating system, and that software will continue to
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.500]   run in that combination as long as electrons can course through those circuit trees.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:11.780]   But as soon as you want to put in a new operating system or a new piece of software on there,
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.540]   that's the point of the program to say, you got four years out of this phone.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.780]   You got five years, six years out of this computer.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:24.380]   We kept this basic operating system intact from 2007 until 2013.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.940]   And now after six years, we are okay with breaking with the old and moving forward with
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.220]   the new.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:34.700]   That's exactly the verbiage I've been using for years with PCs.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.180]   Yeah, your PC is going to run exactly as it did that they came from the factory.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.500]   If you don't put anything new on it, that's right.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.700]   The early it was the, and Craig Hockenberry's partner, Gideon Mayhew, did a very interesting
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:49.820]   blog post a couple of weeks earlier where he was explaining how much effort these companies,
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.420]   I mean, they're redoing, they just redid Twitterific five and they're redoing it from
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   scratch.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.500]   It's basically a new app.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.420]   And people are not going to be willing to pay for that kind of an update.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.940]   So they basically have to do all this work for free and you scale that across all the
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.220]   apps because they're going to want to be in the app store the first day.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.460]   Taking time to do the redesign takes time away from adding new features that people
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.740]   would pay for.
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.900]   So it becomes an expensive proposition for developers with no real clear idea on how
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.100]   to pay for all that stuff.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.580]   And that was a lot of the herd of iOS six there's the Apple force developers do a lot
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:26.260]   of work that was productive and intense work, but did nothing to fuel the engines of empire,
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.260]   so to speak.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.060]   It did nothing to put more money in their pocket and yet they still had to pay their developers
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:36.340]   and use limited resources to pretty much just maintain parity with what they had before.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:42.140]   But it's so you know, but the other factor about this is that the iOS community and the
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.740]   Mac community, they're people who understand the idea of novelty, of new features and moving
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.740]   things forward.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.420]   One of the reasons I think one of the reasons why Windows eight has been getting so much
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.940]   so much drumming over the past year is not because it's a poor operating system.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.340]   I think it's a very, very good OS, but the Windows community is not a community that wants
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.100]   something that works better or new.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.860]   They want they just want that rental car that where this the gear shift is right where it
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:08.860]   is the radio station.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.220]   So exactly where they are.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.660]   It's easy to get at the air conditioning.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.540]   You put the key in it starts and after that don't give me anything that's going to confuse
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.100]   me or force me to learn anything new.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.500]   So that's another advantage of buying it to the Apple ecosystem.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.020]   It's a community of people that are going to if they have access to Tumblr and Twitter,
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.620]   they will kick up a Royal Fury because you change the shape of their sharing button,
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.620]   but they're on the whole.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.380]   They're okay with being discomforted for about a week.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:38.700]   If it means that two weeks later, they feel as they no longer have that sort of that sort
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.740]   of absolute that sort of abject longing they might have had for a certain feature they found
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.660]   in a Windows phone or a certain feature they found in an Android device.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:52.620]   So long as it keeps iOS vibrant and vital and a step ahead of everybody else, a penny
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.180]   of pain, a pound of comfort.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.460]   So Andy, you got a Moto X on Thursday.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.540]   Is there anything you see in this phone like say, for instance, the, I mean, they did some
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.180]   really interesting hardware support.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.180]   Lots.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:08.180]   Always on.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180]   Lots.
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.180]   Always listening without depleting the battery.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.940]   The battery life's very good.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.340]   Even though it's fairly small battery.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:18.380]   Do you see anything in that phone that Apple's going to have to set up and pay attention to?
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:22.340]   That's the phone in the other room I could show you.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.860]   Just the thing that I'm loving about it over the past five days is just the ability that
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.940]   because of the OLED screen, it can keep pixels alive without burning through the battery.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.820]   And the ability to simply take it out of the pocket your pocket and instantly get information.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.740]   Mostly I'm talking about the information that says, no, there's no need for me to wake this
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:40.740]   up.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   I know what time it is or be there are no notifications on the screen that make me think that, oh,
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   gee, there's something going on.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.740]   I need to check about.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.740]   Take it out of the pocket and I don't see my mail message light lit up or other apps lit
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   up.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.580]   I can put it right back in my pocket and it works just fine and not even have to bother
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.700]   to not even bother to unlock it or wake it up.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:05.580]   Also the, the other gesture I'm using a lot is just the ability to, you know, you want
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.580]   to take a picture.
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.260]   How many taps do you have to go through?
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.820]   How many taps and swipes on any phone, including the iPhone 5 before you get a working camera?
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:18.660]   The iPhone 5 is probably near the top of the heat because it does put the camera as a slider
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.780]   on the, on the lock screen, but that's still a whole bunch of things you have to do before
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.700]   you actually have a waiting camera with a Moto X.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:29.460]   Again, it has one process that does nothing but listen, but understand the context that
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.940]   you're about to use it in so it can light up exactly the moment you need it.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.420]   So if you just take out of your pocket and give it, give it like a twisty shake.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.420]   I'll show you it.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.740]   By the time, by the time you hold up to your face, it's, it's a camera that's ready to go.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.180]   You just go like this and then you can take a picture within seconds.
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.260]   Now admittedly, it's not as good as the iPhone 5.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.220]   I don't think the camera's, I wouldn't say so.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.220]   It tops the line.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.300]   It's kind of mitts around it.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.020]   It's an adequate, it's a, it's a, it's a very, exactly a very adequate camera.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.220]   Which is not something you put us, you know, forced art.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.220]   It's an idea.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.860]   It's an absolute, one and a half thumbs up.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.940]   But the fact that you can launch it so fast is in some ways a, a makes up for the fact
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.180]   that it's not the greatest camera in the world because I could get pictures that I would
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.580]   just wouldn't get any other way.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.820]   Yeah, I just, I just have to say that just that ability to give me information without
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.700]   having to wake up the phone completely, that's a huge thing.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.540]   It's just, it's so, it's something that I use several times a day and I appreciate several
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.540]   times a day.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:27.580]   The ability to know that the battery level is low without having to wake it up and why
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.580]   isn't it waking up?
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.540]   Oh, that's because I forgot to turn it.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.780]   That's, that's because I was using it a hell of a lot and I haven't charged it in two
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.500]   days and now the battery's dead.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.180]   It's no, you see that little red icon with a battery that's really, really just crying
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.780]   and whimpering and begging and pleading me, but that means I should plug it in.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:46.740]   Does Apple start to have to look at what Siri's doing in the face of Google now and the face
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.700]   of always listening and start to pay attention to this?
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:54.660]   I mean, one of the advantages Motorola had, they kind of stealth this is that they were
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.700]   able to redesign the hardware to support this feature.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.740]   It's not like you could just turn it on in any other phone.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   But it's a feature.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   It's a feature.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   It's a feature.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:08.300]   I'm, the, the, the thing about the Moto X is that it is more of a promise to me than a
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.740]   product because it's, it's kind of like it looks like it's delayed.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   It's kind of old hardware.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.820]   They had to kind of Frankenstein the processor, but everything coming after this is sounds
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.460]   like it's going to have all this built in.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.380]   So it's just going to be a feature that doesn't require everything, all the heavy lifting
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.020]   Moto did, but the new chipsets will just work with always listening and just, well, that's
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.020]   interesting.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.020]   So you think so.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.340]   So maybe an I seven will or an A seven will.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   It's a companion course.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.820]   As far as I understand it and I'm like, I still get in.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:39.620]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's a dual core S four pro, the arm chip.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.060]   There's quad core adreno GPUs.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   They really focus.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.060]   Yes.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.500]   What it is is, and this is what Apple's done for years.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.620]   They designed the hardware to support what they wanted the software to do.
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.820]   And then it has two DSPs for natural language, always listening.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.620]   And I'm not sure where the accelerometer goes.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:00.380]   I'm not sure if it's, if it's what part of the phone is watching the accelerometer, but
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.900]   it, but it's true that it does not deplete the battery.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.900]   No.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.660]   Yeah, I mean, I have not, I was prepared for there to be a big cost to this.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:13.340]   And no, it's one of the, in terms of user facing battery life, it's one of the longest
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.140]   lasting devices that I've, that I've, Android devices that I've used.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   It's very iPhone.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.580]   There, there are like 18 hours in my, in my last four days.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.140]   I mean, it's, it's very, it's very iPhone like to me in a lot of ways.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.980]   A part of one of them being the fact that I don't worry about battery life as much as
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.540]   I do with other Android phones.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.260]   Well, that's why I bring it up because I think this is naturally going after that more than
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:40.340]   a lot of Android phones kind of going after the iPhone crowd, but in design as well as
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.340]   software.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.180]   I do wish that they would be more like when Apple States, you know, 10 hours of battery
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.380]   life, they mean that you're, you're, you're either doing wifi or watching a video for
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.380]   10 hours.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.220]   A lot of other manufacturers will say 24 hours of battery life.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.020]   That's assuming you're sleeping for eight of them.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.140]   And Andy gets like, Andy give the realistic figure for that battery life.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.140]   It's just we get these questions.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.260]   Oh, how come Apple's not doing 24 hours of battery life?
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.260]   Well, no organics.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.260]   No one is.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.780]   It's just they're mis, they're not, they're stating the figures using a different measure
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.180]   and that creates confusion.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:13.940]   I should bet you because the number of people in the chat are all a, a Twitter about this.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.940]   During the Twitch show, it kept waking up and I had trained it with a strange cartoon
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.740]   voice and I'm not sure what was going on, but I haven't, I retrained it with my normal
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:25.260]   voice and I haven't had to do that ever again.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:29.260]   So I'm not sure why and I've been, it's been out, you know, was out on the table through
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.260]   most of this show.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.980]   I don't understand why it was turning on myself.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.340]   That was just a weird artifact.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.420]   It does not as far as I could tell do that normal.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.460]   For my review, I've been playing with a lot.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.100]   There's a phrase I'm trying to fine tune because it doesn't really work in the current
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:45.620]   draft, but you know, you know, the old joke about how in paradise, all the police officers
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.780]   or the police officers are all, are all English.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:49.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.500]   The chefs are all Italian.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   I think that in the, I'm impressed enough with the Moto X. I know that the phone version
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.380]   of that joke, Moto X is in there somewhere as they do something, they do certain things
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:03.940]   so well that you want part of that in every, in every, in every phone that's out there.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:08.140]   And one of the, one of the other interesting aspects, this does affect this, this does impact
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:14.940]   like the iPhone is that when I review the iPhone 5, like everybody else, of course, I
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.940]   had to talk about how beautiful it was and how slim it was and how glad it was, but then
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.220]   you have to take a deep breath and say, and that will make all the difference in the world
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.300]   for about four days until someone's, the owner's package from Amazon comes and they put the
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.740]   $11 silicone rubber case over it, which everybody does because everybody wants to either, they
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.780]   tell them, they tell themselves they want to protect their phone, but really what they
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.820]   want to do is personalize that phone.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.180]   So it doesn't really, in the end, it almost doesn't matter what a phone looks like because
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.460]   someone's going to put it in a case.
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:48.020]   I really think that that's sort of like the, the stealth device, the stealth weapon is
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.020]   the customized, the customizability of the Moto X because people want a phone that looks
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:56.340]   exactly the way they want it to and the ability to put any combination of colors for three
[00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:00.020]   different components of the, of the, of this device.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:06.220]   That's for people who are firmly in the, that, that consumer category where I believe that
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:11.300]   these seven phones, including the iPhone and, and, and six others are each of these could
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.900]   do as well as each other as what I want a phone to do.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.060]   You mean that this one, I can have it in pink, silver and, and orange?
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060]   Great.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.740]   I'll get the one in pink, silver and orange.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740]   But I can't have it today.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.220]   So just give me the black one on the shelf.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.420]   Well, you can't have it at all in Canada.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:29.340]   Well, I think Roger's is going to get it, but I think the car stuff is all exclusive to
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340]   AT&T.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340]   If I wrote it, yeah.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.860]   And, you know, Motorola was coy about how long that exclusivity lasts.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   It may be a month.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.860]   It may not be a real one.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.660]   I think I really, I really think that that's a way for them to ramp up there to get the
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.820]   final squirrels out of their, their procedure for doing that four day shipping.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.460]   I don't think that's going to be a lifetime AT&T exclusive.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460]   Oh, God.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.260]   I think that, I think that it's going to be as soon as they reel, they get a handle on
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:55.100]   here's how well the system can actually handle real consumers with their, with, with their
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.100]   demands.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.660]   That's when they know how they're going to have to scale it up and when they, how they
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.660]   can adapt the process.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.660]   I don't think that's going to be exclusive.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:04.700]   No, no, they said it's not going to be a permanent exclusive.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.700]   It's a short term.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.700]   Right.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.700]   They always listening to me.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.900]   Leo is really interesting because we've talked before about, you know, Google now
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.460]   in many ways is very far ahead of Siri and Google controls, their own technology.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:19.540]   They can do things like put it on board so that the, a lot of the voice parsing happens
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   on device.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.580]   Well, all of series has to go to the internet.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.980]   They can do this always listening.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.060]   And it'll be interesting to see what Apple does with that because they are licensed from
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:28.060]   nuance.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.740]   They are, you know, in Andy's backyard building their own voice technical center.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.140]   But how far ahead will that be?
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:37.580]   And will an A7 processor include separate co-processors to handle things like this?
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.380]   Is it something Apple is able to do given the technology they have access to and is something
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.380]   that they want to do?
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.180]   And I think, you know, we do this year that or next year, they'll have to answer that
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.180]   question.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180]   Right.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.380]   And Apple is already, already a couple steps ahead of Google in, in a couple of important
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.380]   ways.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.260]   Because Google now is fantastic.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.780]   You can do that magic, that magical thing.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.540]   Like the first time that you have Google down your phone and you travel and you get off
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.540]   the plane and you reflexively, I need to know like where to go for this.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.820]   I need to know when my next appointment is.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820]   I need to go.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.180]   And then you wake it up and say, oh, there are exactly information that I wanted exactly
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.260]   at the time when it makes sense for me to have it.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.260]   Okay, then.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260]   Well done.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:19.460]   But Siri, Siri is a lot more accommodating and it's a lot more, it helps.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.740]   It does a much stronger way of forging an emotional connection to the product because
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.340]   you actually have a conversation with Siri.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:30.260]   You don't remember with Google now you have to, you can certainly add an item to your calendar,
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.780]   but you have to phrase it in exactly the right way.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.340]   It's very Pivishness like, like Alex Trebek.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.980]   And then if you don't, if you put an extra S in there, it will tell you, I'm sorry, I
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.460]   can't accept that question.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.300]   But with Siri, you can say, I like to schedule an appointment and then it will walk you through
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.100]   okay when.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.500]   And if you raise a number of different ways, it will walk you through it.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.380]   It's more of an interface to an entirely new user.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:58.660]   It's more of a way to interact with an entirely new user interface for many applications than
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.100]   simply a control panel that tries to put the right information in front of you when you
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.100]   want it.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.900]   And I think that's, Annie nails it absolutely there because it shows the difference in those
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900]   companies.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.980]   Siri is almost like a Pixar character where Google now has a lot of interesting functionality.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.340]   One absolutely nails the service and the other absolutely nails the experience and we could
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.900]   just get them closer together so they could breed.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.220]   It would be fantastic.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:24.340]   Does it, does it, I think, I think, I think you've actually, you've actually put your,
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.500]   this is going to be like the next big Pixar movie.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.580]   We'll have like, where they're two worrying factions like Siri is the, is the princess
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:37.220]   of, of Apple land and, and Gordon Noli is the, is the prince of Google and they, they,
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.700]   they mustn't be together and get their drawn together by love and by the, their, their mutual
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.980]   desire to serve users if only their, their, their stupid brutish king and queen, which
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:51.660]   simply stopped fighting and let them be like SEGA.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.940]   Let's see.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.340]   Which, which, which one?
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.620]   You're going to keep giving the, given that I've just come back from two days at a comic
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.020]   card and I've got me thinking, okay, which character would be who I think?
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.020]   Which one has wings?
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.020]   Which one has horns?
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.020]   Horns.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:13.020]   So yeah, I mean, I, I, when I look at the Moto X, I feel like this is the phone that
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.140]   is aimed right at the iPhone audience in the iPhone market.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:21.300]   And I think that people going into AT&T in particular, but into other stars will be kind
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.380]   of looking at the side by side.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.740]   Now it remains to be seen whether the phone companies push them at all.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.740]   Because that's one problem.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.740]   Windows phone.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.740]   Windows.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.740]   And marketing money, Leo.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.740]   And some of that money's going to go to AT&T salespeople.
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.980]   And, and I mean, you're, you're writing that there's a lot of iPhone influence there.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:45.180]   I was talking, I had some meetings with senior Motorola executives after, after the event.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.340]   And we're just having a conversation not about tech stuff, but about like thoughts and processes.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:56.180]   And they were saying they were, they really spoke very, very convincingly about how when
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.660]   they were bought out by Google, they felt as though they wanted to take a step back and
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.620]   figure out, you know, instead of a company that makes 60 different phones, we want to
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   have a purpose.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.940]   You know, we want to, we want to have some, some of the things that we want to do.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.260]   Some, some, some ideals that we're going to be working towards.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.900]   And that this, then they spoke, they speak of the Moto X as the first, I mean, paraphrasing
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.340]   heavily to for comedic effect, but it's not, not completely untrue to say that this is
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.500]   the first one.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.540]   First one, the Motorola has, has made since they had a set of ideals on a purpose in mind.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.540]   Right.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:29.020]   I'm going to be in a quandary because I now have a update for, you know, I've crossed
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.100]   the two year threshold on one of my AT&T phones.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.940]   And I, they also sell the Lumia 1020.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   I guess, I got to say that this is, this is a hard, hard year.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:44.580]   It's, it's, I'm waiting till the iPhone comes out because it will really come down to Moto
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.220]   X, Lumia 1020 or iPhones 5S.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.860]   I'm keen to see what all the rumors so far and my rumor sources are nowhere as good as
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:59.940]   Renee's or 9 to 5 Max, but we haven't been hearing a lot about a revolutionary new phone,
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.460]   but they can do a lot in the same casing by changing how they do their signal processing,
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.020]   changing their, their processing architecture.
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.540]   But I'm not so far, we're not seeing something that will be so big that it would turn your
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:16.100]   head away from, well, how about this phone that has the greatest camera ever put inside?
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:21.940]   Not just a phone, but a compact, compact sized camera or this phone, which does not ruin
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.820]   the, the Android experience, lest you customize it and is really, really useful, even when
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.220]   you're not even waking it up.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:34.220]   Do you, it's like, could I do without an iPhone for a two year, for two years?
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.420]   If this would have been a, this would have been a wonderful year for Apple to have and
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:44.140]   just as we revolutionized iOS six by making iOS seven, we felt it was time for a new revolution
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.380]   in phone hardware.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.900]   That's the, this is the perfect time to make people not even, people have already forgotten
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.940]   about, about the Galaxy S4.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.700]   It wasn't a really good update.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:59.180]   It was, I've already given, given my to I as I was a disappointment.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.100]   I mean, I was from, from even from the, even from the first time I held that anything that,
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.540]   okay, it's fine, but who cares?
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:11.220]   I mean, if, but they, but they have two or three competitors now that are just so solid,
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:16.580]   just the ability to get a contour, to get a very, very close to a pure Android experience
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:21.420]   without having to buy an unlocked phone for $650 and get it out of contract price.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.260]   That alone is a very, very big step for Android.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.500]   So I'm, I'm really keen to see what Apple will do.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:32.340]   I don't think they ever do anything in response to anything, but when they are designing the
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:36.860]   next, choosing the priorities for the next big revision to the iPhone, and now they're
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:43.980]   doing it in an environment that has this level of competition to it, I'm curious to see what,
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.580]   what decisions they're going to be putting into, into that new hardware.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.780]   I'd love to see a thick phone with a camera that even kicks the Nokia's X.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.620]   Ah, and what's interesting too though, is that the market is growing so big now, more
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.140]   and more regular phone users are becoming smartphone users.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:02.180]   So more and more smartphones are just becoming phones for people that you'll start to see
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:05.940]   niches appear the way they, they do for any other widespread consumer product.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.740]   I know the Kin tried that, but it was way too early, I think.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.140]   And now you have the 1020, which, you know, it's not really a mainstream phone.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.320]   It's more of a phone that, you know, you need a smartphone, but you love cameras and
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.900]   otherwise maybe you'll get the 925 instead.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:22.820]   And I think we'll slowly see more of those and then where Apple exists with a unified product,
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.700]   or maybe one or two or three products in a world where Samsung is putting out.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.260]   However many in Nokia is putting out, however many I think becomes interesting as well.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.620]   I think that, I think that's a little bit skewed though.
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.700]   I think that the reason why we're seeing more smartphone users is a percentage of the total
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:40.180]   population is that we're seeing more smartphones that cost so, such little money that you can
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.300]   just go ahead and get there.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:46.500]   I think there's a, there's a, the, the silent, the silent, the huge portion of the phone market
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.700]   are people who I just want to walk out with a working phone.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.700]   Why would I spend $200 on something that I don't use?
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.940]   I don't feel as though I use as much as, as kind of justify a $200 expense.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.620]   But if you put, if you put a, what two years ago or a year ago would have been a $200 smartphone
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.220]   at the price of a $50 flip phone two years ago, sure, they'll walk out with an Android
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.220]   event.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.020]   It's probably going to be an Android device because they're so inexpensive.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.020]   Right.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.980]   That's also what's, what's skewing the numbers I think on Android uptake.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:14.980]   Oh yeah.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.980]   You're getting people, you're getting people who are now Android users, but they don't
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.060]   care that it's Android.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.540]   They just care that, okay, great.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.540]   I got games.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.140]   I've got, I've got a camera on my Facebook.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   I've got Facebook.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.140]   Exactly.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   I've got Instagram.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   But that's really true.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.380]   I mean, at some point from a normal user, it really does.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.180]   It's the distinctions are minimal.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.180]   You don't, you don't, we as geeks pay a lot more attention to this distinctions than
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.180]   real people probably do.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   Absolutely.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:44.500]   And that, that's what's kind of informing my, my, my, my, my Lumia 1020 review is so
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.980]   late or so much later than I thought I, that I, that I, you thought you were going to have
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.300]   it done last week.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:53.420]   And the, and the reason why I was hell, I was holding off and taking more pictures with
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.260]   it is that I was just so in love with this camera, I really needed the stars to fall
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.940]   from my eyes before I felt I could write things that were valuable about it.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.540]   But one of the, one of the other problems is that do people care about taking phenomenally
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:09.700]   good photos with their camera phone is good enough, good enough is, is it's, is it's, and
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.340]   given that this phone costs $299, which is a hundred bucks more than what every other
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.460]   really good smartphone is, is, is charging these days.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.540]   You have to have people who are motivated to want that kind of quality.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.860]   And as much as I feel as though part of our jobs as, you know, as commentators and writers
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:31.900]   and pundits is to, you know, to tell these, to tell the consumer that you're not dumb,
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.780]   you're not unsophisticated is that it's just that we spend 10 hours a day thinking about
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.780]   this.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.460]   You spend 10, 10, 10 hours a year when you're, when your phone craps out on you.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.580]   And we, we would just like to gently say that there might be some things you would really,
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.260]   really like to have that you haven't even considered right now.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.020]   It's just as possible for someone to say, look, I want to go back into the store where I got
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.940]   my last phone, where I got my contract at.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.380]   I'm not going to switch carriers.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.660]   I'm just going to look for the phone.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.420]   This as the most similar to the one that I already have, that costs the least amount
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.060]   of money that I can, that I can spend.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:05.060]   And if it's got a, if it's got a free fruit flavored case with it, I will take the fruit
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.060]   flavored case and that will make my, my buying decision for me.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.060]   It's a cool camera, please.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.980]   At least think of, I know it's Windows phone.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.420]   I know it's Windows phone, but that's kind of a deal killer for me.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.420]   You're right.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.100]   No, that's why I love it in the radio show because it really brings me back to Earth
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.100]   with normal people.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.660]   For six hours a week, I talk to normal people and I have to freight, I have to really couch
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.300]   everything I say with that in mind.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:33.860]   You know, I can't say, well, you really want the S for pro quad core.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.100]   You know, that Qualcomm 800 is very excited.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.100]   That's that dragon.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.100]   You can't say that.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   Let's talk about application address space for a lot of people.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:47.660]   You have to say, oh, you're going to like this phone because it's really fast to get to
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   the camera.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.340]   Things like that are what matter to people.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:57.500]   Actually, maybe this is telling maybe not Apple just or recently bought a passive, which
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.820]   is a Silicon Valley based wireless chip developer.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.100]   They make chips that use very little power.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.780]   They include including a radio that works with Bluetooth, Elle, low energy.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.740]   That's what your Fitbit flex works with.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:18.220]   Perhaps for, I mean, one would think for an eye watch for a fitness or a health monitoring
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:24.780]   feature and I watch, but maybe they can stick that in the phone too, you know?
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.540]   Bluetooth, Elle is really cool.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.460]   The future is all about low power, Leo.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.460]   Well, that's clear.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.300]   Just everything you can do with that technology.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:37.180]   And every time I talk to a manufacturer of any sort of a mobile device, at some point,
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.980]   Bluetooth, Elle comes to the conversation either in something that they and usually not in
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:45.260]   something that's available right now, but they do a lot of wink, wink, nudge, nudge,
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.260]   saying that.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:50.340]   And we've decided to implement this version of Bluetooth in case we want to use a certain
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:57.500]   super hyper location based or super personal networking grid sort of solution sometime
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.500]   in the next year.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.780]   It's like nobody wants to be left on the curb for this.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.900]   They'll just come with a list of everything you could do with that technology and you just
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.620]   run out of paper before you run out of ideas.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:16.220]   The number of phones that are compatible with the Bluetooth Elle is fairly low.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:20.500]   I know that because of the Fitbit Flex, that's what it needs to support it.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   The Lumia's do...
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   Oh, that's 1.3, I'll think so.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   The Galaxy's do...
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.220]   In fact, the Galaxy's have since S3.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:31.860]   BlackBerry does, HTC One does, iPhone does...
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]   Do they?
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.860]   That's wrong, I think.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.860]   I think so.
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:35.860]   Does it?
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:36.860]   Yeah, that's on 5, I think.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:37.860]   5 does.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.500]   But it's a short list.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.740]   And that's probably not at this point.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.100]   The reason is because it's not at this point.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.060]   People aren't aware of it, but I think soon they will be.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:54.460]   Next year, there are going to be so many devices that will change the way that a phone works.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:14:00.140]   If that phone supports Elle, I don't think that it's going to be like a phone not supporting
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:04.380]   high-speed Wi-Fi or a phone not supporting audio over Wi-Fi.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.380]   Excuse me, audio over Bluetooth.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:10.900]   It's just going to be something that is just going to come up with everything.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.900]   Okay.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.500]   I think we have covered all the big stories.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.500]   You want to...
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.940]   Anything else you guys want to get in there before we take our break?
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.940]   FaceTime commercial, Leo.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:20.940]   Oh, you want to...
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.140]   It pulls your heartstrings.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.740]   All right, all right.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.300]   And I didn't play, notice, the commercial...
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.180]   Nokia Nokia, as they say in the commercial.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.140]   Is running to counter the iPhone picture commercial.
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.140]   Let me...
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.140]   We'll do the FaceTime.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.380]   They're going to have to do a Skype one now.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.420]   Skype will have to do one.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.420]   If I go to apple.com/ads...
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:45.420]   Or the youtube.com/apple.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.420]   There you go.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   Let's do it that way.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   That's probably faster.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:55.620]   I'm trying to decide between the 925 and the 1020 and the all asking.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.460]   925 is beautiful, too.
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.660]   The 1020 is a small screen, you know?
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.620]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.820]   It started playing right away.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.940]   Let me go full screen.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.260]   You think Apple will pull this show because we do this?
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.260]   No.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:14.660]   It's not unusual to go out at any time.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.860]   I'm trying to mess up the audio so they can't key it.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:17.860]   It's not unusual.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:18.860]   They pull it.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:19.860]   They pull it.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.380]   So, this got a bunch.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.380]   It's all...
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.580]   Aw, he blew a kiss to their girlfriend.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.980]   It's like the camera and the music commercial before.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:33.340]   Yeah, the first, the only thing I think about this is I never see anybody using FaceTime.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.340]   It's nice.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:41.300]   These are all people using FaceTime to talk to loved ones to show them fireworks displays.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.100]   They're in FaceTime.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.660]   Planet Apple commercial, Landon.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.020]   Yeah, it's a different world.
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.500]   You know, two days ago, my little godchildren who are four and seven years old, FaceTimed
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.700]   me from their traveling and they were at a dinosaur dig and they wanted to FaceTime and
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.700]   show it to me.
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   It was pretty awesome.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.700]   Aw, she's pregnant.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.700]   Aw.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.700]   She's six months along and you didn't know?
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.700]   Wow.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.700]   You didn't notice that?
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.620]   I have something to tell you, honey.
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:14.620]   I very rarely see people using that.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.940]   Well, I rarely see people using Skype video either.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.460]   I just did a Google Hangout with video for the first, you know, the new Hangouts where
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.140]   it's just like...
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.020]   So you've got Google doing it, you've got Apple doing it, you've got Skype doing it.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.340]   A lot of companies doing it.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:34.740]   But I think there's less demand for video calls than anybody ever thought.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.460]   I don't know why.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:38.780]   It just doesn't seem like there's a lot of demand for that.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   I don't know.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.540]   The people who use it really use it a lot.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.540]   I mean, I'm...
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.540]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.540]   I'll go into this.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:48.500]   It's like it really is the glue that is holding extended families together.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.740]   I mean, I visit my 83, 83 and 84-year-old a aunts.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.460]   Like they have...
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460]   The reason why...
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.220]   A lot of the reason why one of them bought a new computer is because a role computer
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.220]   wouldn't run Skype.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.660]   And with Skype, she gets to see all of her grandchildren every night.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.660]   Right.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.700]   I mean, everyone at WWDC runs home to FaceTime.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   They're kids after the sessions.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700]   Oh, really?
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700]   [laughter]
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.460]   But the interesting thing with iOS 7 and they announced this is there's going to be FaceTime
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460]   audio.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.460]   So you don't have to just do a video call.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.300]   It's going to be their entry into voice over IP.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.180]   And it'll be Apple only, but people have been asking for that feature for a long time.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.780]   That's the big problem with FaceTime.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.780]   It has to be Apple.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.260]   So if you use Skype, it's cross-platform.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.700]   If you use Google Hangout, it's cross-platform.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.700]   It's multi-platform.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:31.860]   A lot of them like Google Hangouts.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.540]   They still don't think it's on Windows Phone or Blackberry yet.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   You don't call anybody who has Windows Phone or Blackberry.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540]   [laughter]
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.540]   They haven't earned the platform label yet.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.540]   Nick Damon here.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.100]   chatroom says it's very big in the Asian culture.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.060]   So it may be cultural.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.660]   Remember text messaging did not take off in the US.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:54.940]   It happened overseas first and became huge in England and Asia.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:59.980]   And then we caught on and a few years later, it became just as big here.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.940]   So maybe that's just a cultural thing.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:08.220]   Does that have more to do with how difficult the difference in sending text messaging and
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.220]   non-Roman languages?
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.220]   Well, maybe.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220]   Maybe SMS.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.220]   Well, it was inexpensive.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.940]   It was expensive and not interoperable for a long time.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.580]   Well, and that's what hurt SMS.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.580]   You have very much like FaceTime.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   It wasn't interoperable.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.300]   You had to have somebody who had the same carrier for you to text message each other.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.420]   Or perhaps in Asian cultures, they don't spend quite so much time worrying about their hair
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.660]   as we do in the West.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.980]   Well, that's it.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.980]   That's for sure.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.620]   I almost went hatless today and then put the headphones on.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.620]   Okay, my hair is doing weird stuff.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.740]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at audible.com.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.300]   Audio books are a lifesaver.
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.460]   I was listening last night.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.460]   It's how I go to sleep.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.220]   It's how I drive when I commute.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.940]   It's how I do the dishes and work out in the gym.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.260]   It's great because it brought books back into my life.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.740]   For a long time, I just didn't have time to read.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:03.300]   Or I would start reading in bed and I would get a quarter of a page through and it'd be
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.300]   over.
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.180]   It's hard to get through a book at a quarter of pages at a time.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.900]   When I discovered audio books, I think it was 2000.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.060]   I subscribed to audible for the first time.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.060]   Changed my life.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.060]   Changed my life.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.060]   I just love audible.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.300]   I've been telling people about it ever since.

[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.580]   What are you listening to now?
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.620]   Andy, Andy always has great recommendations.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.220]   Actually, I'm revisiting a greatest hit because somebody on Twitter asked me, "Hey, what
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:05.140]   was that book that you recommended a while ago about this spy true life that World War
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.140]   II made?"
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.140]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.620]   It reminded me of one of my favorite audible books ever.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:14.820]   It's called Operation Mincemeat, which is a true story of espionage from World War II
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:23.460]   in which the allies were going to be invading Sicily, but they needed to convince the Nazis
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.540]   that the Germans that they were going to be invading Greece.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.700]   I might have the reverse, but whatever.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.740]   That's right.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.220]   As part of the counter, the disinformation program, someone came up with this idea saying, "Well,
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.700]   we need to really convince them this is going to happen."
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:44.620]   What if we get a dead guy and dress him up as a British officer and put papers on secret
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:50.780]   papers on him that are like private communications, private letters among the allies indicating
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:54.620]   where the invasion is going to go?
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:21:02.540]   And then we just drop them off the ocean near where the Germans are, fake a plane landing
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:07.220]   and create the impression that this guy was on a top secret intelligence mission.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.500]   And oh my God, what luck we've happened to have found these papers that tell us where
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.860]   their private secret invasion plans are.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.740]   Already, it's a good idea.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.820]   And then the only way I could increase how cool this story is.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:23.620]   Now imagine the person who people who came up with this plan are implementing this had
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:29.380]   read way, way too many spy thrillers and thought that, "Well, if we can't just dress
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:32.060]   a guy up, we have to give him a back story.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:36.740]   So let's visit the tailor where he would have shopped at and make sure we have some shirts
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.740]   made for him.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.020]   We'll have to go to a theater, get some tickets.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.820]   Oh, but where is he going to the theater with?
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.380]   Ah, he must have had a girlfriend.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.980]   So let's have this guy, this girl from the typing pool pose as his girlfriend will take
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.980]   some pictures of her, put that in his wallet.
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:55.900]   It shows you what a whole bunch of weird people doing an impossible plan can actually have
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:22:01.860]   success in the end because it's not as though the Germans redirected all their truths because
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:05.140]   they found this dead guy, but that certainly was a factor in it.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:10.460]   And as bizarre and as unlikely and as crazy as it was, this plan actually worked.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:14.220]   I read a book many years ago when I was, I think it was a school called The Man Who
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.220]   Never Was.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.460]   This is the same story, but this is a much, I have to say this is much better written.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.460]   It's crazy.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:24.460]   One of the people was like the, the, the, the person, I think the president of the international
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:31.500]   ping pong appreciation, Federation Society, other, other people had been, other, other
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:37.660]   of these officers had been picked up wearing ladies, ladies clothing and arrested, but
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.060]   then quietly like, why don't we just forget this never happened and we'll put you back
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.060]   into service.
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.260]   It was, it's like the, that's, I'm waiting for like the deathbed confession of this author
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:50.980]   who said that no, I just met the person, the person who, the person who told me the story
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.500]   told me later on he made it all up.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.100]   Yeah, it does seem like that doesn't it?
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.540]   It was, it was too good a story to fact check.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.540]   Wonderful.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.540]   It isn't.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.540]   It's true.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.220]   Operation Mints meet how a dead man in a bizarre plan fooled the Nazis and assured
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:09.220]   allied victory.
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.260]   A lot of fiction to science fiction.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260]   Try it today.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:13.260]   Audible.com/Mac.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.580]   Break time for our picks of the week.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.580]   Let's start with you Andy and Otko.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.900]   Actually, can you come back to me?
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.900]   Except it grabs a little bit.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:28.140]   Let's come back to you Andy and Otko and start with you Renee Richie.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts abstains.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   Curiously.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.820]   I think he's going to filibuster.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:38.260]   I defer to the men, men from the Republic of Montreal, Canada.
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:46.020]   So I have, I've been a fan of Padd and Quill's iPad cases for a long time.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.100]   Several of my family members use it.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.740]   They all like that it's sort of like the moleskin old leather bound book look because
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:55.940]   you take something that's so high tech, so aluminum and glass and you put it in something
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:00.180]   that's fabric and wood and it has a very nice duality.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:07.380]   So they sent me one of their MacBook Air cases and this one is exactly what you would imagine.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:11.260]   It's exactly what you would imagine in the iPad case, but because the MacBook Airs are
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:16.780]   so small now, you can just encase them in a similar thing.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.740]   I've had that for my iPad for a long time, but I didn't know they made them for the
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.740]   air that's great.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.740]   Absolutely.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.740]   And this is for the 11 inch.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.740]   They do make the 13 inch one though.
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.380]   I find the 13 inch one starts to get a little bit big for a book.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.940]   It's more like one of those old Dungeons and Dragons tomes if you get that big.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.500]   But this is very nice.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.340]   Some people don't like putting a case on a computer because you don't read it like
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.300]   a book the way you do a tablet.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.980]   But I've seen a lot of people use them.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.220]   A friend of mine has this on her 11 inch MacBook Air.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.380]   It works wonderfully.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.260]   You can carry it under your arm like a book if you don't want to take a bag with you.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.540]   It'll protect it if you have it in a big bag.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:52.900]   It'll become a stand for it if you want to elevate the keyboard and angle it if you're
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.500]   typing in a coffee shop, read a desk, read a restaurant.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.900]   And it's just it's so beautifully.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.540]   They're all handcrafted in Minnesota.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.620]   They put a lot of care and energy into them.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.580]   They have a variety of colors now.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.900]   And it's just a really beautiful product.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.460]   So if you're looking for something that brings sort of old world charm to your latest and
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:17.300]   greatest technology, the Pat and Quill stuff is really impressive piece of kit.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.660]   Pad and Quill.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.660]   Is that PQ?
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.660]   Yes.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.620]   What is the website?
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.620]   Pad and Quill.com.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   Pad and Quill.com.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.820]   They even made a teeny tiny one for my pad.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:33.020]   And I was a joke and it took off.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.980]   There are a couple other companies that make these, but this looks nice.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   I'm very sure for laptops.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.980]   This is the only one that I've seen for laptops.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980]   Well, I know several.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.980]   I know Dodo is very famous for making.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:43.980]   Yeah, Dodo started this.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.340]   My app just came out in the app store a couple of days ago and it's kind of an interesting
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.460]   idea and I thought it would be kind of fun to try it with the Moto X.
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.140]   Gives your Mac and Tosh some Moto X features.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:59.460]   It's called Dialog 699 in the app store.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.260]   It runs in the menu bar, a little menu bar.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:09.700]   And you can actually make a phone call from your Bluetooth connected phone, which is kind
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.100]   of a cool idea.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.020]   Uses Bluetooth Connect with the phone.
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:18.260]   It allows you to make and answer phone calls over your Mac and Tosh.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.540]   The Mac becomes the Bluetooth headset in effect.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.380]   Although if you had a USB headset, you'd get better results.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.900]   So the audio quality is really going to depend on having a headset.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:34.180]   And remember, Bluetooth headset does not have the same super high fidelity that A2DP
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.180]   does.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.580]   So it'll sound like you're on a Bluetooth headset on the phone.
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.620]   Just you got to be aware of that.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:40.620]   But very cool.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:43.380]   Let me, it'll.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.380]   It wants my.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.860]   Now, I'm not sure we should show this because I don't want to show any phone numbers.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.340]   Let me just try this without showing it on screen first.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.500]   And because I think it's going to show the phone number if I do yet, is unfortunately.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.900]   So I can look up, it knows my, it has my address book and I can look up a name.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:02.460]   Who could I call that it wouldn't matter?
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.460]   Call Starbucks.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:04.940]   Ask for 300 lots of hits.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:09.740]   Well, I'll just, I'll make a phone call and you'll be able to see it happening here.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:13.660]   So it's going to make an outgoing call using this phone to call this phone.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.460]   How about that?
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.060]   And that's going through my Macintosh, which is, which is kind of cool.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.260]   So I'll just pick up the phone here.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.740]   Oops.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.500]   Hi, this is Leo.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.980]   Hi Leo.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:30.980]   How are you?
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.980]   How are you?
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.980]   Good.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980]   How are you?
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.580]   This is the worst demo ever.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:42.300]   But the idea is using Bluetooth, I used one phone to call the other phone.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.860]   You can record the phone call on the Mac, which is kind of cool.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.940]   Uses the Mac's audio.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.940]   I think worth $699, a really good idea.
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:53.660]   It's called dialogue and it's available now at the app store.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.060]   Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.300]   Phoneception.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.900]   Now Andy and I, your pick of the week.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.940]   Actually fitting in very nicely with Renee's picks.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.380]   These are two iPad mini cases that I've come across for the past few weeks that I've liked
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   a lot.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:13.500]   The problem with the iPad mini, the that magnetic cover that Apple sells does not work.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.180]   It will not stick on as desirable.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.180]   It's powerful.
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.180]   Exactly.
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:21.100]   And I've had problems finding one that's exactly what I want it to be.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:26.820]   So I found too that I like this is Hammerhead's copo, they call it the copo case.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:32.740]   And it is a completely enclosing hard shell, which I like because I like this is so small
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:36.260]   I should just toss it into whatever bag I have, not care what, where it lands or what
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.380]   happens to it.
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:41.340]   And this will give you completely every surface protection.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.340]   There are other cases like this, but what I like about this is that it has the double
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.460]   hinge so that when you're actually reading with it, it'll fold, it'll fold absolutely
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.460]   flat.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:54.220]   And also because there are some freaks out there and yes, I say the word freaks who actually
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.540]   will type on the iPad mini.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.860]   It will also like fold into a stand.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.820]   Thanks to this little catch right here.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:07.340]   So you can have it like standing up for movie viewing or typing or anything like that.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.380]   And like I said, the main idea is that I don't have to worry about this.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.620]   The screen scratching, I don't have to worry about anything else.
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:16.100]   I can just toss it into an outside pocket and not care about it.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.620]   For protection, they're the people who they don't necessarily, they wanted to still be
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:26.460]   an iPad mini, but they wanted to have some protection against being dropped.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:32.620]   And so Newer Tech has this brand new case, they call the KX, which is one of these like
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:36.460]   rubber glove like snap on, slap snap on cases.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:40.500]   So when you use it, basically, it doesn't really make it into anything other than what
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.260]   it is, which is a handy tablet with a screen on it.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:44.260]   You don't have to open it.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:46.540]   You don't have to do anything like that in order to access it.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:50.540]   But now they say that this is, you can throw this, excuse me, drop this down a flight of
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.540]   stairs.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.540]   It is military drop tested.
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.540]   I will read the numbers for you.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:30:02.460]   Certified mill at mill standard 810G US backed up, of course, by an authority, no less
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:05.460]   important than a YouTube video.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:12.700]   But I will say that I did tentatively drop this first on a carpeted floor and then on
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:17.060]   a tile floor and nothing happened or nothing, it bounced a little bit.
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:22.260]   It is like a very, very high density sort of a gel inside, very head and seat plastic.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.260]   It seems to hold on.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:26.780]   I don't have it on it right now, of course, but it seems to grip very, very closely so
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.220]   it doesn't feel like you've got like a, you know, a Christmas sweater or a Cosby sweater
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.020]   on your iPad.
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:37.380]   So I would, so again, if you're just looking for something that doesn't impede the usability
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:42.180]   of the iPad mini, but gives up some drop protection, this is really nice.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.100]   It's $69, I think.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.780]   Yeah, list of $69.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.700]   The hammerhead case is a lot less expensive.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.700]   It's $29.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:54.740]   I suspect it's not really drop resistant as the other thing, but it will give you some hard
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:31:00.020]   shell protection and basically keep that case from getting dinged up and banged up when you
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.700]   abuse it inside your case and stuff.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.860]   And that's only $29, I think, list price.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:09.860]   So two really cool choices, two different kinds of uses, I think.
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:12.380]   Thank you, Andy and I co thank you, Renee Richie.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.020]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:18.420]   Renee Richie is at imore.com where you can find the latest Apple news.
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:23.060]   He also works at some other sites for other phones and companies.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.860]   So don't mention stuff.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:25.860]   Stop.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.820]   And you still do and talk the talk vision stuff?
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.460]   We're talking about what's off this week.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:33.140]   It returns next week with cloud.
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:36.140]   And since we're on and off week, there's somebody else.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.540]   Can I tell you something else, Leo?
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:41.580]   We launched a new show called Vector, which is kind of one on one talk about really geeky
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.580]   subjects.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:45.700]   And yesterday I spent an hour talking to Brian Klug from Anand.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   I love Brian.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.900]   He is fantastic battery life and benchmark test.
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.780]   A lot of stuff has been really controversial lately.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:56.980]   I have to open Wikipedia when he talks about retina in terms of arc light minutes, but
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.540]   I always learn something from it.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:31:59.540]   Super smart guy.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.380]   That's vector.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.740]   The news show from imore.com/vector.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.300]   I'm more.com/vector.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.420]   Nick Arnott last week.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:09.460]   Guy English the week before John Syracuse.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.820]   Are you getting the big names?
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.820]   That's awesome.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.260]   We're trying to do super geeky stuff.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:14.500]   Super geeky.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.060]   They call him super geeky.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:22.140]   Andy Naco writes for the Chicago Sun times and someday soon his Nokia 1020 review will
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.180]   emerge in full flower.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.620]   I can't say Nokia.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.620]   I know.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.620]   I can't hear it.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.820]   I realize I was supposed to say Nokia.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:37.580]   I'd be thinking of potato dumplings served in a red sauce or a yukia or a Billy crystal
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:40.060]   imitating Samutavus Jr.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.780]   I'm not such nakas for you man.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.780]   America.
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:46.140]   Let me also also the American pronunciation.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.780]   I'm sorry the official pronunciation.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.100]   If America thinks it's Nokia, it's Nokia.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.340]   Let me play the ad.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.340]   Just change it.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.340]   Just this is the audio.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.140]   We didn't play the ad because I didn't want to, but this is the audio.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:33:03.180]   And if you listen, every day more photos are taken on the iPhone than any other phone.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:10.100]   But at Nokia, we prefer to build for quality, not just quantity.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.340]   I don't get it.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:14.340]   Nokia.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.340]   Say it as a Swedish chef.
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:16.340]   I don't know.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:20.780]   I got to get a fit in here.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:21.780]   Nokia phone.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.780]   Nokia.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.420]   Thank you Andy.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.420]   Thank you Renee.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.420]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:30.860]   We do Mac break weekly 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time 1900 UTC on Tuesday's first show
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.380]   of the week for me.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.380]   And it's always a lot of fun.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:35.460]   I'm so glad you watched.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:37.340]   If you can watch live, it's always good to do that.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.580]   But if you can't, we make on demand audio and video available after the fact of all of
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:44.220]   our shows at our website, twit.tv.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:47.820]   In this case, twit.tv/mabw.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:53.100]   But you can also get it from iTunes or wherever you subscribe to podcasts, since to cast, pocket
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:59.420]   cast, dog catcher, whatever the podcaster of choice is, Stitcher.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.580]   We're on them all.
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.580]   Kalika.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.380]   Thank you Renee.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.380]   Thank you Andy.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.380]   Thank you all for watching.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380]   Now get back to work.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.380]   Get tons of them.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:07.380]   [music]
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:18.300]   [music]
