[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.060]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover all the Apple news.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.580]   >> And far from weekly, in fact today, a very strong panel as we practice the final week.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.580]   This is always the toughest time of the Mac year, the week before the iPhone reveal.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.060]   Jason Snell has come up from his lair in Marin.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.700]   Good to have you.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.500]   >> It's great to be here.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.740]   >> It's the best week.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.580]   >> Executive editor, managing editor.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.500]   >> Editorial director.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.820]   >> Editorial director of IDG.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.580]   >> I like make up titles.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.060]   >> Mac World PC World.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.460]   >> Tech Hive.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.260]   >> And Greenbot.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.860]   >> And Greenbot.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.660]   >> But we don't talk about the Android site today because this is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.300]   >> I didn't realize Greenbot was yours because there was a very good story in Greenbot this
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100]   week and I wanted to make sure I covered it, but not here, obviously.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.620]   >> Right.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.700]   >> We want to explain it.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.020]   >> But I didn't realize it was yours.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.060]   So that means that makes it real credible and real and very good story.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.940]   But I won't talk about that today because goodness gracious, we've got an exciting week
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.940]   ahead.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.220]   Mr. Andy Inako is also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.220]   >> Greetings.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.860]   >> And Renee Arice from some Spanish Montreal.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.860]   >> Spanish Montreal, more.com.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.260]   Good to have you all here.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.020]   You're all going on Tuesday to the Flint Center in Cupertino.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.540]   >> We'll be there as we record this exactly a week from now.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.020]   We'll be sitting in those seats.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.300]   >> We are looking for a way to bring you live to our studios from there after the event.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.740]   And we will cover, I should say, we will cover the event.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.340]   I was not invited as per usual.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.380]   Although if Gizmo got in, I don't know what they have against me, but we will, Gizmodo
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.380]   got in.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.020]   Of all things since the first time since 2009.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.020]   >> I kind of want to see how are they dressed?
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.740]   They decide we're going to have to really savor this just in case there's just an
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.740]   evil trick.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.740]   >> Just in case there's like a big red lever on the stage.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.780]   >> When that'd be funny if Tim Cook said, you have a special chair.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780]   >> Oh, you, come here.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.420]   >> Don't bother looking at the seams that are underneath the floor.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.900]   Just you'll know what they're for.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.620]   >> This led credence to my belief that I'm in fact not being punished, but they just
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.620]   forgot about me.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.540]   Because if I were being punished, I think if Gizmodo's off the double super secret
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.100]   probation, then I must be.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.820]   >> Yeah, we had people invited who've never been invited before.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.900]   It's just because the venue's so large now.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.060]   >> They just forgot me.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.900]   How big is the Flint Center?
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   >> 3500?
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   >> I heard 2500.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   It's big.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300]   >> Is it bigger than Moscone West?
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.300]   No.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   >> I don't think so.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   >> About the same size, I would guess.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.780]   >> A little bit smaller if that number is accurate.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.140]   >> So it's not for size.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.860]   I have two theories about it.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.180]   We will talk about all of this.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.380]   Actually, what we're going to do is the first segment has to be iCloud and the fampening.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.780]   And to use the parts of the kids.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.940]   >> There's the explicit tag.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.380]   >> To use the language of the street.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.460]   >> That was the worst of the Highlander movies.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   >> We didn't, you know, it had.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.460]   >> Stay off that street.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.700]   >> That story broke yesterday or Sunday during Twit.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.620]   And I declined to do it because I just felt like this is not something I want to publicize.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.100]   But by now I think everybody knows about it and has gone in search of the pictures.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.260]   And really the story in this, for us, is the technology story of iCloud security.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.460]   Now we should say right up front that no one really knows how these pictures of, these
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.940]   naked pictures of celebrities were garnered.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940]   >> Right.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:25.100]   >> Jonathan Zadarski, who is the guy who did the very interesting speech at 2600 at Hope
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.180]   for about the security of the iPhone and the flaws in the security iPhone, has been looking
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.180]   into this.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.460]   And you know Jonathan, I think you trust Jonathan.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.660]   >> Yeah, sharp guy.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.780]   I think he's a very sharp guy.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.380]   No one is quite sure if, now apparently the hackers who published these photos on 4chan.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:52.980]   And there was, again we don't know the providence of it, but a post from him in a hacker forum
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.660]   which was republished saying thanks to all the people who helped me do this.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.660]   >> Right.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.660]   >> And we're not sure.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.740]   >> What I thought many have had is that there is a known or was, it's been fixed backdoor
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.620]   and find my iPhone that allowed a brute force remote attack.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.020]   >> Right, they weren't rate limiting password fails.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.820]   So you could sit there and just keep on trying more and more passwords and theoretically
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.260]   guess the password after millions of attempts.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.260]   >> If you were a --
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.260]   >> If you had a female address and they didn't use two factor, you could just --
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.140]   >> If you knew the female address, there weren't any other factor.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.860]   And you were a natural target, which of course I think these actors are.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.860]   >> Sure.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.660]   >> Then you might in your -- and this might, that post on the BBS might kind of increment
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.980]   them on that regard because it would take more than one person.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.980]   It would take a fairly concerted effort to --
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.100]   >> What's possible also is that you have a group of people who just do this kind of
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.260]   thing and they had a list of iCloud addresses and they were waiting for an exploit.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.820]   And then when this exploit was published, as it was a couple days earlier, they picked
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.900]   the best targets that they had available and went after them as quickly as they could.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.020]   Because even with no rate limit, it still takes a while to do dictionary attacks against
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.700]   email addresses and you can't get a lot done -- I mean depending on how simple their password
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.860]   is, but it's quite possible again that these people have been getting photographs for a
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.340]   long time through a variety of methods and they were well prepared to act on this flaw
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.340]   when it was discovered.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.860]   >> I'm saying some speculation that this might have been a cache of data that somebody
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.860]   had kept.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.860]   >> Over a period of time.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.860]   >> And then that leaked.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.860]   >> Right.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:27.020]   >> That this is one person who had a bat who didn't protect his stash of naughtiness and
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.620]   then someone grabbed it and just -- the fact that there's so many that are reported as
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.020]   genuine and but some that are reported as fake indicates there's a sort of a spread
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.060]   provenance of sources here.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.580]   >> Shadarski earlier today said that got a full file name dumped from at least one celebrity's
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.580]   leak.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.820]   It is consistent with the theft of an iPhone backup, presumably from iCloud.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.220]   Shadarski, this is the most important thing.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.700]   We're going to say this right up front.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.300]   Shadarski says, and I think we all agree, if you haven't done so, change your iCloud
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.980]   password particularly if you're a celebrity.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.140]   Turn on second factor authentication.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.780]   And this is a really important step.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.860]   A lot of people -- I don't keep anything on photo stream.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:13.020]   But delete any old iCloud backups because he believes it's now that it's not iCloud,
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.020]   the photo stream, it's iCloud backups that were --
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.020]   >> Right.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.580]   So you think the photo that you're embarrassed by or couldn't leak out, if you delete it
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.740]   from your photo stream, it's not necessarily gone.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.420]   It may be in your iCloud backup, the safest thing to do.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.300]   >> You should point out that you can turn off camera roll backup when you go through
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.300]   the iCloud list.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.100]   And it's one of the best things to do because it takes up so much of your iCloud space
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.100]   anyway.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   So if you don't need it, absolutely turn that off.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.380]   >> And also make sure you go through your social media stuff, Flickr, when you install
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.380]   the Flickr app, it asks do you want me to backup your stuff automatically?
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.060]   Dropbox of the same thing, Facebook photos, same thing.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.740]   Go through everything that deals with photos.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.900]   Really, when it comes to personal photos, I'm not talking about naughtiness, we're just
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.460]   talking about family photos, I don't want the world to see.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.980]   The only time that gets backed up is over copper inside on my desktop.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.940]   And that's how much level of trust is for this stuff.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:10.100]   >> Yeah, I mean, I do store pictures on Google and on Facebook and on iCloud.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.820]   I turned off photo stream a long time ago, but mostly because I didn't seem to be able
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.020]   to control those pictures, I kept getting my son's pictures mixed in with mine because
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.620]   we shared accounts.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.700]   So I'm looking at my iPad right here.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700]   Would you walk me through?
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.540]   Because this is the most important thing.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.980]   By the way, is photo stream uploads turned on?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.980]   >> I think so.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   >> It is the default.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.740]   So somebody was saying, why would anybody upload these newties?
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.540]   Well, A, if it's a backup, then that's not even been uploaded, that's just being backed
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.180]   up and B, it's default.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.180]   Right?
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.180]   >> Yeah, I think so.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.700]   >> So can you help me, Jason?
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.020]   Let's get rid of this right now.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.420]   So we're going to go to iCloud.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.500]   This is on an iPad, but it'll be very similar.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.820]   And should I do storage and backup?
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.300]   >> Well, one thing you can do is go to photos.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   >> And disable this.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.620]   >> And turn off my photo stream.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.300]   >> Turning off photo stream of delete all photos from your iPad that have been downloaded.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.300]   >> Right.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.300]   >> But delete the photos on the photo stream on iCloud.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.820]   >> That's a good question.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.140]   >> It depends on if you have other devices using it.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.740]   >> Yeah, so that's something important.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.900]   You're going to go to all your iOS devices and iPhoto on the Macintosh and disable that.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   >> Right.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.740]   >> Now, what am I going to do about the backups?
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.700]   I've been storing backups.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.700]   I have iCloud backup.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.460]   >> Put a manage storage.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.460]   >> Manage storage.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.460]   >> And it takes a while.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.500]   >> This is going to take a long time.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.260]   And I will be able to delete the backups, the old backups.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.100]   >> Yeah, I think you can delete the photo backups.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.260]   You can turn off backing up the camera roll.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   You can also delete.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.460]   Because one of the things that Darski found when he looked at Kate Upton's, they had all
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.500]   the ex-if information for Kate Upton.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.580]   And it turned out that he believes, at least it was her boyfriend's data that was compromised.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.380]   But there were multiple iPhones registered.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.580]   So it could have been, she had an old iPhone 3GS backup and she was currently using a new
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.540]   iPhone and maybe forgot about it.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.740]   But there was also multiple dates and times and maybe multiple devices involved.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.820]   So it's an important thing for people to know how to do and to keep track of.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.420]   >> That's kind of the dark flip side of how easy some companies make it to administer,
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.740]   demonstrate and backup your hardware.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.220]   You forget how to do it yourself and therefore you're not aware of the risks of basically
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.540]   daily life with this device.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.540]   >> I don't know.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.620]   I mean, syncing your photos is really convenient.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:35.820]   I think it would be a shame if the lesson we took from this is, well, turn off all photos
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.820]   syncing.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.820]   >> Oh, it's really useful.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.300]   >> I think you do need to be aware and a lot of, especially, I mean, I've got a 12-year-old
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:48.020]   almost 13-year-old daughter being aware that when you take a photo with your iPhone, unless
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.580]   you make some choices, it's going to sync it to the cloud.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.020]   And at that point, you're asking everybody to perform pretty serious security practices,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.300]   have a hard to guess password, a good password, have two factor authentication turned on.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.620]   These are not things that regular people, busy people, people, I would imagine like these
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.500]   stars in fact, are going to be really comfortable with their--
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   >> They are now.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.180]   >> They're probably in Hollywood, it's going to be a very big business in people who help
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.580]   stars secure their stuff.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.020]   >> It's going to be like a bodyguard, right?
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.020]   >> They'll have a cyber bodyguard.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.620]   >> That's the difficulty I'm talking about.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.380]   If you don't understand how your car works, you might decide that, oh, well, it's no big
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.380]   deal.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.420]   I ran out of gas in the middle of the road.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.940]   Well, at least now I know exactly what the empty level is.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.220]   If you know how cars work, you know that, okay, you probably just fried out the fuel
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.420]   injectors in your engine and also your fuel pump, which gets cooled from the gas in the
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.860]   tank, also probably got fried.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.100]   That might be a $1,000 repair, like four months down the road when these things start going
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   away.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.460]   I think that maybe we are doing--we and Apple, everybody else are doing people a disservice
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.100]   when we expect, don't learn how these things work.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.340]   It just works automatically.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.940]   You don't even have to think about settings or anything like that.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.340]   There needs to be a certain basic level of admin literacy for every device that you own.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.980]   I don't think we should discourage people from learning how to do that stuff.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.020]   I think that this is a situation like this is not an opportunity to scare people into
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.100]   thinking never back anything up by a drop box.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.180]   But it's an opportunity to say, "Here is how things work.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.100]   You've got to know how things work on a starship lieutenant."
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.180]   And basically so that they have that information so that they're not caught by surprise.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.180]   I kind of disagree.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.820]   I feel like the promise of computing is so great.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.460]   It's a shame that you have to become a security expert to use it.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.380]   Well, the idea should be that default literacy, not an expert, but literacy.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.820]   The defaults need to be very specific.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.540]   I mean, Apple doesn't like to talk about security.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.300]   It doesn't want its users to think about security.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.820]   But I think this is a good example of how Apple needs to crank up what it considers the
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.620]   default level of security on its devices.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.460]   Something like this.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.900]   That's who's going to take the blame, whether or not they deserve it.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.300]   Well, the Ray Limit bug is their fault.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.740]   If that is how this got out, that's their fault.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.180]   But I see people in the chat room talking about, "Well, I'm never going to use this
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.820]   service again."
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.140]   Every photo-syncing service has this exact same issue.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.940]   Your photos are on a server somewhere.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.340]   And if somebody knows the password, they can see them.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.780]   So I feel like this is -- all of these companies are really reluctant to move to something like
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.740]   two-factor authentication because it's a huge support issue.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.420]   It's a huge communication issue.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.740]   But at the same time, it's way more secure than what we have now.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.620]   And so at some point, I think they're going to have to just bite the bullet because this
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.620]   is too painful.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.340]   There's another problem to consider, and that is -- I mean, it's a huge interface challenge.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.940]   Security is incredibly hard to present that in an understandable way to people.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.020]   But things like iCloud exists because people weren't backing up.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   And when people didn't back up, they lost things.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.380]   And that was also a huge problem.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.660]   So you have to juggle these two contentious issues, which is keeping people's data safe
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.500]   and also making sure that data isn't used against them.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.580]   For example, I use photo-stream.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.740]   I back up my camera roll.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.220]   It's 98% iOS 8 screenshots right now.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.340]   But I have no problem backing anything up to any service.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.620]   I consider it fine.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.060]   Some people will have a problem, and they should have tools.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.140]   And I liked -- Dave Whiskis is a designer behind Vesper, and he had the idea that just
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.820]   like you have private browsing mode on Safari, you should have private camera mode on the
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   camera app.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.180]   And there's a very easy to see switch.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.180]   You hit it.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.180]   It's in private mode.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.180]   There you go.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.180]   Photos are never backed up.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.180]   There you go.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.180]   They're temporary.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.300]   They delete themselves after a short period of time, and then you can use it safely, visibly,
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.100]   understandably, and not have to worry about the complexities of backup.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.540]   I should point out, Google+ does not apply by default, nor does Facebook apply by default.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.540]   This is an Apple.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   They ask you when you say.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.540]   They give you the opportunity, but this is an Apple default that perhaps shouldn't be
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.540]   a default.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:36.460]   And I'm always recommending that people turn these on, and I use Facebook, Google, and
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.660]   Apple, and Dropbox, and OneDrive.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.260]   I let them all take copies of my pictures.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.340]   But I guess the really bottom line is you should be careful anything on the internet
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.540]   could at any point become public.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.900]   So when you put something on the internet, you should consider whether you're willing
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.460]   to have that become public.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.860]   And I agree that Apple and others should make it easier to do -- I mean, look, people
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.180]   are going to take compromising pictures with their smartphone.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.180]   That's what it's for.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.540]   Well, I mean, there's an issue that -- and I don't want to stop people from doing that.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.020]   Well, maybe there's a new market in secure photo apps that don't save to a camera roll
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.980]   and, you know, you know, that already.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.700]   Yeah, camera plus does that, right?
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.740]   You camera plus will save it to its own unique storage that is not -- well, it's backed up
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.740]   by it.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.740]   But if it's encrypted -- anything's backed up by Apple backup, right?
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.820]   Yeah, but if it's encrypted before it's backed up, then you would need your secret
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.820]   password.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.820]   That's important.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.820]   Also, these aren't new issues.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.380]   Like, a long time ago, paparazzi hit on beaches and took photos and sold them to tabloids and
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.980]   they pushed them on every cashier line.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.420]   And I used to do self-defense and personal protection.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.980]   And you have to explain to people why it is your absolute right to where anything you
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.820]   want and go anywhere you want.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.380]   But this is a savage world and you have to take precautions against those.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.380]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.100]   What did you used to do?
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.540]   Personal protection and self-defense.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.540]   What?
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.540]   You were like a bodyguard?
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.140]   No, I taught people.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.220]   Anyway, it was a much before I got into gadgets.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220]   I need to know more about this.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220]   Hold on a second.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.220]   He's a published author of many books on the side.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.140]   Are you packing right now?
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.140]   What do you do?
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.140]   Carate?
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.140]   What do you do?
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.140]   None?
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.860]   No, I write -- most recently I did Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.740]   But you know, that's just -- I do a lot of different things.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.940]   But the idea was that most of it has nothing to do with -- sorry?
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.140]   Nobody told me!
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.980]   No, you see, the thing is like martial arts, any expert will tell you that has like 10
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.180]   percent to do with self-defense.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.500]   Self-defense is almost entirely behavior prevention, role-playing, modeling, you know, understanding
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.540]   how the world is and making sure that you minimize your target.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.500]   And cybersecurity is the same thing.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.060]   What is the threat assessment for this and how do I make sure that I am not -- if I am
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.780]   a visible target, how do I protect myself and how do I make sure I'm not a visible target?
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.740]   It's a wake-up call for everybody for sure.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.980]   But we've always said that.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.900]   It's your behavior that really not having any -- people say, "Oh, I got an antivirus.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.900]   I'm safe.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900]   I got a bodyguard.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   I know Jiu Jitsu.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.900]   I'm safe."
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900]   No, it's --
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.900]   It's a crime.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   Like these people had a crime to it.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.660]   A lot of people say, "Oh, it's a celebrity nude pic.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.660]   It's not a big deal."
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.660]   No, this --
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.660]   This is a horrible crime.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.820]   The car data can be stolen, personal data.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.300]   This was data that was stolen from these people and distributed without their permission.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   This is an absolute crime.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.500]   It doesn't matter what the content is.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.900]   No, and we don't -- I think it's -- in any way contest that or condone it, that's not
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900]   at all what we're talking about.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.900]   This is a hack, yeah.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.660]   No, I think it's even more intense than that, given the nature of the quote data and quote
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.780]   that was being disseminated.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.460]   That's a violation of someone's person.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.620]   That's terrible.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.940]   I think the good news is I think a lot of -- almost everybody agrees.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.740]   And there has been a general rejection of those photos of passing them around.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.460]   I think that's the good news is this was so egregious.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.100]   It wasn't just one or two pictures.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.100]   It was so egregious.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.540]   There was so much of it.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.100]   I think even 4chan has 4chan taken it down or not.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.580]   You can't really expect much from 4chan.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.140]   No, no, Reddit has definitely been.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.700]   Reddit immediately did.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.620]   The image which was holding a lot of these images, those sites are being shut down as
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.620]   they are discovered.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.620]   So --
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.140]   But it's people who rally about the importance of privacy and security are also taken delight
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.740]   in the violation of the privacy and security of others, which should not be a point you
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740]   shouldn't be lost on.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   No, no.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   Actually, besides Jonathan Jadarski, Swift on security has been my go-to.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   Yes.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.860]   It's actually a really good Twitter account by somebody pretending to be Taylor Swift.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:20.780]   I think it's a woman in security because her advice is really good.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.180]   She wrote a really excellent piece on her tumbler.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:30.980]   I'm going to see if I can find that on what I would do as Taylor Swift, what I would do
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.300]   if my phone had been compromised like this.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:42.060]   If you just read it, the first thing that she says is, "Okay, everybody should have a
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.580]   Faraday bag ready at all times to stick your phone in."
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.780]   And because you don't hear it as waxing poetic, Swift on security.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.780]   But I have this --
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.780]   How do you count how to do this?
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.780]   That's a remarkable experience.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.020]   But it's actually great if my phone got hacked.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.060]   And what she recommends is fairly interesting.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.060]   Now, some of it requires you being a very rich, famous celebrity because what she wants
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.340]   to do is put it in a Faraday bag, but add -- because the phone has then increased their
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.420]   power at 100% to communicate with radio towers.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.100]   You don't want the phone to go off because there's important forensic information there.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.420]   So you have a battery in the Faraday bag with it.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.260]   Plus, you have a window in your Faraday bag that will help you as you're flying to Apple
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:33.140]   or Microsoft in Redmond, as you're on your way in your private jet, you want to be able
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.220]   to go through all your accounts and make -- see what was compromised and change those passwords
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   immediately.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.900]   She says, "Luckily, I don't use Android," which I wouldn't trust to take a time-lapse
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.500]   video of a flower I wasn't ever planning on watching.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.620]   It's good to point out, too, that this is not just a cloud storage.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.420]   I mean, people have had their phones -- literally their phones, a physical phone.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.420]   That's right.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.620]   People have had -- with positions of trust, people who worked at hotels, technicians who
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.540]   set up their devices, people who ran their social media for them, what access to their
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.220]   accounts, there are multiple vectors to getting to people.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.220]   What?
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.220]   It's not as simple as --
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.660]   What we're really telling is this is -- it looks like, according to Shudarski, this is
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.900]   the iCloud backup of their device.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:18.940]   I mean, at the core, what this is about is where complicated technology collides with
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.460]   this expectation of ease of use in these devices that everybody is using now.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   That's right.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.140]   And all the -- I mean, when we talk about Apple making things on by default and doing
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.620]   the backups, they're trying to make life easier.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.740]   The more complicated you make it, in some cases, the more secure you make it.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.820]   But they don't want -- I mean, this is the battle, is they don't want to make it too
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.820]   complicated.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.700]   They don't want people to feel like they're back in the day of installing antivirus software
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.340]   on their PC.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.300]   But this can be the result of that.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.740]   And it's fascinating to watch.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.980]   And I don't know what the solution is.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.940]   Matt Hohnen wrote a great article on Wired about the death of the password a while back
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.060]   and how security is really not very secure on the Internet.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.540]   And we want to use it because it's so darn convenient.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.900]   And computer companies want to make it easy to use.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.860]   But the easier you make it, and sometimes the less secure it is.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.740]   And that's what we're running up against.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.420]   You know, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't want to have a 15-character password that she
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.580]   has to input every time she restarts her phone.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.580]   But if she doesn't --
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.820]   That puts the burden on Apple, though.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.820]   Well, it's --
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.820]   Here's Apple.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.100]   By the way, Apple posted this on September 2nd at 2.30 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   Nine minutes ago?
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.020]   We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.100]   When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple's engineers
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.180]   to discover the source.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.340]   Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.060]   After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.500]   accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords, and security
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500]   questions.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.820]   A practice that has become all too common on the Internet.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:03.180]   One of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple's
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.900]   systems, including iCloud or Find My iPhone.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   We are --
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.460]   Now, breach is different from the brute force of it.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.460]   Right.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   So it's possible that the brute force --
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.460]   And they did --
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.460]   The brute force offered to you.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.460]   -- fixed for the brute force.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   So that seems to me that they -- Of course, that fixed was proactive before they knew what
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.780]   it was.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.660]   They said, "Well, let's fix this anyway."
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.340]   We're continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved, to
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.100]   protect against this type of attack we advise all users to always use a strong password
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.660]   and enable two-step verification.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.940]   So if people don't know what two-step is, the idea here is that whenever I want to edit
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:43.420]   anything involving my Apple ID, I get a text message that's sent to either my phone or
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.740]   my wife's phone.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.300]   And it's got a code.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.340]   And if I don't enter in that code, nothing can happen.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.980]   So even if you knew my password and my Apple ID, you would also need to have one of those
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.580]   phones in your hand all at once in order to do it.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.820]   And yes, that could happen, but it's a much less likely scenario because at that point
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.140]   you have to basically rob somebody and make them put in their passwords and things like
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.140]   that.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.140]   And if they don't have my phone --
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.940]   -- Have the password on your phone as well, right?
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.060]   Exactly, absolutely.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.540]   So there are two-factor is a little complex to start and it's kind of a pain because now
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.780]   every time I want to log into Apple site or Google or anywhere else, I've got all these
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.620]   two-factor codes I have to enter.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.420]   But it means that somebody who guesses my password, even if they guess my password, which is a
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:33.100]   hard password to guess, they can't get in because they don't know the code because they
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.100]   don't have my phone.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.580]   By the way, this explains why Snapchat is so popular because there's the perception, not
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.580]   the reality.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.580]   The perception that it disappears.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.340]   The message does in iOS 8 as well.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.140]   Mark Cuban has released something called what Cyber Dust that does the same thing.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.380]   I think that there's going to be a market for this kind of thing among celebrities.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:57.700]   There's some people in the chat room who are worrying that I'm apologizing for Apple.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.940]   I just want to be clear.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.300]   A hack of find my iPhone would be bad for Apple but would be the best possible outcome
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.420]   for me because that would be closed down and then I don't have to worry about it.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.420]   It is closed down, right?
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.180]   What I'm trying to warn people about and what Leo mentioned in that statement is that
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.660]   this is not so simple as a hack.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.180]   A hack is very bad for them.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.180]   Good for us.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.180]   They can close it.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.220]   People who are continually finding ways to try and go for your password, go for email
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.500]   address, go for your security questions.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.700]   Security questions are a horrible idea.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.300]   I don't like that companies use them.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.420]   I fill them with pseudo random blobs and record them in one password.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420]   I agree.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.420]   I agree.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.420]   I agree.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   And the fact that Apple mentions the security questions I think is telling.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.220]   Remember, Paris Hilton got hacked.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.220]   Her iPhone got hacked.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.180]   In fact, there have been a number of iPhone hacks due to these security questions.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.180]   These are not.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.220]   In fact, I don't think security questions should be allowed.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220]   I agree.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.620]   I mean, it's the other company because people forget passwords.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.620]   They're gessable passwords.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.620]   It's the worst.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.620]   Gessable passwords.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.420]   Well, we're on that subject.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.700]   There's also such a problem of gessable email accounts that are attached to your phone.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.500]   So that's why it's probably good practice from, from this point forward to you have a separate
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.420]   account that's just used for sinking.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.500]   And it's not your name, first name, last name.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   It's not anything attached to you.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.260]   It is like a one passwords blob of a blob of asking.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.260]   That's a good idea.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.580]   Make a Gmail account that isn't your name.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.620]   And that's Man Honan found that out in his wired store because he got hacked and he got
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.660]   his phones remote wiped and lost his actually pictures of his children.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.660]   And it was horrifying.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.700]   But one of the reasons was a lot of sites were doing password resets where they showed
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.060]   the email address it was going to and then they would hack that email address.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.260]   That has changed where now you'll get like one character and then like the last character
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.980]   dot com.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.620]   But still Andy is exactly right.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.100]   Set up a Gmail account that's your safe haven that nobody knows and that's just some random
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.020]   unguessable Gmail account and have things go there.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   So let me just recap.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   Real quickly.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.660]   Don't use your real name as your login as your Apple ID as your retrieval address at
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.660]   least.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.980]   In fact, you should probably create a Gmail account that is a random string or something
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   only you would know.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.980]   No, you would know.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.100]   Not your dog's name, not your street address, not your zip code, but something only you
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.980]   would know when you use security questions and they do.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.340]   And many sites do still require you to set up security questions, which is a massive
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.460]   flaw.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.060]   Don't answer the question with a real answer.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.500]   Who is your favorite singer abandoned high school?
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.700]   Don't answer the Beatles.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.380]   Answer something that's what you use a random blob Renee that you generate with something
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.780]   like last password.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.940]   And you save it in last pass because obviously you're never going to recover that.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940]   That's going to really help you.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.940]   And then finally turn on two step verification.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.740]   I think if you do all of the above, then it would have to be a flaw in Apple's systems.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.740]   Right.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.580]   And that we've seen hacks come from the inside where there's compromised internal security.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.900]   But in this case, it seems like that's not what happened, that this is about bad external
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.540]   security individual people with gasable security questions or gasable passwords.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.460]   A little blame goes to Apple for allowing these kind of less secure solutions.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   Yes.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.460]   Yes.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.900]   And although that's true, I think for everybody, I mean, this is these guys are all watching
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.260]   each other to Google and Apple and Microsoft and Facebook.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.820]   I mean, they're all an Amazon.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:14.580]   They're all looking at each other about these things because in fact, Matt Honan's hack was
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.060]   across multiple websites.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.060]   And it was a social engineering hack.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.540]   It was not even a technology.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.060]   But it was one of those cases where Apple had a better security practice than Amazon.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.500]   So they went through Amazon.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   Right.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.700]   And but then use the information garnered from Amazon to reset the Apple account.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   So Apple had a vulnerability as well.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.980]   And I think Jadarski and others have banged on Apple enough to make sure that Apple's
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.300]   security policies and Steve Gibson will talk about this, I'm sure later on security now
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.700]   and he has in the past are very strong.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.740]   I'm probably the strongest of all of the smartphones out there.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   I agree.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.740]   But you're going to have to do some stuff too.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.060]   And I and I agree, there are some things Apple can do.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:01.580]   For instance, having a private photo button that says this isn't going to get uploaded
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.180]   anywhere is a great idea.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.220]   And furthermore, it'll be encrypted or something is a great idea because I don't think what
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.140]   you can't I think what you can't do and shouldn't do is say, well, user, you've got to stop taking
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.860]   pictures, you've got to stop putting pictures on the internet.
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.020]   Users are going to do that.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.500]   And so there's nothing wrong with that either.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.900]   I mean, and it's your right.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.820]   There's a lot of blame going on.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:28.220]   You know, if you buy a car and someone steals it, even if the locks aren't great on the car,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.700]   someone still stole it.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.820]   If you were never born, you would never feel pain and you would never die.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.820]   So you cannot go backwards.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.980]   If you never took a photo, it never be stolen.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.980]   That's ridiculous.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   Right.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.420]   Also the upside of these backups far outweigh anything else.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:46.260]   I mean, if you if my iPhone got remote wiped, I would be very pleased that Dropbox still
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.620]   has copies of my photos.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.940]   So there's always going to be a need to do this.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.020]   Not that we're turning this to a philosophy of life, but pain is part of life.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.540]   And so you as a second Star Trek movie reference, I need my pain.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.540]   My pain is useful to me.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.180]   My pain is valuable.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.700]   And so the risk of having things backed up offsite is usually not as big as the actual
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.700]   danger of losing that video of your baby's first steps and that sort of thing.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.980]   And the thing is, if you're a celebrity again, just like, you know, I have a house, I have
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.060]   to put a lock on that door.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.180]   If I was a celebrity, I'd have to take even more security procedures.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.100]   And it's not fair and it's horrible, but it's the realities of the world that we live
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   in.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.660]   And eventually it's going to be digital is the same as the real world.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.940]   You'll have to take even more security precautions just because there are more people targeting
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.940]   you.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.620]   And reiterate, Jonathan Jadarski has been doing a lot of very good work on and in public on
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.140]   his Twitter.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.900]   He says he has spoken to the FBI about the things he's posted on Twitter as well as
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.140]   more information that he has that he has not posted publicly.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.940]   Just got off the phone with an investigator at FBI conveyed my findings.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.700]   He believes and I think that there's strong evidence that he's correct that this was
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.900]   not a hack into iCloud exactly.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:58.060]   It was or into photo stream, but it was in fact somebody was able to get the backups from
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.500]   these people's phone.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.660]   And by the way, his most recent post is according to Apple, photo stream doesn't contain videos.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.860]   There were videos in this file them.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.260]   So videos must come from backup.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.740]   What some people have said is that once you get the password and the username, you can
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.700]   get the encryption keys and you can go straight to AWS or to Asia where the actual backups
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   are stored and pull them off.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.500]   I don't know if that's true or not, but that's one of the theories.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.780]   And incidentally, this person will be caught.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:29.180]   I'm given the information that Zadarski has already posted about who this person is.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.260]   This person will be caught.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.900]   I don't think this person is going to get away from person or persons.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.660]   It seems likely persons are going to get away with it.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.900]   And doesn't this seem like a really positive change in the climate?
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.660]   I can think of this time last year, the year before.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.620]   It seems as though there is a leak, excuse me, there is an unintentional undesired release
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.900]   of photos because of a boyfriend or someone who got even getting asked to people's phone.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.420]   And that's more like a blip in the celebrity news.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.100]   And this year we're saying, no, that's completely unacceptable.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.700]   And we are not not only is it wrong for that person to have done that, it was also morally
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.060]   wrong to even want to look at even an edited version of that photo on a popular entertainment
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.060]   site.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.500]   And so that's why all these sites that are usually who had been running around thinking
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.260]   that we are we are the celebrity Mavericks.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.220]   We are going to report on anything even even Perez Hilton like took down all the pictures
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.260]   he had posted right on and put in big, big apology saying that was an absolutely wrong
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   thing to do.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.300]   I did it fast because that's how we post things.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.340]   But and over and over again, I was wrong.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.860]   We should not have done that and I apologize for having done that.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.340]   So if this if the other things that come out of this is a certain increase in genteel behavior
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.980]   or even ethical behavior, that's a that's a really big positive.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:50.820]   And we'll put this in the show notes, but should ask you is on Twitter at JZD Z I R S K
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.220]   I and certainly worth following as well as swift on security should ask you retweeted
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:02.220]   Swift's post from yesterday computer securities dirty little secret is how much of the quote
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.700]   hacking people hear about is just brain dead color by numbers stuff.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.820]   And that's the other side of this.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.700]   This is not a brilliant hack by any means.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:16.620]   It really is reflects more persistence and and having a target and going to have a target
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.620]   and an evil mind and that's the most dangerous thing of all.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:24.980]   We rarely fee we rarely see these security breaches where everybody's data is at stake,
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.920]   but we rarely see a situation where somebody really, really, really wants your data specifically
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.340]   that that person got thrown away at the door.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.340]   It really depends like any good magic trick.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.140]   It depends on how hard you're willing to work to get the result you want.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.740]   And a lot of people are willing to work a hundred times harder than you imagine that
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.300]   they would be willing to work at it.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.700]   Anyway, thank you Jonathan.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.700]   I should ask you thank you Taylor Swift on security.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.460]   It was a good point.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.340]   Steve Gibson raised on Twitter and he was responding to some people who were asking us
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.340]   a question.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.140]   He was talking about just there are a lot of attacks out there.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.180]   And I know some people have made a big deal about the timing of this rub like immediately
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.500]   after the story broke news organizations put iCloud hack and headlines at a speed with
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.660]   which I could not believe they'd done any thinking about it whatsoever.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.260]   I mean it could be an iCloud hack, maybe it wouldn't be, maybe they'd ultimately proven
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.020]   right, but they didn't think before they did it.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.340]   They just put it in the headline because that is how you get clicks.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.340]   And Apple has a big reveal coming up and we're going to talk about it later, but part of
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.380]   that involves mobile payments.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.340]   And people are going to conflate these issues.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.420]   People are going to like my mother already contacted me about this and she's like the
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.420]   last person in the chain of how this information spreads.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.860]   Asking questions about what's going to happen with payments and it doesn't matter that
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.060]   the target or other retailers have been involved in massive breaches last year, doesn't matter
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.860]   whether this was a specific hack on a specific user count and not an iCloud hack in general.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.420]   People are going to see those headlines, those headlines that were really great to get clicks
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.780]   for about 24 hours on websites and it is going to scare them and make them reticent
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.900]   for technology that could help them the same way iCloud backups help people most of the
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.020]   time or the way that Touch ID helps people most of the time.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.500]   I think that's another victim in this.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.100]   Apple, Apple doesn't matter if it was Apple or Microsoft or anybody, but that we are so
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.820]   quick to give people that sort of fear of technology.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.540]   I think we should stop and think about sometimes.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.420]   And I love recode.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.820]   Actually, I don't.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:21.540]   That means sarcastic whose tweet is Apple says it was hacked in targeted account.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.700]   Apple said specifically it was not.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   Right.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.860]   It's users were hacked.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.580]   But that's the big point and unfortunately this is hugely damaging for Apple.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.620]   I think the takeaway on this, the timing couldn't be worse and the takeaway is going to be that
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.380]   normal people like your mom are going to have it burn to their brain.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.980]   Oh, you can't trust this thing.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.940]   You can trust the Visa card with the NFC chip that you might drop and let people like
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.500]   you over and over again.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.060]   But I, oh, it's got Apple and I heard these things about Apple last week or last month.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.340]   We're still in the process of updating what we believe Apple would do and would not do
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.460]   in any situation because it is a completely different Apple now I think over the past
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.460]   couple of years.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.700]   And so it's going to be interesting to see next week if they mention this obliquely,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.220]   if they totally rewrite whatever section of the script was going to be talked about iCloud
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:16.180]   and security or whether they simply do what Tim Cook did about maps only with this case,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.780]   something they're not 100% responsible for.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.580]   And somebody saying here's exactly what happened.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.900]   Here's how we're working with them and here's why your data is going to be safe.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.620]   And by the way, we're going to take, we're going to take a look behind the curtain to
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.180]   show you exactly how hard we work to make sure that your data, your data that you entrust
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.900]   to us, we will not compromise to anybody else.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.700]   I think Steve Jobs would not have mentioned this.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   I think Tim Cook will.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.380]   I think he needs to directly surprise me.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.380]   If since some of these features that we see in iOS, eight or things like the auto-expiring
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:49.020]   photos, I think they're going to have to at least give a nod to, you know, isn't this
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.020]   nice?
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.020]   The photos expire.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.860]   I want to step up to the front of the stage and say, I want to talk about this.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.620]   I want to apologize and we are doing everything we can.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.820]   He needs to apologize.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.820]   I agree.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.700]   You and I, we all know he doesn't.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:07.500]   But I think he needs to, to the regular people say, I think you extol the virtues of like,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.620]   they seem to be saying use two factor, right?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.020]   So maybe, maybe one of the things that they'll be able to say is something like, you know,
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.180]   we're recommending for all users of iOS eight, they turn on this thing and we're going to
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.140]   make it easier for you to do this.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.140]   That's what he needs to do.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.140]   And explain what two factor is.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.940]   What we're going to do because two factor would help a lot.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.340]   Here's how we're going to take care of this.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   He can't say, Hey, it's their fault.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.380]   We gave him lots of tools to prevent this.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:33.380]   No, he has to fall on his sword, even though everybody knows everybody in the inside knows
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.980]   it's not their fault and say, look, we're sorry that that was even possible.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.940]   And here's what we're going to do for going forward to make sure it never happens again.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.940]   I think he has to do that.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   I think when the signature differences.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.700]   I think when the signature differences of the new Apple, at least the kind that gets that
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.260]   they choose to present through their media events is a heightened sense of empathy to
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.140]   people who are not outside of Apple.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.020]   So this is why they, I think that when they're whiteboarding, how they're going to respond
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.300]   to this part of it is how does an outsider look at this problem, whether they're correct
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.620]   or incorrect, how do they perceive this?
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.940]   And we have to acknowledge that without information, they're this natural for people to come to
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.940]   back conclusions.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   Yes.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.540]   And my guess will be that we'll see the Apple as part of a presentation.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.820]   You know, this has happened and a bunch of companies have been affected by this, including
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.060]   Apple and here's how Apple is going to address this.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.900]   Yeah, I would it's so it would look it's it's technically correct to say this has happened
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   to others.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   It's not our fault.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.900]   All of those things.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:37.540]   I think it's so important the kind of semiotics of this, the subtext of this for him to apologize,
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.540]   be honest with you.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.100]   I don't know if I'm going to need to apologize because that that that's there's falling
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.420]   the thing about falling on your sword is sometimes there's a point to it and sometimes
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.660]   you're just putting on a hair shirt.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.940]   You want people to see how much you're willing to suffer to show how serious you think this
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.940]   is.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.500]   I think that I think there's a good opportunity for Apple to ask me to say I don't think it's
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.100]   unlikely they would say this is a problem that affects all kinds of different platforms,
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.740]   but not in a defensive way of saying, Hey, look, it's not us.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.100]   It's just, you know, the way things work.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   Don't be defensive.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.100]   It's wrong.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.540]   But say we can do better away away.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.940]   No, away of them saying that if you have an Android, if you have a Windows phone device,
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.220]   the advice we're about to give you applies to you as well.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   So please pay attention.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.260]   Yeah, we can do better is a good one.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.580]   We have always been highly committed to keeping yours data secure with no company does as
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.260]   much and still it's not enough.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.260]   We're going to do even better.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.140]   It's not necessarily an apology, but it's a commitment that this is a problem.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.900]   And then it's very in this in typical Apple, you say we're going to step up and solve it.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.900]   And then we'll see.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:41.940]   And then if the Apple stock price is anything to to judges by it's gone up.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.460]   So it hasn't heard Apple headline celebrities enjoy Apple products.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:51.180]   I was just I was just thinking about how the old Apple would say, we've made sharing photos
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.620]   to the world as easy as possible.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.020]   Yeah, look at all our famous.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.020]   Easy.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.020]   It is.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.020]   You know what's funny?
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.660]   I mean, I swift on security made this point.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.300]   I wouldn't use an Android phone, but this is none of this came from Android.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.940]   In this case, fragmentation might be advantage.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.940]   Right.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.540]   I mean, but that's the thing is like, like no one is immune to bugs and no one is immune
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.540]   to social engineering.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.660]   You can't design a system to prevent those things because otherwise people who need them
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660]   wouldn't be able to get in.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.660]   Right.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.580]   Well, an Apple is a leader in the high end phone space and who and celebrities Hollywood
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.580]   doesn't have an iPhone.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   Exactly.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.460]   The ones who are paid endorsers for other phones probably isn't often there still a tweet.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.300]   And they go backstage and they tweet from their iPhone.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.260]   So if you've got a target of opportunity, of course, it's going to be the other thing.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   The iPhone.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.780]   So the takeaway once again, an Apple made a statement during this conversation in which
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.740]   they explained that they were taking this very seriously.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.300]   They're working very hard.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:49.180]   They don't believe that the systems iCloud or FMI iPhone were hacked that there is a
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.660]   vulnerability that we should worry about.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.420]   However, everybody should have this takeaway that when you have stuff on the internet,
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.340]   it is potentially vulnerable.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.820]   So a, don't put anything on the internet.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.980]   You don't want anybody to see.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.100]   Be secure your stuff by using good, strong passwords.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.340]   Don't use security questions.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.420]   At least don't use them and answer them properly.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.500]   I always make up answers, non-guessable answers because that's always a problem with celebrities.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.900]   There's so much in public.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   Taylor Swift, not Taylor Swift.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.540]   Wikipedia page, right?
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.900]   Paris Hilton got hacked because she used her dogs.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.980]   We think she used her dog's name in one of the security questions.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   And everybody knows.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.100]   And also if you want to share private photos, use something that is ephemeral and encrypted.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.340]   Use an app that is specific.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.340]   Not Snapchat.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.340]   No.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.380]   There are secure apps.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.900]   You know, it's funny.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:43.140]   I probably shouldn't say this, but there are apps for couples that I use with my couple,
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.100]   my significant other.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.580]   And perhaps because they're not high-profile, those maybe have not been hacked, but that's
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.380]   a real cost for security as well.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.460]   It was a concern as well.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:03.980]   And finally, pay attention because your behavior is absolutely important in all of this.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.900]   The internet isn't public, but it's just like the real world.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.640]   If you're going to go somewhere and you don't want people to see you go there, you take
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   certain precautions.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.620]   If you're going to use something on the internet and you don't want people to know about it,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   you take certain precautions.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.620]   All right.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.620]   We're going to take a break.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.620]   We do have a lot to talk about.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.540]   An Apple reveal is just around the corner and these cats are going there.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.540]   Me.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.540]   I'll be staying back.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.380]   We'll talk about our coverage and what we're going to do.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.660]   Just for you and what we expect to see in Cupertino.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.300]   Think about this way.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   Think about this way, Leo.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:38.020]   You're ripply in the dropship while the colloquial Marines have to go out and deal with the air.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.500]   I'm more like Michael Collins watching Aldrin and Armstrong make history while I rotate
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.500]   around the moon.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.500]   All right.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.340]   He was the one that was almost definitely coming back.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.700]   So they're advantages to each seat in that space.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.220]   I would prefer to put my life on the line and go to an Apple event.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.220]   But okay.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.220]   You can sit there and yell out.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   It's a trap, Leo.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.980]   I showed today brought to you by some really great folks that we love an awful lot.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.900]   IT, Pro, TV.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.740]   Tim and Don over there had been doing this teaching people how to get their certs, get
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:18.420]   their A+ their MCSEs by studying and they were in their great educators.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:23.340]   But they watched what we did here at Twit and they said, you know, maybe this is an opportunity
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.020]   for us to do something more appealing, more fun.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.660]   And they created IT Pro TV pretty much on our model and we were glad to share it with
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   them.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.660]   They use TriCasters.
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.660]   They use similar cameras.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.660]   They use the same microphones.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:40.260]   In fact, if you go to itpro.tv and watch their live feed, you'll see it looks very similar.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.820]   And I think this is great.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.180]   I am personally celebrate this.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:49.780]   It is an easy entertaining approach to online IT training.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.660]   They now have Apple Mac management, by the way, which is awesome.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.700]   They're adding 30 hours of course, where every single week you see their schedule there on
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.100]   the right.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.580]   They're live much of the day during their live broadcast.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.820]   You can chat with them just as you can with us.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:09.260]   There are hundreds of hours of content already up besides the live streaming courses.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:16.100]   Also, they have a Apple Mac management, but they also have Linux, Windows and OS 10 support
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.900]   for desktop servers and more.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.260]   It is a great way to study.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:28.060]   Look at all the courses they have, just the CompTIA, the Apple stuff, the Windows stuff.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.580]   And if you would like to learn, this is probably the most affordable way to do it $57 a month
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.260]   and $570 for an entire year.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:41.060]   That's so much less than going to a technical school to prep for your tests.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.900]   And you can go directly to any part of any of these courses.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.620]   They're broken up by the test chapters.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.020]   It does look awful like Twitter tech TV, I have to say.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.020]   That's Don right there.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.620]   You really couldn't look more like tech TV right there.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   I love it.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.860]   They've also added a new web interface and learning management system so you can track
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   your progress.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.900]   Whether you're subscription, you get free the practice tests.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.660]   That's a $79 value right there.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.940]   They also have, if you don't say, "I don't have a Windows server.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.340]   I don't have the machines."
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:17.740]   They have a virtual system that's really great to be used in any HTML5 browser so that you
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.380]   can actually practice.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.460]   I just love this stuff.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.860]   Corporate accounts also available for departments and companies.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.300]   Check out the corporate group pricing link at the bottom of the pricing page.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.140]   Corporate IT departments have been really quick to jump on this for their team members.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.540]   So whether you're trying to get a cert so you can get ready for your future or become
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:43.660]   a better IT pro or your company looking to train your employees, itpro.tv/macbreak, I
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:50.380]   mentioned it's $57 a month, but of course because they're fans of ours and we're believing
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.380]   them.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.380]   They've got an offer code for you.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.860]   Macbreak 30, that gives you 30% off your subscription not for the first month or year,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.340]   but for the lifetime of your account.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.060]   Now it's less than $40 a month, 399 for the entire year.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.540]   You can't even buy a prep book for that.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.780]   ITpro.tv/macbreak, use a gun in the arm, we're in the fizzes.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.820]   These offer code Macbreak 30 to get 30% off Tim and Donna.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.340]   Great guys.
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.780]   And they do a really good job sneaking into my office and stealing all our stuff.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.580]   And actually I love it.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.540]   They wear keppies, not fizzes.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.540]   So it's not like they're really...
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.540]   Stop.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   No, right.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.540]   It's not.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.540]   They're not Samsung.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.540]   I don't think you should...
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.540]   That's right.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   It's a Roku app like we do.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.900]   It's just such a good solution for people.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.940]   And I've talked to so many people who have used it and have gotten their certs.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.940]   It's just really fabulous.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.980]   All right.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.420]   Week from today, here's what we're going to do.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.420]   The invitations went out.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.820]   What are the invitations?
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.900]   Was it a paper invitation or was it an email?
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   Oh, no, it's just email.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.900]   I wanted a paper.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   I looked like cut out.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.500]   Actually, it's one of the prettiest ones they've sent out.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   It actually made me think, "Gee, if they actually gave me a copy of this on Art Studio,
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.820]   I might actually put that in my office."
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.140]   Because it's very quiet, understated.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.420]   It's also one of the more...
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.420]   Cryptic?
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   Cryptic invitations.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.420]   Wish we could say more.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.180]   Wish we could say more doesn't really give you anything.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.100]   The only speculation I've heard is, "Oh, maybe there's something new with Siri.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.980]   I don't think that's really what they're saying here.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980]   They know perfectly well.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.820]   Everybody knows what's coming."
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.180]   But it's beautiful, I think.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.980]   And boy, I would love to have gotten one because I would go.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.060]   I'm just wanting you to know Apple.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.060]   I would go.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:38.060]   Even though somebody has to stay here in anchor, it could be somebody else.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.700]   But what we're going to do, it's 10 a.m.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.620]   For the first time in a long time, it's back in Cupertino.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.380]   This is where they did the original Mac reveal.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.780]   Remember Steve Jobs and the bow tie pulling the Mac out of the kit?
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.780]   Were you at that?
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.940]   Andy, I was in eighth grade then.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.220]   I am the one here old enough to have actually been there.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.340]   The original iMac reveal was also at the Flint Center in Cupertino.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.340]   This is the first Apple.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.340]   This is at the last one.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   Since then.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   That's since 1998.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.500]   It's been quite a while.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.540]   It's 16 years since they've done it there.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.940]   Why Flint Center?
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.940]   Speculation?
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.540]   It's a big deal of exercise.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.860]   Available of people there.
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.580]   People like to do the Apple Kremlinology thing.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.780]   And it's fun, let's admit it.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.300]   But in reality, a lot of venues are really hard to book.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.740]   They've got other things going on.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.900]   They love doing big events at Moscone West.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.220]   But if there's a trade show book there, sometimes those shows are booked years in advance.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.900]   Can they get your Beboyna theater?
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.260]   Lately they've been using the Beboyna theater which is 350.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.460]   I think they're a little frustrated by the size of it.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.260]   But Town Hall on the Apple campus is also very small.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.380]   Presumably the Apple campus too that their building will have some sort of thunder dome
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.940]   that they'll be able to use instead.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.580]   But in the meantime, the Flint Center, they've also used the theater in downtown San Jose,
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.300]   the California theater for a couple of events.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.820]   I think it was available.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:58.340]   And I think talking to Apple people about WWDC and other events they do in San Francisco,
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.340]   I think they're all down in Cupertino.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.380]   So it's an extra bar of difficulty when you have to come up.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.660]   Everybody has to drive up to San Francisco multiple times to do the setup, to do the
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.140]   rehearsal and all of that.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.420]   So it's some combination of availability and convenience I think.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.820]   And I think the size is a bonus too.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:19.100]   They can invite people who they usually have to turn away.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.660]   The size is still not big enough, by the way, for Leo LaPorit.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.260]   No, the size is still--
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.980]   This speaks a man in pain.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:27.980]   Listen, everybody.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.420]   The size is still not big enough for the demo area.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.980]   And I presume that's what this big white box is that they've been building for several
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:40.620]   weeks outside of the Flint Center is a demo-- I would think a demo area, right?
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:44.260]   That's going to be an interesting problem getting 2,500 people through the hands-on
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.300]   they're going to get, particularly when you see-- Jason and I have both been-- and
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:54.500]   I'm sure Renee have been to Samsung scale events where you have 2,000 2,500 members of
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.380]   press and bloggers, and each one of them wants to try to do a five-minute exclusive
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.020]   YouTube video with a full review of it.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:05.700]   And so there's a line of people hull around every single demo unit.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.620]   And so I'm really curious to see how they're going to manage that.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.460]   I think they're basically going to say, OK, you're in Group A, Group B, Group C.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.460]   Andy has--
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.460]   That table is for you.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.180]   Andy, you've made me flash back to that Samsung event we went to at Radio City Music
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.180]   Hall.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.260]   We just decided to stand on the side for a while and let the media horde descend and
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.260]   then we would get back to it later.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.820]   But I do think this looks like a demo area.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:29.740]   And I saw my good buddy Dan Morin from Macworld mentioned the-- back when they launched the
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.660]   iPod High-Fi, which was kind of a flop.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.660]   But they had like--
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.660]   That was in-- that was at Apple's.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   And they had like a dorm--
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.660]   Upstairs.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.660]   --a common room built up like a dorm room.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.740]   And you look at this big box and you wonder, you know, maybe there's something about the
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:48.180]   home kit stuff or something else that there's actually a demo area where they need to show
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.980]   stuff off to build this whole big thing.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.340]   The box is as tall as the Flint Center, which means there could be two stories in there.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:59.060]   I don't see them building a 20-foot-tall ceiling for no reason.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.340]   Plus, they might need areas to give private briefings to upstairs.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.460]   As opposed to pulling people to another building.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.620]   So this is-- the floor map of this is going to be as fun to speculate about as anything
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.620]   piece of hardware that will actually release.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.900]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.540]   I am stuck here.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.220]   So I will be here at 10 a.m.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.860]   Do we know yet if they're streaming it?
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.380]   They have streamed the last few events.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.860]   Do we know yet if there will be a video streaming?
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   You never know.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.180]   You don't know until the time comes.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.500]   Until like two hours beforehand.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.340]   So no matter what, we will do it.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.700]   In fact, in a way, if they don't stream it, that's better for us because then we can give
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.940]   you a synopsis and you don't-- otherwise, you can just go watch for yourself.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.580]   But Mike Elgin will be with me, Sarah Lane and I.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.660]   And we will do the coverage.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.420]   I expect this is going to be a long one, maybe 10 to noon.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.300]   Yeah, usually a couple hours.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.300]   We--
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.300]   Especially.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.980]   Especially given that we're not expecting them to simply say, hey, look, we've got--
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.220]   we've got-- we've got a-- we've made it flat or hey, look, we've got this new Touch ID system.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.900]   Well, I think we're all expecting not even if they don't necessarily introduce a new
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.300]   product, which I think we all believe that they will.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.860]   This is going to have to be-- we have to explain our thinking behind why we did this the way
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   we did that.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:08.820]   And if they do come up with a wearable, they're going to have to spend a whole-- they're going
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.460]   to have to do citizen cane on as for the beginning, a middle and an end.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.580]   They're going to have to start it off with somebody whispering rosebud, finding out the
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.180]   every single step they took in order to do it because Apple likes to make their message
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:24.380]   really, really clear, not just hear the features of what we made, but here are the choices that
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.820]   we made alongside it.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:31.060]   Remember that the iPad-- the iPad on Vail was as much about netbooks and why they were
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.580]   unsuitable for Apple as much as it was about this particular piece of hardware.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.340]   Man, I just got the invitation in my mailbox.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   This is so exciting.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   You're welcome, Leo.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.340]   Oh.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.180]   It's a forward from Jason Snow.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.540]   I guess that doesn't count, does it?
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   You're going to start a nine.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.540]   You're plus one.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.540]   You can try.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:52.780]   Yeah, send an email to the RSVP address and see what happens.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.980]   When you get some time later on, the studio is all alone and dim.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.460]   Can you sing that song from Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol when he's all alone in the school?
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   I can't.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.780]   And for each hand was made for the world.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.380]   Why don't my finger spin?
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:12.900]   I was thinking the Incredible Hulk, Sad Piano Music, but, you know, whatever.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.140]   Here I am sitting with three people who are all going.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.700]   But somebody has to anchor the coverage.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:19.700]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.620]   That's what I say to myself in my private time.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   Somebody has to be here.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.660]   No, it'll be-- you know what?
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:31.860]   The only reason I like to go-- when it was Steve, of course, you really wanted to go.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.740]   That's the best seat in town.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.740]   Best ticket in town.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.740]   To see Steve Jobs as I did, introduce the iPhone.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.740]   Never forget it.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   It's introduced the iPad.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   Never forget it.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.420]   That was the last time I was invited to an Apple event.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.740]   Tim Cook is not as dynamic, and it's not going to be as dynamic.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:49.060]   But I do feel like this is going to be a very-- am I wrong?
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.500]   Is this going to be a big one?
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.900]   This is a big one.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:56.500]   Not just for that, but if they also choose the state to release iOS 8 or at least say
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.780]   it's going to be released in 10 days, and this is their big opportunity to say, here
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.740]   is everything we put into iOS 8.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:07.580]   Just the stuff that they've showed off in WWDC would be making a really huge, very important
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.580]   keynote.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.380]   But if they have other features, they held back because they didn't know if they're
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.740]   going to be putting it into the final release or not, that will be huge as well.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.740]   And this really is-- I've said this so many times before, but I'm still excited about
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:19.740]   it.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.980]   iOS 8 is the most important thing to happen to the iPhone since I think the first day of
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.980]   release.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.180]   John Gruber, of course, joked that-- he said it was a joke.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.700]   As it turns out, it may not have been a joke that the iWatch would also be announced in
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.700]   September.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.260]   Something nobody thought would happen.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.540]   But then John Pachkowski at Recode confirms it, and Pachkowski is usually pretty good.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.340]   He doesn't say it unless he feels fairly confident that it's true.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.180]   But we should warn you just because they talk about it, A, doesn't mean even they'll show
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.180]   it.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.540]   There's some question about whether they'll show something.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.780]   And B, I think everybody agrees it won't be available this year.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.780]   Is that right?
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:58.260]   In classic Gruber, he responds to John Pachkowski's reference to his first joke with a new joke
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.940]   about mobile payments.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.260]   Can we put joke in air quotes?
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:06.500]   I've been working on a new joke, writes Gruber, about NFC and a new secure enclave where you
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.220]   could store your credit cards so you can pay for things at brick and mortar retail stores
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.260]   just by taking out your iPhone.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:16.780]   But only if it's one of the new iPhones, but no one seems to get my sense of humor.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:21.180]   Now we do see that Apple has apparently been talking to American Express Visa and other
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.260]   charge cards about exactly that.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.260]   And there have been NFC rumors about this for a little while now.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.420]   You have to have NFC, wouldn't you?
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:32.060]   You've got to have something that's readable and programmable so that it can interface with
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   other headphones.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.060]   I think it would be an ethical deal.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.060]   You wouldn't be enough.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.820]   You can't have less terminals, roll wide or using NFC.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.220]   You can't arm twist an entire world doing that.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:46.380]   I also saw one of those things that sort of distracts your thinking for a good hour after
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.500]   you've someone suggested a couple of weeks before keynote.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:53.620]   It's like, oh, isn't it interesting that now if this backplate is accurate as an actual
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:58.100]   iPhone 6 backplate, maybe the reason why the Apple logo is now a cutout is because that's
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:04.060]   where the NFC transponder is, to give people a not only transparent for NFC, but also to
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:09.580]   say this thing right here, here's where you line up the NFC for the target.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.900]   Apparently Jim Dallrimple had a one line.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.020]   I don't know if I can repeat it on one liner in response to that.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.020]   I'm trying to, by the way, I just want to say Apple, OK, you don't have to invite me
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.020]   to this event.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.660]   But I am going to be in London at the end of the month.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:31.620]   If I could go to the Placido Domingo concert at the roundhouse last day of the iTunes festival,
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.620]   that would make up for it.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.820]   I'm just saying.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.820]   I'm just saying.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:36.820]   Good to know.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.420]   I can't find Dallrimple's.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.020]   Oh, wait, was a tweet.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.020]   All right.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.020]   What does it say?
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.660]   Was it a yep or a no, or a do you?
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.860]   See, as an aside, now that when people when all these commentators talk about joking, I
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.420]   think that's like that move in chess where you move your piece, but you're keeping your
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   finger on it.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.020]   So you say, OK, I haven't really moved.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.820]   I haven't really said it's going to happen yet.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.820]   I still take this back.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:03.820]   But this has been Gruber's shtick, and it's actually pretty darn funny, which is that
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.020]   he drops in facts.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.940]   He's done this three or four times where he drops in a fact and doesn't say anything
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.540]   about like my sources are telling me or a little bird told me he's like, oh, that's
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.060]   going to be really funny when they unveil that thing in September.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.860]   And then he just moves on and everybody's like, wait, did he just say what I thought
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:20.860]   he said?
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.860]   It was a joke.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:26.940]   In fact, at this point, Gruber mostly disclaims when he's speculating because he knows people
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.380]   believe that he's got access to all the secrets.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.820]   So he'll usually say, look, I'm just speculating here when he did his big post about math,
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.020]   about the size of the iPhone screens and how they might work.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.780]   He said, look, I just did this myself.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:39.780]   I like that.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.780]   I don't have that.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.780]   That was John nerding out.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.780]   And that was a lot of fun.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.780]   My vagarean theorem.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.460]   And I think we haven't seen any reason to disagree with it.
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.700]   So here's Dow Rimples tweet, which I can't read, but holy poop people, hang on to your
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.700]   hats.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.700]   This is going to be a wild ride.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.860]   And it was posted August 28, just four days ago.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:03.380]   And I think probably what happened is Dow Rimples got his sources to tell him what they're
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.580]   going to see.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:09.940]   If we go by, I mean, the excitement level before WWDC was palpable.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:14.100]   And it is, if it's possible, it's even more palpable now, which is usually a good indicator.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:19.420]   Is this, so it's going to be, it's going to be on the order of an iPad announcement or
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.420]   an iPhone.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.740]   It's going to be a new product, right?
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.220]   That's a new category.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.220]   We know that.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.220]   Yes.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.780]   I mean, the iPhone announcement in general is the biggest announcement.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.340]   If the biggest announcement Apple will make any year, it's their biggest product by far.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.340]   It's their most important product.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.460]   It has worldwide appeal.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:38.660]   When you look at the stats, I can tell you from Macworld's perspective, it's by far the
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.860]   event with the most interest in any given year from Apple.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.940]   And then you throw in the potential for this new product where Apple is using all the attention
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.220]   that is always devoted to the iPhone to launch this new product, which is really smart.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.580]   If that happens, it'll be even bigger.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.140]   It's already just with the iPhone and iOS.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.180]   It's going to be the biggest Apple event of the year.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:03.500]   And if they throw in this wearable on top of it, it will be the biggest event since the
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   iPad launch.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.180]   WWDC is excitement for us, the iPhone.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.660]   The fall announcement is the, that level excitement for regular civilians who you can't
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.780]   explain why extensions are such a big deal for this operating system.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.500]   But you see that here is the new phone.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   It is bigger.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   It's coded with this miracle device.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.300]   And when you flip it over, now this can communicate with other devices that I couldn't
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   communicate with before.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.260]   Look, shiny, shiny, shiny, and exactly 1.8 millimeters thinner.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:27.260]   How do we do it?
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:28.260]   Alpha magic.
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:32.540]   Guys, in regular life, does anybody ever ask you about anything except wins the new iPhone
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.540]   coming out?
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.540]   That's the one that I hear.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:38.300]   I don't hear what about the new iPad, what about new Mac, what about the new version of
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   OS 10?
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.100]   No, it's what's the new iPhone.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.100]   What's in the new iPhone?
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.700]   That is what we're going to know.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.580]   I get a lot of questions about Mac books.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.420]   I would probably even say I get more questions about Mac books than I.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.260]   What is wrong with your friends?
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:58.460]   My friends and my family are thinking about spending $1,000 or $1,500 on a device that
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.260]   doesn't have a regular release.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.140]   I'm asked for advice with the iPhone.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.900]   None of the people I know are even in the market for a new phone until their contract
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   is up.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.700]   I get asked for advice like that, and that's fine.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.020]   But it's like standard conversation fare.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.460]   Everybody's just talking about the iPhone.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.460]   And that's different I think.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460]   I'm being asked for specific advice.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.740]   I hear it all the time.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740]   It's amazing.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.980]   So let's talk about what we think we know about Tuesday.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.500]   Obviously, we'll all find out.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:32.780]   But if I'm going to make the bingo card, I need to know what you expect to hear.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.420]   People stop doing that.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.820]   I want to see a bingo card again.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.300]   So you know where you put a checkmark next to the boxes.
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.300]   Seems pretty clear.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:49.020]   One new iPhones, a 4.7 inch and a 5.5 inch, possibly with the 2X3X resolution.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.060]   John Gruber calculated.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.980]   The rumor is though that only the 4.7 will be available this month, probably what?
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.980]   10 days after the announcement.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.900]   They've done that in the past where they've had an esoteric like higher end model that's
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.580]   ended up trailing the main model and wouldn't surprise me.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.740]   That'd kill me because I want the 5.5 and a half.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.980]   Did that with the iPad last year?
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.420]   With the Retina iPad Mini last year came out after the iPad.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.940]   And Gruber's math is interesting, slight tangent, but this is Mac Break Weekly.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:24.380]   The Retina MacBook Pro did something that previous Macs had never done, which is it's
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.140]   got like a virtual screen resolution.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   I DPI.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.420]   It basically paints a picture in its video card that is larger than the actual resolution
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.660]   of the screen and then it scales it down.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.940]   And anybody who's used a computer over the years will think, "Oh my God, scaling down
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.740]   pictures on a laptop, that's going to look terrible."
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.420]   But at Retina DPI, you can't tell.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.420]   You literally can't tell.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:50.820]   Plus if it's a multiple, it's not 1.8 times, but two times the scaling can be done much
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.820]   better.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820]   Right.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.820]   And if you've got some pixels that are a little fuzzy, they're so small that it essentially
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820]   becomes...
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820]   I'll vastly.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.180]   I have a 4K display on my Mac Pro and I use HD, high DPI.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.980]   I have a 1080.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:04.980]   And then when it gets...
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.860]   So I've never seen anything so crisp.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.860]   It's gorgeous.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.220]   So it's not necessary.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.700]   We have been living, iPhone users have been living in a world where it's a one-to-one
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.660]   pixel to dot ratio.
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.860]   They've not done the high DPI.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.820]   And so if you've got a screen that's got a resolution of X, then what the video card
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.140]   does is draw every pixel.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.860]   And what the speculation that John Gruber did and that some people who are very familiar
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.300]   with pixel by pixel art, like the icon factory and Craig Hockenberry have talked about is
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:35.460]   this possibility that they're going to take the same approach with iOS devices, at least
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.300]   in part, which is have it be larger and then just scale it down to fit the screen.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.020]   Because at some point the screen's so high res that you'll never tell the difference.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.860]   What's the impact on battery life and CPU though when you do that?
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   Isn't that all that?
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.860]   It does.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.860]   It has an impact, but these will be bigger phones.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.820]   And so it may be that they're shooting for battery life that's similar.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   I hope they're not.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.820]   That's too much.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.820]   But typically what they do, isn't it?
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.820]   They've never...
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   The battery life is kind of a constant as they increase the...
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.300]   They're solving it for that battery life.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.980]   It's gone down a couple times, but they bring it back up when they do the S version.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.980]   Right.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.780]   And what I think that bears mentioning is that I think part of the whole redesign of iOS
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:12.380]   7 was to create user interface elements that aren't as intensive as drop shadows and
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.660]   gloss that have to be recalculated or bitmaps that don't work.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.100]   They created a user interface that if they did have to interpolate and scale up and down,
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:24.220]   it will still look great because there's nothing but precision in that interface.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.740]   Sapphire on both?
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.260]   Some people say Sapphire only on the big one.
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.780]   I don't know.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   Nobody really knows about the...
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.260]   They know they've got a big factory in like Mesa, Arizona.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.340]   I drove past it once on the way to the Phoenix airport.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.140]   I was like, "Hey, Apple factory."
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.980]   And I think eventually, yeah, they're going to code everything in Sapphire, but whether
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.980]   the whole screen gets it now or whether it's stuck on the touch ID and stuff is a...
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.340]   It is currently a touch ID in the camera, let's say.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.340]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.100]   And I wonder about that Apple logo on the back if it's truly a cutout with NFC if they
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.300]   might make that scratch resistant to it.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   I'm...
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:03.220]   I continue to be unconvinced that Sapphire is going to be as big a deal as...
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.220]   It...
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.980]   Other people are making out to be because when it first...
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.860]   When those rumors start flowing around, I start talking to people I know who are in
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.980]   the glass industry, not people who make specifically phones, phone screen covers, but people who
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.780]   are engineers who work in that industry and they're telling me that you can...
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.660]   Sapphire will be more scratch resistant, but will it be so...
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.540]   It'd be hard for them from their perspective, at least a year ago, to produce a cover that
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.660]   would be better than...
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.900]   It's markedly better than whatever is in the Gorilla Glass product right now.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.900]   I think it's Apple's...
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.900]   It's a nice thing.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.300]   It really wants to control every bit of the chain it can, right?
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.300]   Sure.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.300]   It ultimately like to make your own ships as well.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.380]   It's nice to have something that other phones companies do not have, just like how originally
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.660]   they were the only ones that were doing solid state memory storage for all their music players
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.500]   because they were the only company that had that much memory in storage.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.020]   Well, most recently, 64-bit, right?
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.060]   One of the only 64-bit mobile players.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.060]   What are the new frontiers?
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.300]   What are the frontiers left in smartphones, right?
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.580]   Because they're all pretty good and pretty fast and all that.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.340]   It's things like impact resistance and better battery life.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.740]   Glare actually is something that I've heard some rumors about that Apple may actually
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.900]   be trying to work on glare because the iPad is hard to see in bright light.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.700]   When I went on my beach vacation this summer, everybody had kindles.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.460]   I have a kindle and it was kind of like...
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.460]   There's no glare.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460]   It's amazing, but you go to the beach.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.340]   You guys have a kindle tablet, but the E-ink.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.820]   The E-ink because there's no glare problem there.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:29.500]   But a lot of material science, I think, is the next generation of things that we're
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.420]   going to see from phone makers and tablet makers because whether the Sapphire will be
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.460]   the solution or not, I don't know.
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:39.100]   But it's interesting that Apple thinks it's us solution because they've got this factory
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.940]   spinning up to build this stuff.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.820]   That's not a good point, Jason.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.580]   The reason why when I hear rumors about curved screens, the things that get overlooked is
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.700]   that if you have a flat screen, you can tilt it so that the glare is eliminated.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.420]   When you have a curved screen, there is always going to be a tangent somewhere on that curve
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.780]   where you're going to get nothing but glare.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:01.620]   That's why I don't know if the level of rubs a good use of curved glass.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:05.780]   I've used the curved LG Flex.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   Big deal.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.780]   It's cool.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:12.140]   The curve on a display is not as important as what you do.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.260]   Again, any technology is only as good as how well it's implemented.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:19.060]   You can curve the glass so that at the edge, at the non-display portion, it's smoother for
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:22.100]   when you do your persistent back gestures and things like that.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.580]   You don't want the curve on the display where, as Andy said, the photons blast right back
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.580]   into your eyes.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580]   Other rumors, better speaker.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.580]   That would be welcome.
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.140]   The speakers have not been much improved.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:36.620]   In fact, now you've got HTC with excellent front-facing speakers.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:42.180]   You don't appreciate how bad the speakers are on any other phone or how useful it is
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.700]   to have good speakers on a phone until you use the HTC One and you realize that, "Oh,
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.580]   I'm actually not even bothering to connect this to my Bluetooth speakers.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.820]   I can act for listening to podcasts on my desktop."
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:55.140]   That's actually perfectly fine.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.620]   Who else was going to do front-facing speakers?
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.620]   I saw another company.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.860]   Well, they had the HTC Aria 2, the original Windows phone launch, and they had those massive
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.020]   speakers on the top of it, you know.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020]   Will they have stereo speakers?
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.060]   I wonder if they'll have, if eventually, I don't know this year, but eventually the
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.980]   Beats brand becomes the audio brand.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:12.980]   That's true.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:17.100]   But that really sent HTC the top, didn't it, when they actually did it?
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.540]   Again, it's implementation.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540]   It's not idea.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.860]   It might be more about processing than about putting in different speakers, though.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.060]   Hey, will they talk about it?
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.060]   They have some good audio cooking.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   Will they talk about Beats at all?
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.820]   Will there be Beat headphones in the iPhone box?
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.820]   It's a good question.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:34.820]   I think there's probably going to be another event this fall that I suspect is when they'll
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.820]   talk about Beats.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.820]   Okay.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.220]   Will you see Dre on stage, Jimmy Iaveen?
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.020]   If they do that event and that's their more entertainment themed event and it's for the
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.260]   holidays and it's got the iPad announcement, that would be the time for those guys, I
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.260]   think.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:54.140]   I would put Dre in FaceTime Jail and just say, "Let's not make an old adre anymore."
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.620]   I wonder if they'd even do that at a club or do it at a music festival rather than doing
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.300]   a regular Apple keynote style event.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.500]   Because there's so much content they have to put into that.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.180]   That's about a lot more than, "Here is a new button you have in iTunes."
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:10.260]   I wonder if they're also going to want to start managing the brand by saying, "This is
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.700]   not a tech company that now has a music thing.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.540]   This is now a music culture that Apple is now part of."
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.540]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.860]   I want to talk a little bit more about wearables.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:25.780]   A really good article about Apple's PR machine by Mark Gurman in 9-5.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.740]   I thought that was excellent.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:34.660]   A few other things on our agenda.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.820]   Of course, our picks of the week two coming up.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.620]   Renee Ricci is here from iMore.com.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.180]   Soon to be here, here.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.620]   When are you coming down?
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.180]   I'm coming down on Sunday.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.980]   I look forward to that.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   Andy Inako also here.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.060]   Soon to be here, here.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.300]   The thin white duke is behind you because...
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:59.860]   Because whatever the cool deficit I have, it's like playing the same team with Shaq and
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   teaming up to do 120 points.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   That's about a coolness.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.100]   We're now basically in the top of the bow.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.860]   He has excellent rebound numbers.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860]   There you go.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:11.060]   He's a killer in the pain.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.820]   Especially when the pain is on his face in the shape of a lightning bolt as Ziggy Stardust.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.900]   Ziggy played guitar.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.740]   Ziggy played.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:22.180]   That is one of my all-time favorite albums.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.980]   And of course, we love having him here.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.740]   Jason Snell of the incomparable...
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.300]   I'm here here.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.420]   Your podcast Empire is growing all the time.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.420]   If you go to the...
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   What is it?
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.420]   The incomparable.com, yeah.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.180]   And of course, he has a date at IDG.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.140]   I don't know what he does there.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.140]   Oh, Editor-in-Chief of Macworld, okay.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.140]   Yeah, minor thing.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.940]   How long have you been at Macworld?
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   15 years.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   No, 17 years.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   Actually, 17 years.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.940]   So you started as a cub reporter?
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.580]   I started as Ziff Davis at MacUser, and then when they sold that off to IDG.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.220]   That's what we met, I think, probably.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.220]   And then was it Macworld?
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.220]   And we did Tech TV.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   Used to come over all the time and do little bits and things.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:06.580]   So not 17 years now, Editor-in-Chief for about eight or nine in there.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.100]   Always Jason and I became friends because Jason was the only one who was the only one
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.620]   who was the only person I knew who knew HTML markup and I was writing code for to set
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.060]   up a blog and so like...
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.060]   Jason!
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   I tried to sign a rip, but it won't center.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.740]   If back in the Mac user days, it was like me and Chris Breen and Andy were sort of...
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.900]   We're the ones who were left alive.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   Look at...
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900]   My goal is always...
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.620]   We're like the surviving members of the Who.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.620]   That's right.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.780]   If you get new drummers, new bass, kind of rotate it and out.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.620]   Yeah, always a new drummer.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.620]   They self-destruct.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:40.180]   No, it's always been my goal with all the shows to have kind of the most authoritative voices
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.180]   in a sector and I don't think you can get more authoritative than Renee Richie, Andy
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.180]   and Ocko and Jason Snow.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.180]   I love this group.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.180]   That makes me pretty happy.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.180]   I always love being here with this group.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.180]   We think...
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.340]   We're not sure yet, but we think we're going to be able to get a camera and some sort of
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.020]   magical streaming mechanism down to Cupertino.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:02.020]   So what I anticipate happening, you're not going to make it two and a half hours away.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.020]   Plus there's going to be a demo.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.220]   So there's no way you're going to get back here in time for a Mac break weekly.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.900]   So I'm sorry to say next week's Mac break weekly, it'll be the B team.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.260]   But the second unit, I don't know who it's...
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.700]   I don't even know what it's going to be.
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.660]   It's whoever wasn't invited to this event.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:18.660]   Me.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:24.380]   But I hope we'll be able to get you after the demo room or maybe even in the demo room,
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.100]   depending on what kind of permissions we can get.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.860]   Because I would love to get a stream of whatever they're showing off there.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:36.380]   But at least we'll get your thoughts afterwards, whether it's one of you two of you or all
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.860]   three of you, I would love to do that.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.100]   And if you see Waa as you can pull him over, we like him too.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.340]   Our show today brought to you by Hover.com.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:50.620]   Hover is the way to buy, manage and control your domain names.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.780]   It's what I use.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.820]   Now of course I've been registering domain names for years and I was with other registrars,
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.060]   but I moved everything to Hover.com.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.500]   They have a concierge service that will do that for you free, which is awesome.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.180]   It just gets it all over there.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.260]   You pay 10 bucks per domain and that extends the domain for a year, so it's a really good
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.260]   deal.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.580]   You'll see when you go, you know, just invite you to go to Hover.com and just play with
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:16.580]   it a little bit.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:20.060]   You don't even have to buy anything, but just to see how quick and easy it is to find
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.500]   a domain name.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.540]   You don't have 18 different up.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540]   Be careful.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:29.220]   You might actually buy it because it's so quick and easy, they automatically give you
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:34.620]   the things you want, who is privacy is included free on every domain, a custom email.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:38.780]   You get a smart control panel, which helps you manage DNS and things like that.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.980]   And by the way, if you need it, the best customer support anywhere, they're very well
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.140]   known for their no wait, no hold, no transfer phone service.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.300]   When you call, you're going to get a real person who's empowered to help.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:56.180]   And you see they have a lot of interesting now domains, things like .club and .ninja.guru,
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.980]   not just about anything.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:01.860]   Of course, they still got the .com, the .net, you know, all .org, all the ones that you
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.860]   want.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:09.100]   But I think people are starting to open up to the idea that, you know, maybe .clinic is
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:16.140]   that I want to, I want to do, I got an idea for a new social network where everybody is
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:24.540]   verified, like with a cert so that there's no, there's no trolling, there's no anonymity.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.420]   Everybody owns their own words.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.020]   And I was thinking of calling it, you know, verified .com.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:35.420]   Obviously, that's gone, but you know, maybe we could quickly register Brian verified .club.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.380]   And then you could be in the verified club.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.380]   Would that be good?
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.300]   I'm just thinking this is why I have so many domain names.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.660]   You get these ideas, you run over to hover.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.140]   Boom, you got it.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.500]   You've registered it.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:51.660]   Plus the transfer service means moving everything over there is completely painless.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.380]   I just love hover .com.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:57.140]   If you do decide to buy a domain name, we're going to get 10% off your first purchase with
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.260]   the offer code MBW nine Mac break weekly, September 9th month.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:08.300]   So MBW nine when you buy hover .com.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.300]   You like that idea.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.380]   I just registered Snell dot zone.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.380]   On hover.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.380]   So isn't it awesome?
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.380]   You can fall into the Snell zone now.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.020]   It's Snell zone.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.140]   I used hover to register what could be the single greatest domain name of all time that
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.660]   I was shocked that was still available.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.420]   And just look, just like you Lee, I'm waiting for the right thing to attach to.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:28.420]   Bring it on.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.420]   Good.
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.420]   Not to have.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.300]   And if you don't want to type the incomparable .com, you can also just go do the butter dot
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.300]   zone.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300]   The butter.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300]   The butter zone.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.300]   The butter zone.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.780]   It's an inside joke, but yeah, it's easy to remember the butter zone.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.780]   The butter.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.220]   Sadly, butter dot zone is not available.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.380]   So I had to buy the butter.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.220]   I'm getting verified dot zone.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.460]   That's awesome.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.140]   I could also get verified dot Mo.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.860]   I don't know if Curly and Larry are also available, but.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:57.060]   Where's that most tavern Mo from the Simpsons?
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:02.100]   Oh, maybe it's verified dot FM verified photos verified pictures.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.140]   See, when that be awesome, these are actual domain names.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.140]   They work.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.140]   They do.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.900]   They do verified social.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.900]   God, I get that.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.140]   This is my new.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.220]   I'm going to create a social network just like that.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.220]   Just everybody's verified.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.740]   We were there at the beginning fellows.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.740]   This would be.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   How hard could that be?
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.060]   It's on the tree like a Twitter, but ever.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.580]   But you can't be on it unless you send me a picture of you with your driver's license
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.020]   and a new and today's newspaper.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.620]   Wouldn't that be?
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.460]   And then you would only enter newspapers.
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.780]   I don't know why nobody's done this.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.260]   I know Google kind of sort of, but they're Google.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.260]   You can't do it with Google.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:41.500]   It has to be some place out there.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.740]   Verified holdings, verified associates, verified ventures.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.740]   Verified one.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:47.740]   You should make it.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:48.740]   You should make it more difficult.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.620]   You should make it more difficult as there are more users.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:55.460]   So the first time, like the first thousand users only hold a pen or his paper, the first
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.300]   10, after that 10,000 years have to hold up two newspapers.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.860]   Once you get to a million, you basically have to cover a wall.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.860]   FBI background check.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   How about verified.wtf?
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.340]   That's available.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.300]   Should I get?
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.140]   Should I go for that one?
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.940]   Verified.nigio.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.740]   Verified.rocks getting that.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.540]   See this is why actually the problem with the hover ads, they cost me more than I make.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:22.140]   The amount of money I spend on the hover ad, verified, is that available?
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.180]   I don't know.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.180]   I'm looking.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.500]   Oh, Lucy, I'm verified, HIPAA verified.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.500]   That's good.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:31.500]   All right.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.700]   I just spent 90 bucks.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.700]   Only 90 bucks, Leo.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.140]   You've only spent 90 bucks in all of this joy.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.140]   It's mine forever.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.300]   I love it.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.580]   Who is privacy built in?
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.700]   And if I want, I can have mailboxes and all of that.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.700]   I love it.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.700]   I appreciate your spending.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.780]   Are you like me?
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:53.780]   When you get a list of all the domain names that you've bought, is that a browser history
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.180]   on every good idea you had?
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.180]   And what I've used.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180]   Never used.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180]   I've been followed through on it.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180]   Yep.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180]   Yep.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.180]   Yep.
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.900]   And because I have an account, I'm logged in.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.660]   I've got, oh, I got to look at the CVV.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.420]   All right.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.020]   Can you just pause the show for a minute while I'm...
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.980]   Pull over to the side of the show.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.900]   I just want to buy these domain names.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.900]   You don't mind.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.060]   This is the greatest hover ad ever, I'm saying.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.060]   Okay, there we go.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.060]   Done.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.060]   All right.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:23.060]   Let's talk about...
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.420]   Should we talk more about wearables?
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   We do...
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.060]   First of all, we aren't saying I watch anymore.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.540]   We're saying wearable, right?
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.540]   Sure.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540]   Why?
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.540]   Is that because the hat's going to be real?
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.540]   You're smart hat.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.540]   Smart hat.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   Oh, man.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   I give you a lot of credit, Jason, when that's...
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540]   Smart hat's smart fizzes, to be particular.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.540]   It's...
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.860]   I think people are still wondering about this activity tracking stuff.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:49.900]   And with the health kit stuff that's in iOS 8 and Tim Cook talking about how interested
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.340]   he was in the Nike fuel band.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.340]   Right.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340]   Well, he's on Nike's board.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.900]   I think people are starting to feel like the story can't just be, "Hey, it's a watch
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.820]   with notifications on it and needs to have some other story."
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:02.820]   Yeah, I've got that.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:03.820]   That's my Android Wear watch.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:04.820]   Are your pebble watches still wearing?
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.820]   Exactly.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.820]   I'm still wearing it.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.220]   It's really looking retro now.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.220]   Yeah, sure.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.380]   It's going to have some retro appeal.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380]   Can't wait to replace it.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.780]   I don't want a fashion watch.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:19.060]   I know this, by the way, the Moto 360 LG's new R, which looks beautiful.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.060]   You don't want that, Leo.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060]   I don't?
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.260]   No, because when you start rendering text on that thing, you have no space anymore.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.620]   They can't make it circular text.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.700]   They're going to have a couple of characters based on the median line of that.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.540]   How do you flow an article or something?
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.340]   Well, I don't read articles on my watch.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.180]   Well, no, but that dooms it's going to be a watch.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.180]   Okay.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:37.180]   I will likely...
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.500]   Actually, there's a Motorola event in Chicago on Thursday that I'll be attending.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:44.380]   So I expect that I will have one on that day to finally take a look at.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:49.060]   And I have to say there's been so much negative stuff written about it at this point.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:56.700]   Mostly speculation on why a certain person doesn't think it's a good idea that I'm almost...
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.740]   It almost seems like that sickly dog at the pound that I wanted to see why I shouldn't
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.420]   adopt this one because if you're being abused this much, maybe there's something...
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.900]   Maybe you just need some love.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.700]   I don't know.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:13.180]   I've warned the big chunky square ones and I'm kind of hard to get used to the big chunky
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.180]   square ones.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.340]   The small chunky square ones, like the ones from Pebble, those are fine.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.420]   So I'm curious to see how well they can use that round screen.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.420]   I feel like...
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.420]   I feel like...
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.420]   If Apple does this...
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.740]   First of all, we've seen that it may cost as much as $400.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.740]   That's rank speculation.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.580]   I bet even Apple doesn't know what it's going to cost.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:31.580]   Well, so the thing about that...
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:32.580]   That sounds like a subterfuge.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   ...subtifuge.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.220]   There's two elements to that.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.020]   One is that when the rumors for the iPad came out, the rumor was $1,000.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.020]   Yes.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.020]   Apple got to announce it $500.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.340]   But the other thing is that Apple's wearables, their current wearables, run Pixel and can't
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:45.340]   connect to the internet.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.860]   They're called iPods and they can clip on.
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.740]   They have various forms of clips historically for those.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:54.420]   And Apple needs something that will take over for that dying device that is of iCloud
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.100]   and iOS time of that age.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.780]   And this is where all the wearables...
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.700]   It's not impossible that within a couple of years we'll have a displayless wearable
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:06.020]   that looks like a band, we'll have one that has a square display on it, we'll have one
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.100]   that's higher end, we'll have one that maybe is incredibly fashionable.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:14.940]   So you have all the price points from 50 to 200 to 400 to maybe a Mac Pro aspirational
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.420]   Eve San Laurent-esque wearable device.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.260]   The family makes more sense for these products.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.260]   Yeah, for way further on down the road.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:26.980]   I keep moving my thoughts back to the idea of a really good fitness band that's...
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:30.980]   Whose big selling point is that it's exceptionally well integrated to everything that the phone
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:32.460]   does.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:36.500]   And on my own personal and you not go talk about Apple Wearables Bingo card, the one
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:41.300]   that you get for free is I don't see Apple making a wearable that you can sell to a woman
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.180]   as easily as you could to a man.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:47.900]   And to me at this point in 2014 or 15, that means forget about the display, forget about
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.180]   battery life, just make something that has a big bundle of sensors.
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:58.180]   So if all it did was fitness tracking and also proximity to other Apple devices and cool
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.700]   things that could be done in Yosemite or iOS 8 to take advantage of the fact that it
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:06.220]   knows you're standing in front of this Apple TV at this juncture, that could be worth
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.660]   50 bucks or 100 bucks of anyone's money.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.340]   I love the idea.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.460]   Renee mentioned Subterfuge earlier.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:20.260]   I really did mean that iPad rumor of a thousand, which I think was a leak made so that Apple
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.500]   could come up with a price that blew people away.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:28.060]   And when I see these stories about the watch or whatever it is being 400 or $450, I get
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.060]   that same vibe.
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.460]   That's a price that's put out there so that when they come in under the people will be
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.620]   surprised by it.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.820]   And you mentioned the iPod.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   This may not happen.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:42.580]   I thought that the perfect name for the iPad was iBook because they had retired that name.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:46.100]   And I do still have this feeling of like, what would you call this wearable?
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:49.460]   And I keep thinking maybe iPod is the name for it.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.100]   Oh, or maybe this call it Apple where.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.100]   They did it anywhere.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.100]   You got to Android where I don't know.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.700]   So on that basis, I'm looking for I think they want to get something non-techy about
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   it.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.820]   But one comment on that price point that rumored thousand dollar price point on the iPad.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:09.740]   At the time, I was saying that if you believe that you're a dope, that's way too much.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.740]   They can't sell it for that much.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.940]   I keep seeing I think a few months ago, we're talking about rumors that the first wearable
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.580]   that Apple does is going to be a very elegant design watch that will cost $1,000.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.980]   And I dismissed that as being absolutely ridiculous.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.540]   So I don't think that anybody's sending an expectation of that ridiculous price point.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.820]   We just we absolutely don't know this.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.940]   The only thing you say at this point, we have no idea.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.140]   400 is what Samsung charges for some of its watches.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.580]   I don't think 400 is what depends what it does for you, right?
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   The value that it gives you.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:44.020]   What's really clear and I'm very curious if Apple can change this is that any watch is
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.020]   a luxury.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.020]   It's not a must have item.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.020]   Yes.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.100]   It's an extra that you it's an accessory you might want.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   Yes.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.100]   Like better pair of headphones.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.380]   That's something everybody needs.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.980]   Can Apple change that?
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   Should Apple change that?
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.180]   I think that's what goes behind some of the wearables talk about about not a watch but
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:05.620]   a wearable is the fitness stuff actually is really interesting and sensors and integrating
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.100]   it and seeing how you sleep.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.900]   Well, they still have notifications and all of that too.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.900]   I don't know.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:13.100]   I mean, this is this is why it's everybody's sort of fascinated to see what Apple's going
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.700]   to do because there's a whole menu of things that Apple can choose from.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:20.100]   But which ones do they think are the ones that will work?
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:25.180]   And maybe the case is that nobody's done the fitness wearable right up to now and Apple's
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:28.140]   presence is going to, they will have cracked it.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.780]   But it is hard to see something that's just a watch with notifications or just a fitness
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:38.020]   band as being this category defining big new direction for Apple.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.900]   There's something missing from the story.
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.060]   That's what I was saying earlier and I wasn't trying to be mean about the round wearables
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.300]   but those are primarily watches because you still have to render the screen and you're
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:50.060]   basically cutting off pixels and you're limiting what it can do as a computing device.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:54.260]   And Apple maybe will make one one day but we don't have a lot of round digital displays
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:56.780]   in the computing world and that's probably for a reason.
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.980]   I mean, so what we look like is either.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.140]   Well, we also didn't have a whole lot of multi-touch displays up until a certain point
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.980]   and then there was a reason for them to exist.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:04.980]   Well, that's it.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.740]   It's got to have a reason and right now the reason is aesthetic because it looks really
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.780]   great when you put it into watch mode.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:14.300]   But to Jason's point and we had a really good panel at Macworld that Jason hosted is
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:18.660]   the, you know, the Apple TV is not a leg product for Apple.
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:19.660]   It is not a main product.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:25.100]   It's a product that makes the ecosystem better and an eye watch and I think it was Ben Behreno
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:29.060]   did the math and eye watch is going to be very hard to move a needle for Apple because
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.460]   you can't sell enough of them at a high enough margin to significantly impact something as
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.100]   big as an iPhone class business.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.860]   But what you can do is make a product that makes owning an iPhone better that makes being
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:44.380]   involved in Apple's ecosystem better and that's a family of products and that can include
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:48.200]   off the top of my head logging which is where you have health kit, controlling which is
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.980]   where you have home kit, the authentication which is where you have past kit or whatever
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:55.260]   they call the new mobile payment stuff and things like notifications.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.380]   I've heard about the other three.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:00.060]   I haven't heard about notifications much which is interesting to me because that's mostly
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.620]   what I heard about when it came to Android where.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.860]   Remember that I think that all the wearables that I've used and I will include Google Glass
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   in that.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.140]   It seems as though there are two things that I value about them.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:16.300]   One is sensor data but the other is the ability to keep my phone in my pocket unless I absolutely
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.300]   need it.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.240]   So once they crack the problem of having a decent screen, I find that what I love about
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.080]   the Pebble is not all the apps that I may or may not install on it but the simple fact
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.040]   that when I hear a feel of buzzing in my side pocket, I can simply go like this and that's
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.920]   all I have to do because I can keep my phone in my pocket.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.000]   So I think that if even if it is maybe underwhelming, whatever wearable they do at the very beginning
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.920]   and I agree that I don't think I have any idea really what they're going to be doing.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.440]   If all it does is triumphantly launch an entirely new product line, that will be enough for
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.440]   Apple.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.220]   Just like the original iPod led to the iPhone and then the iPhone led to the iPad even though
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:59.080]   looking back, the iPod was just a much more stylish and more useful version of something
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.700]   that already existed as a digital music player.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.620]   I'm under selling the iPod.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:08.400]   I know but the point is that if all this does is kick off a new brand, call it again, Apple
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.000]   Wear or Apple strap or whatever they want to call it.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.960]   If all it does is establish this brand is here's something here's something affordable
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.440]   right now or something that the really, really hit people with lots of money will want to
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.640]   buy but boy, the rest of you come back in a year because we're going to keep building
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   and building and building.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.280]   This is not an Apple high-fi where we're going to have to feel snarky questions.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.920]   So still throw it all your still happy you throw it all your stereo.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.360]   Is there a precedent for that though?
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.120]   Andy, I think in every respect the iPhone the iPhone got better but we didn't know it
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.120]   was going to get better.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.160]   It seemed like it was great from the day one iPad.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]   Same thing iPod.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   Same thing.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.200]   Is there a precedent for coming out with something that is okay but we're going to make it great
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   next year?
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   That doesn't seem like Apple's way.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.600]   The original iPhone didn't sell that well.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.040]   The original iPad didn't sell that well.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.640]   It was as they went to future generations.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.440]   iPhone 3GS was twice as fast but half the but much lower price and the iPad 2 was the
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.760]   most was when it hit mainstream when you know I started seeing my high school teachers
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   lining up.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.400]   So that is a precedent then.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.040]   Apple's Apple knows what they're going to do.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.440]   The Apple works three to four years ahead.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.560]   So they're building this the same way when they built the iPhone if you go back and look
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.040]   at the project experience purple prototypes that Johnny I've built they look like what
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.080]   it took Apple right all the iPhone 4 to get to they know where they're iPad air to get
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.080]   their roadmap.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080]   They know where they're going.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   It takes a while.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.600]   Well, you know, I don't want to spend a lot of time speculating because it's only a week
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.320]   away and I think we will know a lot more next week.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.080]   Yes, I think we will.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.000]   We mean a lot of things.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   It's a more fodder for the rumor mill I think.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.880]   It's our last chance to speculate next week all our imaginations will be worth nothing.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.560]   Well, Jimmy Kimmel has a little bit of a scoop the other night on the larger iPad.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.920]   I just thought I'd show you the video so that you know what to expect.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   Can you pull that up?
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920]   Do you have any ability?
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.920]   There we go.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   This is Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.440]   Now this woman if you've seen this before this is what it's going to look like with the
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440]   new iPad.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.440]   The new iPad.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.800]   It's a little it's kind of like the surface table.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.800]   Thank you.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   Thank you, Jimmy.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.800]   Huh?
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.640]   You know, wacky prop comedy just make it way.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.400]   I like prop comedy.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.200]   Bring me back here at Top and Gallagher.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.680]   I love it.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.920]   And you know, it works.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.000]   It actually has a camera that's it's working.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.840]   Carl Maldon's Kleenex box.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.440]   Well, you're going to mention the Fox news newsroom that's got the giant tablets that
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:26.440]   are larger than humans.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.440]   Those are surfaces.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.920]   Although, they're normal size to Clayton Morris.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.400]   I don't know how that works.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:37.960]   Well, I was watching Dead Mouse yesterday on the iTunes Festival, which by the way, Apple
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.560]   deserves a lot of credit.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.160]   Audio, video stream, remarkable.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.720]   I'm watching on the high-def TV listening on a very good surround sound system and it
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720]   sounded great.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:54.240]   And apparently this mouse fellow uses a Microsoft Pixel Perfect display as one of his touch
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   screen.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.080]   So Apple get in on that because I'm sure he'd like to be using an Apple product is all
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.080]   celebrities do.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.720]   You hear a lot of artists say they love Apple stuff, but you know, when I hear about this
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:10.440]   iPad Pro rumor, that's what I start to think of is that people like artists who really
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.080]   want to use and try very hard despite the fact that the digitizers are way better on
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.320]   some Android tablets and Microsoft tablets.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.480]   They want to use the iPad.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.640]   And if Apple, maybe that's the product that finally speaks to them.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   Here's a big story.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.600]   Speaking of many years in the business, right about when you were a cover reporter at Mac
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:35.120]   user magazine, a 14 year old named Anand Lal Shimpi started a non-tech started blogging
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.680]   about the tech industry.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.920]   In the intervening 17 years, he has become without a doubt one of the most interesting,
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.560]   most intelligent and accurate reviewers of products.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.920]   Nobody tests things like Anand tech.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:54.080]   Anand announced kind of shockingly that he was retiring from tech journalism on his
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.080]   blog.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.840]   What he didn't say is where he was going.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.840]   Apple.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.400]   What will Anand do at Apple?
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.560]   Either way, I'm embarrassed because I immediately sent him a note saying Anand if you'd like
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.320]   to be on Twitter from now on, you can.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.600]   And then I found out he was going to work for Apple.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.960]   Are you going to work for Apple?
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   Anything to that rumor?
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.760]   I have nothing to report.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.400]   Although it reminds me a little bit of when Michael Gartenberg, the analyst who was an
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.200]   auth quoted and he wrote a column for us and Mac and Computer World.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.560]   And then he got hired by Apple and you know, went over to the dark side.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.440]   And he's well, although he was an analyst, so it's debatable.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.440]   Right.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.440]   He was already on the dark side.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.440]   He was already on the side of good.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.800]   And I think Anand has always liked Apple products, but pretty positive about products.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.040]   He's been invited to the last few Apple events.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.040]   He's taken their...
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.040]   Oh wow.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040]   He's a big job.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.240]   And he's taken their chip stuff really seriously.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.720]   He's really broken down what Apple's been doing with the A process.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.640]   That's why he's invited by it.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   So what do you think you'll do?
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.160]   I think a smart thing for Apple to do would be have somebody bloody an independent-minded
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.960]   like Anand kind of before these products are shipped to his reviews.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.000]   Say, "Look, here's what's wrong with this.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.960]   Here's what a reviewer is going to say about this.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.000]   Wouldn't that be useful to have somebody like that?"
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   I think he's an Apple fellow.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.560]   And Sam has done that for a while.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.360]   Sam's like an HTC, both hired bloggers for a while to sort of be internal reviewers.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:21.000]   And also to keep the eye on the competition to see what Apple is...
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.080]   I mean, he's just a really smart guy.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:27.120]   I look at this and think, "Good to have a smart guy like him on your team.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.240]   He's bottom line and find a way to use him."
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.400]   I mean, that's how I felt about Gartenberg, too.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   It was the same thing.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.400]   It's like, "Wow, he's really smart."
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.960]   And now he's playing for Apple.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.720]   And Apple gets all of his information.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.520]   And none of the rest of us get to hear it.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.160]   They take it all the way.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.520]   Previously, but 9 to 5 Mac reported on it at the same time that Anand's mobile editor,
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.320]   Brian Clue, got gone there several months earlier.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   Brian's great, too.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.160]   Brian's reviews of the iPhone were stunning.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   Red and intelligent.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.440]   There was an amazing message board post that somebody linked to that was from a few months
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.280]   ago that basically said, "I think these guys are going to leave an on-tech."
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.560]   And it was like a prediction.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.360]   And they totally called it just by reading the tea leaves.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360]   But it's fascinating.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.360]   So those are two...
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.400]   An on-tech will continue.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:14.600]   And I think Anand feels that it'll continue to do well, but they've taken these two incredible
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.840]   talents and brought them on the inside.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   So who's next?
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.880]   Maybe that's why they haven't invited you, Leo.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.400]   Is there planning for the job interview?
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.180]   How much I thought about this last night.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:27.080]   Would it take for Apple to hire me away?
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.040]   Oh, it's a good question.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.680]   You've been saying time and time again how sad you are you haven't been invited.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.120]   Are you throwing a double bluff at us so we don't know that you've actually been taking
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.680]   meetings and that they're measuring you for the golf shirt?
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   You figured it out.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.040]   You'll know when I take the stage next to Tim Cook and Phil Schiller next Tuesday.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.920]   But I think it's smart to hire.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:57.360]   In fact, I think they should hire people who actively criticize responsibly and with thoughtfulness
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   what they're doing.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.680]   Well Anand is that perfect person for that.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.960]   And he was always extremely objective.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.080]   He's so knowledgeable, especially about the processor stuff.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.080]   And so to have him...
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080]   It's a good excuse that too.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.040]   Well, I keep saying they should hire John Syracuse, but John Syracuse doesn't want to move to California
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   anyway.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   Our technique is brilliant.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.840]   He's a freelancer though, right?
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:18.840]   He's got a day job.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840]   He's a web programmer.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.440]   He does the podcast and his OS X reviews for ours in his spare time.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.800]   Those OS X reviews are like Anand's reviews of the hardware.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.800]   They are definitive.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.800]   Definitive.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.800]   Yes.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.120]   I'm thrilled for Anand.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.600]   I love the guy.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.840]   We started interviewing him when he was in his teens on the screensavers.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.680]   And I just think he's such a great guy and I'm glad for him.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.480]   But I think it's a loss to us as readers of...
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.360]   It reminds me of the...in the baseball world when Moneyball took off and Sabre Metrics
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   took off.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.720]   There were all these great writers who wrote for sites like Baseball Perspectives.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:59.800]   And most of those people got hired by baseball teams.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.320]   And like even Bill James, the father of...
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.320]   Well, it's Bill James.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.240]   He got hired by the Boston Red Sox.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.240]   Most of these people now work secretly.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.240]   Right.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.200]   Trying to get a business advantage and good for them because those are good jobs and I'm
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.640]   sure they pay way better than baseball prospectus did.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.640]   But I feel like...
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   Well, we've rebuilt James non-stop.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.480]   And I feel like that's sort of happening with something like Anand going behind the curtain.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.800]   It's like a great for him, great for Apple.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.800]   And it's a loss for us.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.800]   It's a bit of a loss.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800]   Because we don't get his thoughts to us now.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.320]   Jason and I have seen this a lot.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.880]   I went from product marketing at a company to working in basically media.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.960]   But there are a lot of people who go from media to PR and back and forth because they're
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.040]   basically inverse skills.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.760]   You went from bodyguard to media.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:39.920]   So I think that's...
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.920]   I don't know why that...
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.920]   I went from bodyguard to...
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:42.920]   I taught.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920]   I never practiced.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.080]   But I went from product marketing to media.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.960]   Are you like a super duper black belt in jujitsu?
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.960]   No.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   What do you...
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   So like, if I...
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.760]   Next time I see you, you're not going to kick my ass, are you?
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   No.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   Okay.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.760]   No.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   I'm going to be nicer to you.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760]   That's a peaceful day.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.120]   I am going to watch my step, Andy.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.840]   There's so much we could talk about, but you know what?
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.560]   We're going to reconvene next week and have even more.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.040]   So this might be a good time to move.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.400]   We'll have actual phones.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   Actual.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400]   I want the five and a half.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.280]   If I don't want the four at seven and they're going to break my heart because they're going
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.480]   to say the five and a half is available in December or something.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.080]   And I'm going to be stuck using this Android crap.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.240]   Except very excited.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.440]   We will cover just so people know.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.320]   Tomorrow is Samsung event to release a note.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.040]   Four is six AM our time.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.600]   But I think I'm going to come in and just kind of buy...
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.680]   I'll wear my jammies and my slippers and buy myself.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   We'll do that.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.680]   It'll be like the New Year's thing all over again.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.000]   John, you're making another that.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   Six AM.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   Okay.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.640]   And then the fourth is the Moto X announcement.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.240]   I'm a fan of the Moto X.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   I thought that was the best phone of the year in many respects.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.080]   So I'll be very interested in what they've done to update that.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.240]   They certainly need to improve the camera and the screen.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.920]   There's a great line in the chat room.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   Renee is secretly Wolverine.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.720]   He's the best he is and what he does.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:00.720]   He does.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:01.720]   What he does is extremely nice.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.280]   I think I English to claim Wolverine before I could.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.720]   Got my English now.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.440]   That's a fake name.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.760]   That's a fake name.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.600]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.600]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.600]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.000]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.520]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.240]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.640]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.240]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.880]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.160]   I'm a fan of the United States.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.160]   You'll start with one of their 25 beautiful templates.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   They have a logo creator tool.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160]   So if you're a small business, you can't afford an artist.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   You can create a logo right there very quickly.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.160]   Great workshops that help you if you have any trouble.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160]   Self-help articles too.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.160]   And of course the best help and support in the business
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   right from the Squarespace offices 24/7.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.160]   It's inexpensive too.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.160]   It starts at $8 a month.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   And that includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.160]   It also, by the way, includes e-commerce.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   Every site has e-commerce, mobile responsive.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160]   It just, it goes on and on and on.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   I want you there, there are apps, the metrics app for the iPhone
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.160]   and the iPad let you follow your site and keep track of stats
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   like page views, unique visitors, even social media followers.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   I just think this is spectacular.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   Please try it.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   The best part is you can try it for free.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.160]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.160]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.160]   They won't ask for a credit card or anything.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:02.160]   You can have two weeks import your data.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.160]   They have importers for all the major blog platforms if you have an existing site.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.160]   And notice, by the way, how decoupled the design is from your content.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   You can try every one of those 25 templates with a click of the mouse
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.160]   and then completely customize it and your contents, you know, completely the same.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.160]   Even the images, the links, the SEO, everything.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.160]   If you decide you want to buy and I think you will, please do me a favor
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.160]   and use the offer code Mac break.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160]   That will get you 10% off your new site.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.160]   A better web awaits and it starts with your Squarespace website.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.160]   squarespace.com.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160]   Try it free.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.160]   Use the offer code Mac break when you decide to buy.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.160]   Time for our tips of the week.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.160]   Let's start with Andy and not co.
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.160]   My pick this week is a really cool iOS photo filter app called Tangled FX
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:56.160]   where it will take the original source file and it does one thing only.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.160]   It just basically redoes it as swirls of either threads or paint brushes.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.160]   And as bored as you might be with the idea of another, oh, look, it makes it like paint brush.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:08.160]   You have not seen how good this thing does.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.160]   I have the, you said us the link.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160]   This is the original.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.160]   And who is that?
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.160]   That was a Dr. Hu cosplayer from Boston Comic Con a couple of weeks ago.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.160]   I should have known from the Brocade Invest.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.160]   And then you have, oh, you've turned him into Vincent van Gogh, I think.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.160]   I mean, zoom in too, because that's the detail in that that's not even the high resolution
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.160]   version of that picture.
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.160]   Wow.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.160]   And it just, it got every single one of those strands of hair.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.160]   It was also smart enough to realize that the circles in the eyes should not be like swirled into
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.160]   incomprehensible.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.160]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.160]   And then it's obviously some pictures work better than others.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160]   And this is not something where you're going to.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.160]   It's not, it's not like a photo processing tool where you want to, you improve every photo with it.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   But sometimes you encounter a photo where it really does something really, really great with
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.160]   it.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.160]   Or as I often say, when I come across these different like oil painting sort of transmogrifiers,
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.160]   sometimes you get a picture there.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.160]   It's a little bit blurry.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.160]   So you can't use it or use the phone use went to super high ISO.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.160]   So it looks very grainy.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.160]   So you can't use it.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:15.360]   But if you apply a filter like this to it, it suddenly looks like it obliterates all that
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:19.160]   sort of stuff that made it unusable and turns into something actually interesting and worthy
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160]   of sharing.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160]   Tangled FX.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   Two bucks.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   Not tangled.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.160]   The storybook selects from Disney.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   That's another tangled.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   Although it would probably do with all that hair, they would probably do a very good job
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   on that frame too.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.160]   And two bucks and yeah, there's an iPad version as well as a iPhone version.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   That is.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]   So it's not just the Van Gogh effect.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160]   It does also just right there.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.160]   There about a dozen of them and each one of them.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:47.160]   Now the interface is a little bit not iOS optimized, but that's kind of a good thing because you can
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.760]   do a reveal and get access to every slider that the algorithm approaches.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.240]   So if you think that G though be nice, but there isn't enough detail there or they lost
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.560]   some of the color, you can say, okay, just give me more detail.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.560]   Give me more color.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.720]   Add this to hyperlapse and it's another reason why I'm actually, you know, I've been using
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.080]   Android for a long time because I like the bigger screens.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.120]   I want a bigger screen and I want, I hate the iPhone keyboard.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   It's unusable.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:13.640]   And in my opinion, it's just ergonomically brain dead.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.080]   They're going to fix both of those things.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.960]   And then if I have a bigger, you know, a five and a half inch and these apps, I don't know
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.240]   if I'll ever go back to Android.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.760]   I'm just, I was, as I was, as I was using this yesterday, someone on Twitter was nice
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.200]   enough to like suggest this to me.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.080]   So I was playing with it yesterday and I have to say the only thing that I'm totally
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.360]   miss about the iPhone is access to apps like these because these really weird but exceptionally
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.760]   well done apps are not available for Android.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.960]   The marketplace Android is great no matter what you need and even most of the stuff you
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:42.480]   want is there too.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.800]   But the people who, the weird people come up with this, their first choice is never Android.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   And even Instagram who did hyper left.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.480]   So we can't do it on Android until they have the gyroscope function, which they'll have
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.480]   in L, but they don't have right now.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.840]   Like I said at WWDC, if Apple does come up with that really big screen iPhone with,
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.080]   and they deliver on iOS 8, I am running out of reasons to keep using Android.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.000]   I'm drooling.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]   Thank you.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.680]   Andrew and not co, Mr. Jason Snell.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:09.680]   How about you?
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.680]   You got something for us?
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:16.280]   A little while ago, a company, a startup created an interesting iOS and it's now on Android
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:21.320]   Mail app called Mailbox and they were purchased by Dropbox.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.680]   And this is, it's mostly for Gmail, although it works with, I think works with other services.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:26.960]   Anyway, there's a Mac beta now.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.560]   And since this is Mac break weekly, I thought I'd mention the fact that they now have a
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.560]   beta.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.520]   You have to sign up for it or if you have a friend who has it, you can get what they're
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.840]   calling a beta coin, but you can request a beta coin and within, I got one within a
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:39.840]   week.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.920]   I'm going to get it on iOS so I should be able to get it.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.760]   And so it syncs, if you're using it on iOS, it will sync up and now you can use it on
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.120]   your Mac and it goes back and forth.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.760]   And the trick with Mailbox is it allows you to triage your mail very quickly.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.160]   You can, if you're like me, you use your inbox as sort of a to-do list.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.840]   And one of the nice things about Mailbox is it lets you say, okay, I do need to deal
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.400]   with this, but not right now.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.920]   And, and set a timer and basically say, tell me about this tomorrow.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.760]   Tell me about this next week, whenever.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.920]   And then it goes out of your inbox, but it's still there in the background waiting to
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.520]   come back in your face at a more appropriate time.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:15.120]   So you can get down to zero, but still have things on your to-do list if you work like
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120]   that.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.120]   And that's how I work with my inbox.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.320]   So this was quite a breakthrough.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:26.960]   This app, like Delicious Library, spawned a whole bunch of ideas of how to demand data.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.960]   Yes.
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.280]   It's a different way of handling Mail and triaging Mail and it doesn't work for everybody, but
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.360]   it really works pretty well for me.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.360]   So I'm using Mailbox for Mac right now.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.120]   And we'll see how it goes, but I really like the idea that you can with just a few swipes,
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:47.200]   you can delete a message, you can mark it as red, or you can set it to come back at a
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.200]   later time.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.000]   And then it comes back later to remind you.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000]   Mailbox.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.240]   iOS now beta for OS 10.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.560]   And if you have an iOS version, you can get a token and get it.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:57.560]   Exactly.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560]   And it's from a mailbox app.com.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.560]   Love it.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.800]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.400]   I have a few picks because it's going to depend exactly what you want to use on your own personal
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400]   taste.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.440]   But one of the things we like to do when there's a security problem is give people as much
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.600]   help as we can on making this stuff more secure.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.800]   So we put up a list of secure encrypted or ephemeral photo apps so that if you do want
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:24.600]   to share personal photos, you can do it with an app whose only purpose is to keep those
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.800]   apps secure.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.520]   So it's going to pull it up because I lost the window, of course.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.840]   So you have several things to choose from here.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.440]   I apologize for the delay.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:35.960]   No problem.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.160]   You have Snapchat, which a lot of people use, might not be as secure as possible.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.200]   But there's a large likelihood that the person that you know of is using that.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.440]   There's also Sitcher.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.600]   There's Avocado.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   There's Bonfire.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.600]   There's Confide.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.360]   There's Cyber Dust, which we mentioned earlier.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.360]   So you have your choice.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.600]   You can go and look at them and you can see this one does encryption.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.680]   This one just deletes it immediately.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.000]   This one makes it a hard to screenshot it or capture it.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.160]   And there's a whole list along with the pros and cons for each one, sort of what each one
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.520]   does well and what each one does badly.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.440]   And if you do want to do this, and again, it's a perfectly normal thing for anybody you
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.240]   want to do, you can do it with something that is designed to protect your privacy from
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.240]   the beginning.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240]   Nice.
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.240]   Shh.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.240]   Yes.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:18.240]   Private photo sharing and iMore.com.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.760]   The list is there.
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.680]   We do know that Snapchat saves those images on its server.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680]   So.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.800]   Yeah, the advantage of Snapchat is just that it's for a mainstream person, for someone who's
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]   not a celebrity.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.240]   And a lot of people who you know might already be using it.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.240]   So it's you.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.760]   And avocado is one of the couple apps that I mentioned that you pair with another person
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.080]   and share your data just with them, your significant other.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.800]   And that's of course where all my dirty pictures are.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.360]   So and there's this Mark Cuban's cyber dust.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.360]   Good article.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.360]   Did you mention couple?
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.360]   That's another one like avocado.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.360]   We didn't.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.360]   I'll take a look at it.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.800]   And God, I hope they don't get hacked.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.880]   Not that anybody wants nude pictures of me.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.880]   I don't know.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.160]   Leo, maybe that's what would turn around the Apple situation for you to say.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.160]   Oh, I didn't.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.520]   I didn't know he had that kind of abs.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.520]   All right.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   That's those was.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.520]   Word.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.520]   I want to meet this dashing young sailor.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.800]   They do it every time.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.400]   I mentioned the iTunes festival.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.600]   It just started yesterday with an amazing performance by Deadmauce at the Roundhouse
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   in London.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.240]   30 days of performances.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.360]   Beck is performing right now.
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.040]   And you can watch it on, of course, your iOS device.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.840]   But if you've got an Apple TV, I highly recommend tuning in the iTunes festival on your Apple
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.920]   TV.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:43.720]   I was just really enjoying it at homeless yesterday blasting a Deadmauce.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.320]   There's Beck performing right now.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.800]   And or about to perform.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.960]   He hasn't taken the stage yet.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.400]   I'm blown away by what Apple is able to do.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:58.720]   But not only the camera work, but the quality of the stream and the quality of the audio.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.360]   This is state of the art video stream.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.000]   I don't think anybody does it better than Apple.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000]   Really.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.680]   I actually think that the one of the reasons they now live stream their events is the expertise
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.040]   they built up by doing the iTunes festival.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]   iTunes Festival.com.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.040]   iTunes Festival.com.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.960]   But the best way, in my opinion, to do it is fire up your Apple TV.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.800]   They've added an icon on the Apple TV.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.920]   As you can see, Beck has knit to take the stage.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.080]   So if you'd like to tune out and start watching, go ahead.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.080]   Be my guest.
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:26.480]   It's like the us festival only.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.040]   It's probably revenue positive.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:32.480]   Poor Steve Wozniak lost much of his fortune in that.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.080]   The other pick I have, because of Labor Day in the United States yesterday, we didn't
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.800]   do iPad today, and I would have mentioned BioShock.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:48.680]   The original BioShock is now available, ported to the iPad for $15.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.000]   I thought it would load because usually I have all my apps will load automatically,
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.160]   but it's not yet loading.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.880]   So it's such a massive application.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.120]   So I can't show you.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.280]   But for those of you who played BioShock, which in my opinion is one of the great games, this
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:05.000]   is the first in the trilogy, not the most recent, but the first they're underwater and
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.520]   rapture.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.360]   It was a great game.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:12.640]   I have some qualms about recommending first person shooters on the iPad.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:20.200]   It uses the standard first person shooter iPad technique of the left side is your movement
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.440]   and the right side is your point of view and you tap things to fire.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.320]   I just find first person shooters in general not to be well suited to the iPad, but they
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.760]   have done a good job of converting it.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.960]   The artwork is excellent.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.360]   The story is incredible.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.960]   If you're willing to spend $15, it was $60 originally.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.800]   So you're saving some money.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.800]   That's BioShock.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.800]   So you want more premium games, support premium games?
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.880]   And I still have to say, I think in general that I prefer games that are designed for
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:46.880]   touch.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.560]   I just think that they work better.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:55.520]   Things like Fruit Ninja, just such natural games on the iPad, dots because they use swipes,
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.640]   they use touch and the first person shooter ports in general leave me wanting.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.440]   However, this is an excellent port.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.120]   I mean, they've got the full time there.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.120]   Classic.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.880]   Yeah, one of the best games of all time.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.880]   BioShock.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.880]   These fast Twitch games, I prefer to have mechanical buttons underneath my hands.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.480]   They make some third party joysticks.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.960]   It probably would work fine on these.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.960]   I guess I don't know.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.160]   We tell you get your new Apple TV with its controller.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.560]   Yeah, but it's about to say.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.160]   Yeah, it needs a controller.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.680]   I've been playing Diablo 3 with on a console.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.760]   And boy, that game is better on a console.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.720]   I played it on my Apple when it came out.
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:33.320]   But really, the console controller is great.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.640]   Thank you, my friends.
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:35.640]   You rock.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.760]   And we will see you Tuesday for what promises to be, I think, the most exciting Apple event
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.600]   in five years, four or five years.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.600]   Big day.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:44.600]   You will all be there.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.600]   I will be here anchoring our coverage.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.160]   It begins 10 AM Pacific.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:55.120]   That is, let's see, 1 PM Eastern times 1700 UTC with the Apple stream and our commentary.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.960]   I know it'll be me, Mike Elgin and Sarah Lane.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.600]   We'll see if we can find anybody else who hasn't invited them.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.160]   Invite them.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.920]   The island of unloved hosts.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.600]   And I hope we'll have streaming video at least a little bit.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:13.680]   Worst case, we'll do FaceTime with Andy and Renee down there at the event after you get
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.120]   to touch whatever it is Apple is sticking out.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.120]   Show title.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.560]   We almost made it.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.880]   Whatever it is, Apple is sticking out.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:25.760]   Don't take a picture of that on iCloud.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.720]   So close.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.320]   And Jason, now we love having you.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.920]   You come up anytime, Theincompible.com, the site for his podcast, which are truly incomparable.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:35.920]   We'll really enjoy them.

[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.320]   Did you get it?
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.320]   I got it.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.320]   You got it?
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.320]   Hover.
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:50.320]   You're in the Snell Zone.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.320]   Stay tuned.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.320]   There's more.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.320]   And you can make it out.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.000]   And he can make a sombre.com out of the Snell Zone.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]   Sure.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]   You need a nice Fox News sort of anthem.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000]   Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000]   dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000]   I'm working on it.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000]   I'm working on it.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000]   A man, a machine, a snare.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000]   It's called their report.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000]   Thank you everybody for being here.

[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   So please, and of course our great third party apps.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:45.840]   Many, many really nice apps developed by fans on all the major platforms including Roku.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:46.840]   Just search for Twit.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.840]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.640]   Now get back to work because you know what?
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640]   Great time.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:54.040]   So good.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:01.440]   [Music]
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:05.040]   You guys are just going to have a great time in beautiful Cupertino.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.240]   Enjoy the baked goods.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.240]   Apple often has a very nice Danish.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.760]   We'll see what they have at the Flint Center.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.760]   Look on the bright side.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:15.960]   Maybe this is like one of those 30 days later scenarios where you'll be the only person
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:21.920]   to survive because of the zombie outbreak that was epicentered at the Flint Center.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:25.680]   The new iPhone falls on us and kills us.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.880]   You're going to have the far shot.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:34.880]   Oh!
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.880]   A man all alone.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:36.880]   [Laughs]
